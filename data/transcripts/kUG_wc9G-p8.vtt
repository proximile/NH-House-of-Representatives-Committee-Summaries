00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
for the committee the only thing that HB
 
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
1712 changes from 66 is the date we're
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
asking for your permission to continue
 
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
our commission for another year um to
 
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
remind you what this is about
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
as you are whereare um there is and was
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
an opioid crisis and one of the
 
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations Nationwide on dealing
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
with that was to increase
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
access uh to or to provide alternative
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
therapies for pain which sounded like a
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
really wonderful idea the minor problem
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
is is we don't provide any access to any
 
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
of that so I've been involved in a
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
nationwide effort for almost 30 years to
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
try to help solve that problem um and we
 
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:30.919 align:start position:0%
have haven't really been able to do it
 
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 align:start position:0%
in a coste effective way I actually
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
wrote a paper on barriers to resolving
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
this issue that's five pages long that I
 
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
presented at a meeting and and a lot of
 
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
them are unnecessary barriers people
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
guarding Turf things like that and so we
 
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
felt that it was really important that
 
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
in a statutory way we develop a program
 
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
whereby we in provide access to these
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
therapies and what we call an
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
integrative way and what that means is
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
that we're concerned about fragmentation
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
of care and now where the chiropractor
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
does this the doctor does that the
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
massage therapist does that but nobody's
 
00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
talking to each other and we know that
 
00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
system doesn't work so and we've known
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
since 1984 that when those groups of
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
people work together it does work the
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
other thing that was important is that
 
00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
we do this in a New Hampshire way um
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
people have done this all over the
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
country the problem is is when we looked
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
at this it didn't seem their models
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
worked well and I'm really an advocate
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
of community-based care which means that
 
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
we include all the providers in the
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
community in ative way and 30 years ago
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
we had no problems doing that um now we
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
struggle to do that and I want to we
 
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to find ways to do that um so
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
that's what the goal of the committee
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
was was to look at that issue create a
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
pilot program that we could um show to
 
00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:48.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the insurers the world
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
whatever that this can be done in a
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
coste effective Manner and I will
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
underline cost effective um we met 10
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
times um I was really excited with our
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
group um you know you know you never
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
know what you're going to get um there
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
were five of us legislators which I knew
 
00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
they were going to be there U
 
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
representative McKay representative
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
Merchant um myself um representative
 
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
lungren uh Senator chanelly and probably
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
missing somebody but anyways oh
 
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
represented collabro um we met we um
 
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
achieved a quorum at every meeting and
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
that wasn't the best part of this the
 
00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
best part was the stakeholders who
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
showed up for every meeting um we had a
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
very unusual group of people that
 
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:31.240 align:start position:0%
actually communicated with each other um
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
sen uh we had insurers together Patient
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
Advocates together representatives from
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
virtually every type of modality and
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
everybody was really interested in
 
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
solving this problem I think the one
 
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
group of people that interested me the
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
most that showed up to every meeting
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
with the people from hospice and
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
paliative care who I never
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
anticipated as this being a need for
 
00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
them and they actually help guide us to
 
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
solve our problem because Hospice in our
 
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
country provides a bundled comprehensive
 
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
integrative way of managing pain and
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
symptoms at end of life and what we
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
discovered was we're really good at
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
treating people when they're dying we're
 
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
not so good at treating them when
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
they're living and they informed us that
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
there's two parts to hospice and
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
paliative care that's the hospice the
 
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
paliative care part those the people
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
that aren't going to die tomorrow they
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
may live years with their problems and
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
they found out that they have the same
 
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
problems that we have in pain management
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
in general as they don't have access to
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
these Services an integrative bundled
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
way so they showed us the way and we
 
00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:37.639 align:start position:0%
want to follow it um so that's basically
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
what we did last year was We we wanted
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
to research the field see what
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
everybody's saying we brought in
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
speakers from all over the country um we
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
were honored to be added to a Nationwide
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
Consortium of uh comprehensive
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
integrative pain providers which
 
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
actually we start meeting in a month um
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
that was step one um and we pretty much
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
completed that the next step is figuring
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
out how we're going to make this thing
 
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
real and there were five steps to that
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
number one is where are we going to do
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
it which we think we've already solved
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
who's going to do it which we have to
 
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
work on how we're going to pay for it
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
which we're getting steps towards doing
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
that um how we're going to collect the
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
data on all this thing and what's our
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
focus group going to be because I wanted
 
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
this to be more broad but it's turning
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
out that that's not going to be the case
 
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
so three of those five things we pretty
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
much already solved the next phase that
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
we want to do through next year is
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
actually to work on those and then the
 
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
third thing is obviously to make the
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
thing real and exist and we pretty much
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
think we already have two sites to do
 
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
that so at this point all I'm asking you
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
to do is to um support the bill from
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
last year extend our commission for
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
another year um and then hopefully by
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
this time next year um we'll be able to
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
give you good news that this thing is
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
actually working and I will tell you the
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
entire country is watching what we're
 
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
doing um because this is a very unique
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
model so I'm open any questions any
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative Seth King thank
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh thank you for taking
 
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
questions why are you asking for um an
 
00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
extension of only one year why not
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
multiple years and if we ever do see
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
like you said that this commission is
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
working will it then be multiple years
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
um um I that's a great question and um
 
00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
if I had my way I would have extended it
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
for three years which probably should
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
have done we decided to just do it this
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
way um but I think your idea is a good
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
idea one thing you'll be interested in
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
is um one of the things that we realize
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's a big difference between rural
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
and urban Health you're in a rural
 
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
environment last I checked you haven't
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
had a big city grow up recently right
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
now so um we felt that we needed two
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
separate models because they're very
 
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
different so there's going to be a rural
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
and an urban component to what we do and
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
I thought that was one of the neatest
 
00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
things that came out of this so far
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
um representative Wendy Thomas thank you
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
question um you know this is going to be
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
asked by me um have you considered um or
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
are you considering the role of
 
00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis in pain management
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
my my I've been doing pain management
 
00:13:21.189 --> 00:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
now for almost 40 years um in that time
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
frame I have a very biblical perspective
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
on this the house of pain is a house
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
with many rooms and there's place for
 
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
everyone in the book that I wrote on
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
Pain Care policy there is a chapter on
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis use and Pain Care um there's
 
00:13:36.189 --> 00:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
nothing that's going to be
 
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
excluded so thank
 
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480 align:start position:0%

balanced out one of each caucus we uh we
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's a mutual agreement uh we are going
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
to change the order up a little bit
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
today uh in consideration of um those
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%

gone um and um so um we're going to be
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
working on the Bill's notice but we are
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
going to be changing the order a bit uh
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
1585 uh we are going to take up at
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
1M uh so we're going to start with HB
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
1712 which we just heard from
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel and I'll repres
 
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
I'll recognize representative Nagel for
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
motions I we have a question um we going
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
to amend that as outlined to increase
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
the life of
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
the uh the thingle
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
2027 um we don't have the amendment yet
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
okay have you put the request in yeah I
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
just wrote something do they think
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to get it to us
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
today I don't know I just sent it like
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
now should I it's a pretty simple
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'd suggest we just uh wait
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
till we get that Amendment and then take
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
it up when we do hopefully that'll be
 
00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
today simp am hopefully we get it done
 
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
should I call them or um I'll send them
 
00:36:57.069 --> 00:36:57.079 align:start position:0%
an email to just encourage their speed
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
if they can thank you okay
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
so again where it's simple language it's
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be a big change so all
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
right so we'll revisit uh 1712 moving on
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
hb1010 I'll recognize representative
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
Missour thank you Mr
 
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
chair I would like to move hb1010 to
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
interim study I'll second that motion
 
00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
representative Missour yes uh as we
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
heard from represent pres ative kushman
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
um was not here today but she has
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
requested this be moved to interm study
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
as we saw at the hearing there was a lot
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
of interest in this subject and it was
 
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
very clear to myself and I know others
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
that this isn't a very important subject
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
and more work and research should be
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
done on it and uh hoping that can be
 
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
done in an interim study thank you any
 
00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.910 align:start position:0%
done in an interim study thank you any
other

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Shapiro
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
yes um I would support interim study
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
because um I feel that I'm in favor of
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
people having as many options medical
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
options as they can as long as they're
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
not hurting other people um even if it's
 
00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
risky um but I I had a difficulty with
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
the bill as it was written because it
 
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
seems to
 
00:38:21.309 --> 00:38:21.319 align:start position:0%
take on the one hand the commission on
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
certified Midwifery seems to have the
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
ability to um
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
to govern the both the requirements and
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
the scope of practice and yet we were
 
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
going to bypass them and do it in a you
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
know in a legislative bill so I think
 
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
that um perhaps there's something that
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
can be done to make the bill better that
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do that um and encourage more
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
choice so I would support interim study
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative n thank
 
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um thanks for oh never
 
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
mind sor sorry that's called a kneejerk
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
it's early um I I support interm study
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
as well I will always have problems with
 
00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
these shortcut scope of practice bills
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
um um I think that there's a lot of
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
issues with this bill I could never
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
support it at written but I think that
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
it certainly warrants
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
discussion okay any other
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the CLK
 
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
to call the roll motion is uh inm study
 
00:39:28.359 --> 00:39:30.550 align:start position:0%
to call the roll motion is uh inm study
on

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%

Republicans of both the house and the

Senate there is absolutely important
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
work to be done with this however it
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
needs more time and attention than we
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
can give before the deadline reaches us
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
um because we had heard such wonderful
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
testimony and we want to make sure that
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
we're able to make sure that our Li our
 
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
laws are appropriately protective but
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
not overly burdensome um I would ask the
 
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
committee to support an interim study on
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
this bill so so that we can not lose all
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
the important testimony that we received
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
in that hearing and we can get some good
 
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.109 align:start position:0%
in that hearing and we can get some good
work

00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%

Parmer yes I'm I'm glad you that you're
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
moving for interim study because my
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
concern was what was going to happen
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
being a border doctor um the the
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
difficulty of maybe getting records from
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire into Vermont where I work
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that'll be one of the
 
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
things that gets worked out thank you
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
I'll put that in the committee report as
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%

00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%

00:46:47.309 --> 00:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
McDonald I'm sorry uh
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
yes 18 Zer and to not voting there's no
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
objection we will put that on
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
consent um
 
00:46:59.790 --> 00:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
one bill that uh we uh also had noticed
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
for today is hb300 we had we've decided
 
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
to continue that until March 20th but I
 
00:47:08.109 --> 00:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
understand there might be some
 
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
discussion on that uh representative Lon
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you for that purpose um
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
I'll move in interum study just so that
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
we can officially be able to discuss
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
this bill for a few minutes um just as
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
our colleagues are over in Commerce and
 
00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
we can sort of address the approach that
 
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:23.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take on the bill if there's
 
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
anybody who'd be willing to second that
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative baz of
 
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
seconds thank you thank you Mr speak is
 
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079 align:start position:0%
your intention just for the purposes of
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
discussion but not an actual vote
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
correct um because in executive session
 
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
we can't just sit and talk on a bill
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
unless there's a motion on the on the
 
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
table so I will be withdrawing that
 
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
afterwards um I think that this bill is
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
very important especially because New
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's right to try law was passed
 
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
before there was Federal legislation to
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
allow it um there are conflicts between
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
the two and there would be new new
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
conflicts created with the language of
 
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
the bill and those conflicts between
 
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
what we would ask of companies to
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
provide their Therapeutics and what
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
they're required to do by the federal
 
00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:08.839 align:start position:0%
government to be able to continue
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
selling those Therapeutics around uh or
 
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
continue developing those Therapeutics
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
when they're in Conflict that's going to
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
limit any access that we have in the
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
state um so we have both the
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
investigational drugs that um are
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
allowed under compassionate use and
 
00:48:26.109 --> 00:48:26.119 align:start position:0%
there's other programs as well um I
 
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
believe that it's absolutely critical to
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that if a um company's not
 
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
able to open up a clinical trial site
 
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
for a patient who um where it would be
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
willing where there would be appropriate
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
compassionate use for that drug that we
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
provide a pathway so that the long and
 
00:48:46.589 --> 00:48:46.599 align:start position:0%
rigorous process of opening a single
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
patient um clinical trial site is not
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
required in allow order to allow
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
patients to have this access um it's I
 
00:48:55.549 --> 00:48:55.559 align:start position:0%
believe that it's also quite important
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
important that we point this language to
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
the bill that was passed last term about
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
informed about um off Lael drug use
 
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
because of a drug is already already
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
approved for a use but a physician is
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about that use off label in a
 
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
terminal patient we must make sure that
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
this a language would Point them to that
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
because as long as there is informed
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
consent documented um the medical boards
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
will not are prohibited from taking
 
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
action simply based upon the off label
 
00:49:28.349 --> 00:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
status of that drug um I do think that
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
it is important and I'll be speaking
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
with uh the medical board just to
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
understand if there's anything else that
 
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
would need to be done um prob most
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
likely um I would look to have the
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
language to have the medical board um
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
draft any rules necessary in order to
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
provide appropriate safety and
 
00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
protection for both the doctor and the
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
patient while maximizing availability to
 
00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:52.839 align:start position:0%
any Therapeutics um that would would
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
offer a chance at life extension or
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
potentially cure for any of these
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
patients um so I think it's an
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical bill um I I'm just
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
worried that the reason why it wasn't
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
working so well with our existing law is
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
because of the conflicts and I think
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
that this um would create some
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
additional conflicts so I this is one of
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
those ones that now that a couple other
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
things are done I can sort of stick my
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
nose to the grindstone and the next week
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
or so I'll make sure that it remains
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
gerine um so that we don't run into that
 
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
issue and um hopefully be able to do
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
something because is you know the last
 
00:50:28.349 --> 00:50:28.359 align:start position:0%
thing we want to do is have bureaucrats
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
and red tape get in the way of a patient
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
and Doctor Who want to try and extend or
 
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
save somebody's life is
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you um thank you Mr
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
chair and
 
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if this is a question or
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
statement but th this bill is really
 
00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:53.559 align:start position:0%
important I think and I think once again
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
people should have um
 
00:50:59.549 --> 00:50:59.559 align:start position:0%
as much Choice as possible as long as
 
00:51:03.549 --> 00:51:03.559 align:start position:0%
it's not doesn't endanger somebody else
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
um I didn't really understand why the
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
requirements for consent seemed to be
 
00:51:14.829 --> 00:51:14.839 align:start position:0%
um seem to be increased in this bill um
 
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
and in you know in my cursory reading
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
made it more honorous to consent um I
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
think there had to be two people and um
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
it had to be um notorized I think um so
 
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
I I hope that'll be looked into too
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
because I don't know why the consent
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
should be more honorous for this than
 
00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
for other
 
00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:38.839 align:start position:0%
things um I would tend to agree uh we
 
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
actually have the prime sponsor of the
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill filling in with us today so I don't
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
know if it would be appropriate to uh
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
see if he can give us any insight on uh
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
why he he made it a little more onerous
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
on the informed on the consent side
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative liwicki thank you Mr
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
chairman uh the reason for doing that is
 
00:51:54.789 --> 00:51:54.799 align:start position:0%
that when people are in a hospital
 
00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:56.839 align:start position:0%
environment uh they are subject to
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
coercion and medical people uh typically
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
we get group think from the uh medical
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
personnel I'm certainly willing to
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
revise it in some way but I think it's
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
very important that uh the witnesses uh
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
the to the informed consent yet the
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
informed consent truly be voluntary
 
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
rather than subject to uh medical
 
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
personnel knowing what's right and not
 
00:52:21.549 --> 00:52:21.559 align:start position:0%
allowing a patient to do what the
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
wants

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
wants
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative Lon
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um I think that
 
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
actually I'm wondering if that might be
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
something that we can tease out where
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
when the patient is requesting access to
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
it we keep the same streamlined but if
 
00:52:41.069 --> 00:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
the provider chooses to offer something
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
that's like this that then then um maybe
 
00:52:46.109 --> 00:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
we have the the the Board of Medicine or
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
somebody else give us some rules around
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
how to appropriately ensure that there
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
is consent when you are bringing
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
somebody in um when you're offering
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
something that's not current currently
 
00:52:58.109 --> 00:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
available would pursuing that path
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
resolve those concerns for
 
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you other discussion
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
um I just have a question uh regarding
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
the the bill so I'm going to ask you um
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
when my mom was in hospice once she got
 
00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
on um Perpetual morphine she they they
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
said she could no longer make any legal
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
decisions and so my brother had to step
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
in as the authority would that is that a
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
all I'm not really sure it's not
 
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
something that I had considered um I
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
think that you know having a family
 
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
member be um a witness to the informed
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
consent would certainly be appropriate
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
um and you know whether a patient you
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
know obviously if a patient is
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
effectively stoned they can't truly uh
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
give informed consent well a family
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
member could certainly assist I know
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
I've been through a similar situation
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
with my sister
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
and who did not have any kind of durable
 
00:54:02.349 --> 00:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
power of attorney and for 5 years it was
 
00:54:02.359 --> 00:54:05.349 align:start position:0%
power of attorney and for 5 years it was
a

00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
mess other discussion representative Lon
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um so there's a
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
little known law that we passed uh three
 
00:54:14.829 --> 00:54:14.839 align:start position:0%
years ago that allows for surrogacy
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
where if there's not an somebody who's
 
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
assigned um that they're able to go
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
through a chain of command the question
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
would be if um if if you would feel
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
comfortable handing over that
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility fully to somebody who's
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
who is um clearly somebody who's been
 
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
named by the person should be able to
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
make those decisions the question my
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
question would be if somebody who's a
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
surrogate so not officially named but
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
basically a a descending order of next
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
of kin would do that or if that perhaps
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
at that point at that point the person
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
is probably so close to it maybe we
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be experimenting or trying to
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
play God I'm just curious what your
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
Insight would be
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
there I think we could discuss this
 
00:54:57.789 --> 00:54:57.799 align:start position:0%
offline one of the situations you know
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
and this is subjective with my sister
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
was that she would get offer medications
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
and she would be incapable of making
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
decisions when the she got back on the
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
medications she did resume um being able
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
to work it and I I just think I'm not
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
sure we can hash this out right now
 
00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:15.910 align:start position:0%
sure we can hash this out right now
right

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
discussion saying none uh Mr chairman
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
may I withdraw my motion for inter study
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
please you may and learn to okay so um
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
at this point we've had the motion
 
00:55:34.109 --> 00:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
withdrawn on 1300 we'll continue it to
 
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
thir uh to March
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
20th and
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
um we can probably do this I can okay
 
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
next up we would will'll take up HB 1568
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
FN representative lons um thank you Mr
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd move interm study on House
 
00:55:53.069 --> 00:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
Bill 1568 relative to Medicaid
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for non-transport eery
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
mergency Medical Services Bill calls
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second representative
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
palazov representative palazov seconds
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative Leon do you wish to speak
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
to your motion um yes thank you Mr
 
00:56:09.309 --> 00:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
chairman uh this is a complicated and
 
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
complex bill that I'm not sure if should
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
really have come to Health and Human
 
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
Services but probably should have gone
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
to Commerce because I heard quite a few
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
discussions about M about um the sorted
 
00:56:23.789 --> 00:56:23.799 align:start position:0%
billing in that committee um if the
 
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
discussion can help clarify things for
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
me here then I may be interested in
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
another motion but right now I truly
 
00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
don't understand exactly where those
 
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
costs are going to go exactly who's
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
going to be liable um how this would I
 
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
recognize that there could be some
 
00:56:41.549 --> 00:56:41.559 align:start position:0%
benefit to those people the the towns
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
and other ambulance services but there's
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
going to be an offsetting cost as well
 
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
and I I truly don't have enough
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
information to pass the bill as it
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
stands but I think that it's too
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
valuable to kill so that's why I've made
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
the motion of interim
 
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
study other
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
Shapero yes um I I will vote against
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
interim study I think this is a um I I I
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
think I agree with the representative
 
00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:19.799 align:start position:0%
that it probably should have come to
 
00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:23.559 align:start position:0%
Commerce instead of to our committee um
 
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
but I think that um we did get a fair
 
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
amount of explanation and um the intent
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to have Medicaid
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for when um Emergency
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
Services goes out to a to a home or to
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere and um provide services um but
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to take
 
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
somebody transport someone to a hospital
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
and right now um emergency services are
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
eating those costs we know know there's
 
00:57:59.069 --> 00:57:59.079 align:start position:0%
a an issue with um emergency services in
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
the state um keeping them um robust and
 
00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:05.559 align:start position:0%
keeping them functioning and so I think
 
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
that we should be doing what we can to
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
support their functioning um by having
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement which will not be
 
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
enough of course um because Medicaid
 
00:58:19.069 --> 00:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is low um but it will be
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
doing something towards um ensuring the
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
um medical infrastructure for our state
 
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
so I would vote I would vote against
 
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
interim study I would urge people to
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
vote against interim study so that we
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
could um pass this along and maybe it
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
would go to um Commerce in the
 
00:58:41.069 --> 00:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
Senate is that
 
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
possible anything's possible it's up to
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
the Senate President okay anyway that is
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:58:50.829 --> 00:58:50.839 align:start position:0%
my thoughts okay representative Nagel
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I there's another
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
Committee involved in this and that's
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
Finance I mean there's a no not at all
 
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
really no it's too late it uh it's not a
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
second committee Bill W a second
 
00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
committee bills were weeks ago because
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
this is an expensive Bill
 
00:59:07.359 --> 00:59:09.109 align:start position:0%
this is an expensive Bill
potentially

00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
wow other discussion representative ATZ
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I um appreciate the
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
comments I I think it's really expensive
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
or it will be even more expensive if our
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
emergency service providers go out of
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
business which I think is a concern that
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
was raised I'm also very impressed by
 
00:59:29.309 --> 00:59:29.319 align:start position:0%
the showing that we have that I'm
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
assuming is related to this interest
 
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
given the uh insignias that I see on
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
people's clothes um because I can't tell
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
who all the lobbyists are so I I I heard
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
loud and clearly that there's a real ask
 
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
for this and it it makes sense that you
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
know we don't have to figure out the
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
details of how to make it happen we just
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
have to provide the the guidance that it
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
needs to get figured out and I would be
 
00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:53.720 align:start position:0%
also in favor of uh trying to make sure
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
we pass this and will vote against in
 
00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.870 align:start position:0%
we pass this and will vote against in
term

00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
study other discussion representative
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
Palmer yes I'm I'm also against interim
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
study um increasingly we have I've ended
 
01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
up taking care of patients in our small
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
critical access hospital that needed to
 
01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
be in a tertiary Care Center be for
 
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
longer than I would like because we
 
01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
could just not get
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
transport and so anything that
 
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
will improve the ability of of um am
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
ambulance services to provide service
 
01:00:33.789 --> 01:00:33.799 align:start position:0%
and staff appropriately I I think we
 
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
need to move in that direction and I
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
think the other thing is it's from a
 
01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:40.119 align:start position:0%
another point of view it's really not
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
fair for an ambulance service to go out
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
to somebody's house pick them up put
 
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
them in back in bed and then drive back
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
and not get paid anything for that
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
so thank you a representative n um I
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
also agree that those kinds of services
 
01:00:58.589 --> 01:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
should be covered as I've hit an age
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
group where more and more of my family
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
members are needing quick assistance but
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
not admission into a hospital so and of
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
course in nashwa it's only a couple
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
miles to get there from an ambulance so
 
01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of um not interm study but
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and let others work out
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
the details representative chapero thank
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I understand that um
 
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's
 
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
um idea of sending this inter term study
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
is not because she thinks it's a bad
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
idea but just because it that the
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
financial aspect of it has not been
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
fully examined and this is really a
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
question of the chair or anybody else
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
who might know can if we if we pass this
 
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
and put in our report that we think it
 
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
should go to finance in the Senate might
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
that have an influence and might um they
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
be be able to examine the financial um
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
dimensions and then it would come back
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
to the house
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
obviously um that's a possibility but
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
there's no way of knowing what as we
 
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
know our the other body is a pretty
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
independent group of people so I
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to try to say well we can
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
we can suggest we can suggest
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
yes other discussion representative Lon
 
01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I think that
 
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
this discussion has made both made me
 
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
realize the importance and also the
 
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
magnitude of this um recognizing that
 
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
there's probably people who aren't
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
calling for this now because they've had
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who's fallen and that they need
 
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
the assistance to get up I think that
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
it's very important but also if we're
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
under reimbursing through Medicaid we
 
01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
may actually be causing more of a
 
01:02:44.589 --> 01:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
problem too for these providers this is
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
not a good situation to be in and
 
01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
I my concern is just that there's so
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
much that Still Remains unknown on this
 
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
this um there's so many bills this year
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
that it's hard to count on the Senate to
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
do the hard work that um that we haven't
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
been able to figure out as well um so
 
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
this is that's just my my large concern
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
here representative Nagel um question
 
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
and a comment and a question I it
 
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
surprised me that this wasn't reimbursed
 
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
now that really surprised me but um um
 
01:03:21.269 --> 01:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
having seen a lot of visits that there's
 
01:03:23.789 --> 01:03:23.799 align:start position:0%
no transport involved but um my other
 
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
question is if this goes to interim
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
study it still stays in our committee
 
01:03:29.269 --> 01:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
correct it doesn't go to finance at that
 
01:03:32.029 --> 01:03:32.039 align:start position:0%
point am I correct uh that would be
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
correct but I know that we have had um
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
with interim Studies have people come in
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
not officially but have people from
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
other committees that can come and
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
discuss and help us better understand
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
what the implications are especially
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
because some of these would probably
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
then um because it would be drafting
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
another bill we'd probably want to look
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
at the expertise of people who could do
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
that so that we could introduce
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
something and perhaps uh have the
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
correct sponsors on that one so that it
 
01:03:57.870 --> 01:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
might go to the right committee um I
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
know that this year has just been so
 
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
difficult with with everything we're
 
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
doing the best we can all around um but
 
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
I I I just think that passing it and
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
hoping that somebody else would do the
 
01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:09.799 align:start position:0%
work for us is is not the right way to
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.359 --> 01:04:23.029 align:start position:0%
 
business

01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
okay m dire as always has been very
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
helpful apparently Commerce does not
 
01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
deal with Medicaid at all so that's
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's um uh which uh which I guess in
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
retrospect makes sense uh but she's
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
offered to do some research on this and
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
and enable us to make a a better
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
judgment if we want to continue this to
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
March 20th or we would have to withdraw
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
that motion um I'd be willing to
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
withdraw that motion I think that it's
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
important I just we just need to make
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
sure that we can understand what we're
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
actually doing with so I'd be willing to
 
01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
withdraw representative
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
Shapiro I I wonder if part of the
 
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
research that could be done would to be
 
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
to get some kind of financial um note
 
01:05:09.069 --> 01:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
about the implications of of passing
 
01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
this so um we could at least have an
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
idea of what we're working with
 
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:19.589 align:start position:0%
idea of what we're working with
representative

01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
TZ I want can we ask Mr Williams if
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
there's any information he could share
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
Williams okay thank you uh Christino is
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
that something is is any of the
 
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
financial stuff anything that you might
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
be able to check out for us
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.549 --> 01:05:51.559 align:start position:0%
or okay thank you representative TZ yeah
 
01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:53.559 align:start position:0%
thank I have one additional comment I
 
01:05:53.559 --> 01:05:55.109 align:start position:0%
thank I have one additional comment I
mean

01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
this is a public good that we don't
 
01:05:59.789 --> 01:05:59.799 align:start position:0%
think about until we need it so I kind
 
01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
of feel like it doesn't really matter
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
what the finances are it's a need New
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's a rural State we have all
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
these critical access hospitals that
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
have closed we're hearing that uh uh
 
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
emergency providers show up provide care
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
that is needed and if patients are lucky
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
enough to not have to be transported
 
01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
that's great um but if if that's ending
 
01:06:23.309 --> 01:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
up being a sort of a stop Gap care
 
01:06:27.549 --> 01:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
provision that people need um I I don't
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
understand why we're even debating it
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
like it needs to get figured out we're
 
01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
not going to figure it out no matter
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
what the bill is uh it's it's a this is
 
01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
a policy decision do we believe that
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
this is something that should be
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
supported because we've heard over and
 
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
over that that this is causing them
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
Financial Risk and you know when it's
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
your mother that needs the ambulance
 
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
you're going to be pretty upset if
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
there's no one there to show
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
up other
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
discussions represent L and
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
you I just wanted to just scan through
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
the bill text again real
 
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
quick uh so looking at the bill text
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
again it's not Medicare it's just
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so we do have some elderly
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
citizens who are on both but Medicaid is
 
01:07:16.269 --> 01:07:16.279 align:start position:0%
more on um on on a younger time um time
 
01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
because we have the people who are on
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid obviously there is overlap um
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
and obviously we do have quite a few
 
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
people who perhaps do have needs to be
 
01:07:27.789 --> 01:07:27.799 align:start position:0%
able to do some of this as well but this
 
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
is just Medicaid it's not Medicare so a
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
lot of our elderly family members are on
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
the Medicare as opposed to the Medicaid
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
and that's a federal issue so this is a
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
smaller wedge um it does look like um
 
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
there was a a fiscal note that has been
 
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
shown but it says that it's over a
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars General over a million
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
Federal and they don't know how much it
 
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
um so because there's just a lot of
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
uncertainty I so so I had uh moved to
 
01:07:57.069 --> 01:07:57.079 align:start position:0%
withdraw my motion of interim study so
 
01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
we can get some more information ahead
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
of our our 20 our meeting on March 20th
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
yes I'm withd drawing my second okay so
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
we will continue 156 at FN to March
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
20th uh just just for everyone's uh
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
awareness we're not planning to meet
 
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
next week so we'll be dealing with any
 
01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
bills after today uh on March 20th which
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
is the final day we can deal with them
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:53.950 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
okay again we're you know to accommodate
 
01:08:58.030 --> 01:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh the two members of the committee who
 
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
um who are trying to help out on an
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
important issue in Commerce we're trying
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
to uh you know jocky around a little bit
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
here uh representative Shapiro uh did
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about 1028 this
 
01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.430 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about 1028 this
time

01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:09:16.349 --> 01:09:16.359 align:start position:0%
yes and everybody should have an
 
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
amendment uh 09 63h that representative
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
Shapiro distributed
 
01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:27.709 align:start position:0%
Shapiro distributed
earlier

01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
so would you like to move move the yes I
 
01:09:35.789 --> 01:09:35.799 align:start position:0%
will move that we adopt amendment 0963
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
to House Bill
 
01:09:39.789 --> 01:09:39.799 align:start position:0%
1028 is there a
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
second representative Nagel seconds
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro would you like to
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes so this is a
 
01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
bill that was brought forth
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember the sponsor but it
 
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
was obviously brought forth on the on
 
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.990 align:start position:0%
was obviously brought forth on the on
the

01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
um by advocates for the developmental
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
disabilities Community who felt that the
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
statute that was currently in place
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
including the um definition of mental
 
01:10:11.149 --> 01:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
illness um which I think is you know
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
beyond this bill is a very flawed
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
definition but um that the definition um
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
um intellectual ual
 
01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.470 align:start position:0%
um intellectual ual
disabilities

01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
um that the me that the definition of
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
mental illnesses did not include people
 
01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.430 align:start position:0%
mental illnesses did not include people
with

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
intellectually intellectual disabilities
 
01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
if it was primarily caused by
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and so um
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
whatever the wording is seems to be that
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
the reality is is that sometimes um
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
people with intellectual disabilities or
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities are sometimes
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
denied um Mental Health Care by the
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
state system by New Hampshire hospital
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
by the mental health centers um because
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
they are simply told that this is
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
um this is a a developmental issue not a
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
mental illness issue and so this is an
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
attempt um the bill in itself is an
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
attempt to U make it so that people with
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
co-occurring disorders um whe whether
 
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
they have um an intellectual disability
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
or not if they have a mental illness
 
01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
that they will be eligible for treatment
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
through the state system of mental
 
01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.790 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
the the initial bill did two things um
 
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
on line 18 and 19 and 20 it said an
 
01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
individual shall not be determined
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
ineligible for services under this
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
chapter on the basis of co-occurrence of
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
mental illness and an intellectual
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
developmental disability and the
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that um that we're bringing
 
01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
today um leaves that in um the initial
 
01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
bill also takes out um
 
01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
in Roman numeral
 
01:12:31.629 --> 01:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
10 um Part B it removes intellectual
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
disability and in working with
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel um we both felt
 
01:12:40.629 --> 01:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
that that did not make sense because um
 
01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
it was initially put in there because
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
you wanted to be able to discern the
 
01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
difference between someone who had an
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability and mental
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
illness we didn't want people to assume
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
that everyone who had a disability was
 
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
also mental mentally ill so I think it
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
was initially put in there as a
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
protection for people and it didn't make
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
sense for us to take it out however
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
people um Disability Advocates felt like
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
this was often used um to um create an
 
01:13:12.189 --> 01:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
obstacle to people being getting mental
 
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
health care so my
 
01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:18.270 align:start position:0%
health care so my
Amendment

01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
um changes on line eight in the
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
amendment it's says instead of primarily
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
caused by epilepsy intellectual
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
disability um intoxication Etc it
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
says it does not include impairment
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
solely caused and we think that that is
 
01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
a a small change but one that
 
01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
clarifies um that we're talking about
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about cooccurring
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
disorders and we're saying that people
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
should be eligible for mental health
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
care um unless their the behavior or um
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
symptoms shown are solely um a solely
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
caused by um that disability so it's a
 
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
small change
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
um I think it satisfies some of the
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
people who brought the bill in the first
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
place um I think it clarifies things and
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
um I would urge you to adopt the
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative Nal you want to
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
speak to you make motion also sure um I
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
I this was a lesson in legislation for
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
me I've never been involved in so much
 
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
discussion based on the strike out of a
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
single word but it was it was it was it
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
was really important and impressive and
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
I have to say just viscerally just
 
01:14:45.629 --> 01:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
seeing that strikeout from the minute I
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
saw it really bothered me a lot part of
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
it is because I have a son with an
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability I have a cousin
 
01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
with an intellectual disability my wife
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
would say she has a husband with an
 
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability but anyway so um
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
she'll have
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
to you know I I think the reason why
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's excluded because historically
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
people looked at intellectual disability
 
01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
and mental illness as the same thing and
 
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
I think it was important that that be
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
excluded um I've dealt with people with
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities my entire life and um my
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
one of my papers that I I wrote back in
 
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
the 1990s was on full stroke depression
 
01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
and we were looking at the neural
 
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
physiology of that is this a separate
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
thing or reactive thing is it from the
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
the neurophysiology the stroke itself
 
01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
whatever but we always looked at them as
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
two separate things that we treat the
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
stroke here we do not deny your right to
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
have full treatment of your depression
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
is a separate thing and so to me they it
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
was important that we acknowledge the
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
comorbidity but that they're not the
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
same thing and it seemed to me when you
 
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
did that strike out you're removing it
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
that distinction with that said it
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
seemed seemed to me that everything that
 
01:15:56.189 --> 01:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
they wanted to accomplish with this bill
 
01:15:58.629 --> 01:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
was in the SEC the last paragraph and I
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
thought that was really important and I
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
just want to make one public statement
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
it really bothered me that this bill is
 
01:16:08.629 --> 01:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
even necessary um um um I I I don't
 
01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
understand how you could deny people
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
access to care for depression and
 
01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
disability is so common or other things
 
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
that they really deserve their they're
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
worthy of their own distinction and and
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
they need to be addressed as such so I
 
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
representative chapero yes I just in
 
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
case I wasn't clear enough the initial
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
bill struck out intellectual disability
 
01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
the the amendment puts it back in but
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
says solely caused by it and I I do want
 
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
to make one comment there was a lot of
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
very compelling
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
testimony unfortunately I think that
 
01:16:50.629 --> 01:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
even with this bill um it may it may
 
01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
reduce one obstacle um um but certainly
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
people with intellectual disabilities or
 
01:16:58.629 --> 01:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities aren't the
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
only people waiting on long list to get
 
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
Services um we know that the emergency
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
room boarding problem is a problem maybe
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's more of a problem for people with
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities but it's it's
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
a problem for children it's a problem
 
01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:17.320 align:start position:0%
for adults and um I don't s this is one
 
01:17:19.629 --> 01:17:19.639 align:start position:0%
thing that we can do to to maybe ease
 
01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
the situation for some people but I
 
01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
don't think we should fool ourselves
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
into thinking it's going to solve the
 
01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.430 align:start position:0%
into thinking it's going to solve the
whole

01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
problem representative Lon um thank you
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I think that this is a
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
really interesting and potentially good
 
01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
way to go um it's something that I
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
probably would want to just sort of um
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
have a couple minutes to think about um
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
I I'm thinking it looks like we may be
 
01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
getting our friends back from uh when we
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
l from Commerce um and I know that we've
 
01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
been trying to manage what we're doing
 
01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:53.560 align:start position:0%
with all of that too um so I didn't know
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
if it' be possible for us maybe to have
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
um have a caucus just to be able to
 
01:18:00.629 --> 01:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
discuss it and just figure out time
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
frame wise as well because I think that
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
this um probably is an important one to
 
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody can be on the
 
01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
same page about because this definition
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
of mental illness is pretty significant
 
01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
um so either if we did it that way or if
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
we withdrew it and got back to 1712
 
01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
because I've heard back from LS that we
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
can't actually change that date because
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
it's in chapter law not in statutes um
 
01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
so I didn't know it would make sense to
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
withdraw that maybe go through 1712 and
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
then take a break in which we could
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
caucus and then everybody could expect
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
how much time they could have to use the
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
facilities and whatnot um before we're
 
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
there although then again we have
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
everybody back too so I'm not sure what
 
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
the best way to go forward is I've just
 
01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:41.560 align:start position:0%
been trying to trying to work on the Fly
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
here together today and uh and
 
01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
accommodate everything but I would like
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
to get have a chance to sort of wrap my
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
head around this change from primarily
 
01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:50.950 align:start position:0%
head around this change from primarily
to

01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
solely okay well we can um as I
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
understand it even though it's on the
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
floor we could I think we can continue
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
it till we don't need to withdraw it
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
where we're going to continue it today I
 
01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.149 align:start position:0%
where we're going to continue it today I
don't

01:19:03.149 --> 01:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
believe I don't believe um I I'm not
 
01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure I'm not sure exactly
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
what the rest process I don't know if
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
maybe we just want to take um take a
 
01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
caucus until 5 or 10 after just to give
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
people a chance to use the restroom and
 
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
whatnot and discuss it a little bit and
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
we also were trying to make sure that we
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
had time to get you guys back in because
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
we've done just about as much business
 
01:19:26.669 --> 01:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
as we could without you thank you thank
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
you all right so okay why don't we do
 
01:19:31.709 --> 01:19:31.719 align:start position:0%
that then why don't we recess uh for
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
what are you proposing 20 minutes uh
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
yeah um probably until um 11:10 by 20
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
minutes 22 minutes right we'll take a
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
relatively brief recess we'll
 
01:19:44.669 --> 01:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
Republicans will be be having a caucus
 
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
in the committee office and um anyone
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
else who needs to take care of anything
 
01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
in the meantime please feel free to do
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.760 --> 01:44:17.669 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%

wish to speak to your motion um yes
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I this is a
 
01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
bill which would take basically the um
 
01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
informed consent guidelines that are
 
01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
already in the AMA requirements and put
 
01:50:22.109 --> 01:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
it in statute one of the areas that we
 
01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
have challenges around is
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
enforceability um whether that's whether
 
01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
that's swearing somebody in to testify
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
when there's no enforceability if you're
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
not a if if you can't do anything if
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
nobody tells you if somebody tells you
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
something that's not the truth whether
 
01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
it is any of other statutes that may or
 
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
may not be followed but it's one thing
 
01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
when you have if by putting this into
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
the law there would be another reason to
 
01:50:47.950 --> 01:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that any of the providers who
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
aren't following through on informed
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
consent are actually doing this uh this
 
01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
is one of those important areas where
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
there is a distinction between in
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
provider-based informed consent and
 
01:50:59.790 --> 01:50:59.800 align:start position:0%
patient based informed consent and this
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
makes sure that the patients have to be
 
01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion um that's been a
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
bit of a gray area in New Hampshire
 
01:51:07.629 --> 01:51:07.639 align:start position:0%
where some people say that it's only
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
based off of what a doctor wants you to
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
know but that leaves a lot of liability
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
for our for our providers if we get this
 
01:51:15.629 --> 01:51:15.639 align:start position:0%
into statute and they're clearly
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
following not only AMA guidelines for
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
Physicians but also it's in the state
 
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
law that provides a lot of protection
 
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679 align:start position:0%
for them if somebody says that the
 
01:51:26.229 --> 01:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
correct informed consent was not
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
followed because it just provides more
 
01:51:30.069 --> 01:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
clarity by putting there I know some
 
01:51:32.109 --> 01:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
people would want to expand this to
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
other provider types as well and I
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
recognize that but you can't really just
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
take the AMA guidelines for Physicians
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
and then give that to everybody else
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
that would need to take a a little bit
 
01:51:43.870 --> 01:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
more nuanced look and that's something
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
that I know I personally am interested
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
in doing over time because informed
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
consent is vital you can't have a
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
patient patient be an active participant
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
in their healthare and their recovery if
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
they truly don't know what they're doing
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
and why um and so I'd like to continue
 
01:52:00.669 --> 01:52:00.679 align:start position:0%
moving towards this uh more outlined
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
more collaborative process so that we
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
can make sure that providers and
 
01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
patients are working together to improve
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
health other
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Nagel thank
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I appreciate everything
 
01:52:16.069 --> 01:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
that you've done on this bill and all
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
the discussions that it's led to and I
 
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
we're too very different hats on this
 
01:52:24.669 --> 01:52:24.679 align:start position:0%
bill um the one hat is a Doctor Who's
 
01:52:27.310 --> 01:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
got way too many people in my exam room
 
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
right now telling me what to do when I
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
don't even know who I'm treating anymore
 
01:52:33.069 --> 01:52:33.079 align:start position:0%
which is kind of really sad statement
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
and it just seems to me that this is yet
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
another intrusion on on that
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
relationship and and especially
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
considering everything in this bill
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
already exists I already have to do all
 
01:52:44.910 --> 01:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
this I have to take a class every year
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
that reinforces I got to do all this at
 
01:52:50.069 --> 01:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
the same point um we are witnessing a
 
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
corporate takeover Health Care before
 
01:52:54.750 --> 01:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
our very eyes and I'm not sure that this
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
is so much directed as me the doctor and
 
01:52:58.830 --> 01:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
my patient as I am at the corporate
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
provider so the one side of me is really
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
violently opposed to this bill the other
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
side of me is violently in supportive of
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
this bill which means that I guess I'm
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
schizophrenic so um I I I'm probably
 
01:53:13.709 --> 01:53:13.719 align:start position:0%
going to not support it but I really
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and what I really like
 
01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
what you said um representative was I
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
think this does need to lead to a lot
 
01:53:22.270 --> 01:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
broader discussion on a lot of levels
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate other discussion
 
01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:28.790 align:start position:0%
appreciate other discussion
representative

01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr
 
01:53:33.629 --> 01:53:33.639 align:start position:0%
chair I'm of the mindset I think also
 
01:53:35.589 --> 01:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
with representative Nagel the intent of
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
the spill I trly truly support um I
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
think I'm really concerned about how
 
01:53:42.669 --> 01:53:42.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to impact the medical
 
01:53:44.430 --> 01:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
community and also the care for patients
 
01:53:49.149 --> 01:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
we have Physicians that are today buried
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
in paperwork
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
and my concern is that we're adding
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
another layer of paperwork to it so I
 
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
don't know what impact this is going to
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
have on the ability of the provider to
 
01:54:01.069 --> 01:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
have enough time to see the patient
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
versus take care of all the paperwork so
 
01:54:05.629 --> 01:54:05.639 align:start position:0%
I'd rather go to interim study and talk
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
about this I think it has a lot of
 
01:54:08.589 --> 01:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
merits but I'd like to be sure what what
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
we're doing actually has been thought
 
01:54:12.430 --> 01:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
through and we hear from the medical
 
01:54:15.310 --> 01:54:15.320 align:start position:0%
community how this may impact them so
 
01:54:17.149 --> 01:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where I'm coming down but
 
01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
I do want to say thank you to the
 
01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing to our
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
attention representative Mel yeah I just
 
01:54:24.510 --> 01:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify what you just said I
 
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
don't really think it's going to add to
 
01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
the paperwork at all I I I mean when I
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
started out you you had talked about
 
01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
patient centered informed consents
 
01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
that's what I created I've written at
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
least 30 of them and now I'm told I'm
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
not allowed to do that that the risk
 
01:54:41.550 --> 01:54:41.560 align:start position:0%
management people have to rate the
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
informed consent for me and so when I re
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
it was funny after we had our hearing on
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
this I went and looked at the informed
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
consent patients were signning in the O
 
01:54:52.069 --> 01:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
before I'm about to do a procedure and
 
01:54:53.709 --> 01:54:53.719 align:start position:0%
it was a patient i' had known for a long
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
time and I looked at her and I said did
 
01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
you read this and she goes no and I go
 
01:54:58.990 --> 01:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
you know what neither have I let's read
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
it together when we read it I go I'm not
 
01:55:03.310 --> 01:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
signing this are you and she goes no and
 
01:55:06.109 --> 01:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
I I it really actually led to a big
 
01:55:08.350 --> 01:55:08.360 align:start position:0%
discussion of trying to take this back
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
from the risk management people to do
 
01:55:12.189 --> 01:55:12.199 align:start position:0%
exactly what you just said so that's why
 
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
this is really important but as far as
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
paperwork it is so easy now I just sign
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
they sign nobody even looks at it and I
 
01:55:21.229 --> 01:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
think that's really tragic
 
01:55:24.069 --> 01:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
other discussion representative
 
01:55:27.629 --> 01:55:27.639 align:start position:0%
Palmer so I think that the concern I
 
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
have is um a lot of what Dr Nagel and
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
and I mean representative Nagel and
 
01:55:36.510 --> 01:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant said um which is
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's clearly a very important issue um
 
01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
but for example in um so on on line 15
 
01:55:45.149 --> 01:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
where it says that it says the
 
01:55:46.750 --> 01:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
Physicians shall include information
 
01:55:49.229 --> 01:55:49.239 align:start position:0%
about the burdens risks and expected
 
01:55:51.149 --> 01:55:51.159 align:start position:0%
benefit it's of all options including
 
01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
foregoing treatment and um the so I am
 
01:55:59.069 --> 01:55:59.079 align:start position:0%
concerned that well who's
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
deciding that and and how do I document
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
that every time I make a decision about
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
a patient uh so for example I mean I
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
might be just simply choosing an an
 
01:56:12.910 --> 01:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
antibiotic for a patient but now do I
 
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
have to document exactly why I picked
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
that one I mean usually there is some
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
indication of why because it's the
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
correct one for that diagnosis but I
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
I again I guess what I'm saying is I
 
01:56:28.030 --> 01:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
would support what representative merch
 
01:56:29.390 --> 01:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
said which would be interim study to
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not creating a
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
monster that's going to make you know my
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
life and everybody else is really
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
difficult at a time when we can't
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
recruit anybody I I mean I'm hoping to
 
01:56:40.589 --> 01:56:40.599 align:start position:0%
retire at the end of this year but I'm
 
01:56:42.750 --> 01:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be able to and one
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
of the one of the reasons is the
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
paperwork burden and I don't want to
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
increase it I want to make sure that
 
01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:50.069 align:start position:0%
increase it I want to make sure that
this

01:56:50.069 --> 01:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know if this could be done in a way
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
where we're streamlining things so that
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's really clear exactly
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
what needs to be there that would be
 
01:57:00.069 --> 01:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
great but I'm not right now I'm
 
01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable representative
 
01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you for that pres
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
Palmer as an option to interim study
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
this is not an early Bill correct it is
 
01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
not so if rep and lon's willing to sit
 
01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
down with myself and some other folks
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
and Hammer out something that's more
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
logical that based fund medical
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
community and so forth I think that may
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
be another way to get to the same thing
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
without holding it up complet of this
 
01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
legislative cycle representative L on
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
that would work for me we do still have
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
another two weeks um I I I think that
 
01:57:34.030 --> 01:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
just we've worked well together sort of
 
01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
offline I don't think we need a
 
01:57:36.669 --> 01:57:36.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we can just sort of
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
discuss this we can but i' encourage us
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
to have both represent Nel and
 
01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer part of that
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
conversation because they come from the
 
01:57:46.510 --> 01:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
medical community more than I do I think
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
the uh input from them would be truly
 
01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:51.069 align:start position:0%
the uh input from them would be truly
valuable

01:57:51.069 --> 01:57:51.079 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative Nel I'm sorry that
 
01:57:54.669 --> 01:57:54.679 align:start position:0%
representative kushman's not here to
 
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
answer this but my understanding and I I
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
did look through the AMA guide this is
 
01:58:01.149 --> 01:58:01.159 align:start position:0%
directly from the AMA guides there's
 
01:58:02.589 --> 01:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that we're not supposed
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
to already be doing um I mean the way I
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
do it maybe I should tell everybody else
 
01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
how to do this but I create an informed
 
01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
consent that's part of my entire process
 
01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
so when I meet with the person tell them
 
01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
what I want to do what I don't want to
 
01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
do that inform what I created was part
 
01:58:20.069 --> 01:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
of that whole discussion
 
01:58:21.950 --> 01:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
so when it comes time to sign it they
 
01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
already know what they're signing
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
because we already talked about it um I
 
01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that happens but this
 
01:58:30.030 --> 01:58:30.040 align:start position:0%
is what I'm already supposed to do
 
01:58:33.390 --> 01:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing new here um and and and
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
40 years ago my dad informed me the most
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
common reason doctors are suit is
 
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
failure to get informed consent and um
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
so 40 years ago he taught me to do
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
everything that's in this bill and
 
01:58:46.669 --> 01:58:46.679 align:start position:0%
that's why I struggle with voting
 
01:58:50.229 --> 01:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
against it um but it's what I have
 
01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:51.800 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
01:58:54.189 --> 01:58:54.199 align:start position:0%
chair as I listen to what you're saying
 
01:58:56.069 --> 01:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
representa Nel if it's already in the
 
01:58:58.709 --> 01:58:58.719 align:start position:0%
AMA guidelines the challenge with
 
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines are exactly that they're
 
01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines not statute or requirement so
 
01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
maybe by simply making this bill saying
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
that the positions to follow ma ma mama
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
guidelines will be sufficient because at
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
that point in time it then requires them
 
01:59:16.229 --> 01:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
to follow the guidelines versus putting
 
01:59:18.149 --> 01:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
actually in statute I just throwing it
 
01:59:20.109 --> 01:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
out there representative
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
profile uh thank you Mr chairman so I I
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
I have concerns about that approach I
 
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
have concerns whenever we put something
 
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
in statute that references an external
 
01:59:33.550 --> 01:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
organization whose standards could very
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
well change um we we are then in essence
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
delegating legislative authority to an
 
01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
organization that is not only Not
 
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
Elected uh by citizens of New Hampshire
 
01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
they may not even be from New Hampshire
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
at all so I I would just I would um urge
 
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
caution in taking that approach
 
01:59:56.189 --> 01:59:56.199 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel did I see your hand
 
01:59:58.149 --> 01:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
up I guess so yeah I I just wanted to
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
say that what representative Merchant
 
02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
said is already in rules um it's not in
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
statute but it is in rules yeah my
 
02:00:07.709 --> 02:00:07.719 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for all this
 
02:00:12.510 --> 02:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
conversation and this Insight um I think
 
02:00:14.229 --> 02:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
that the difference between having the
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
need to follow AMA guidelines and rules
 
02:00:18.350 --> 02:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
that allows the medical board to look
 
02:00:20.310 --> 02:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
and see well actually what you're doing
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
is consistent with where the ma AMA is
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
headed when I was a device analyst we
 
02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
had the guidelines from all the
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
different medical societies and you know
 
02:00:30.149 --> 02:00:30.159 align:start position:0%
it's sort of the Baseline to be able to
 
02:00:32.830 --> 02:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
have those guidelines but sometimes
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
something that was emerging in somebody
 
02:00:36.149 --> 02:00:36.159 align:start position:0%
that you were doing actually ended up
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
contradicting the guidelines because
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
there was emerging evidence but it yet
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't yet the fully adopted practice um
 
02:00:44.589 --> 02:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
and so that's why I think the idea of
 
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
sort of airlifting one of these areas
 
02:00:49.069 --> 02:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
that is so crucial to this care specific
 
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
spefically out of a guideline that's
 
02:00:52.669 --> 02:00:52.679 align:start position:0%
already been vetted and sort of freeze
 
02:00:55.229 --> 02:00:55.239 align:start position:0%
that in time and freeze that in statute
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
and have it so that it's a shell instead
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
of a May um I think makes sense in areas
 
02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
like this especially ones where where
 
02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
you see that it should be such General
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
such General um action something that we
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
should be doing um if if we're not able
 
02:01:11.470 --> 02:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
to get to an agreement on a to pass
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
today I'd be happy to pull that back
 
02:01:16.270 --> 02:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
withdraw that and see what we can get to
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
for the 20th so that perhaps we can come
 
02:01:18.719 --> 02:01:19.629 align:start position:0%
for the 20th so that perhaps we can come
out

02:01:19.629 --> 02:01:19.639 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
have more of our bills on the consent
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
calendar as opposed to needing to debate
 
02:01:25.709 --> 02:01:25.719 align:start position:0%
them on the floor if uh with by spending
 
02:01:26.910 --> 02:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit more time we could get
 
02:01:29.629 --> 02:01:29.639 align:start position:0%
there so with that I'll withdraw my
 
02:01:32.189 --> 02:01:32.199 align:start position:0%
motion okay representative Missour did
 
02:01:33.550 --> 02:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
you second
 
02:01:37.470 --> 02:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
that okay are you withdrawing in a
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
second okay that's just a
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
question all right so the motion has
 
02:01:45.629 --> 02:01:45.639 align:start position:0%
been withdrawn and we will continue that
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
along with 1568 to March 20th
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay um Mr chairman for May yes
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
represent Merchant this will be not an
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
official subcommittee this will be an ad
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
hoc committee so we can via we can
 
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
communicate via Zoom informal effort by
 
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
informal effort right so we can utilize
 
02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:05.069 align:start position:0%
informal effort right so we can utilize
the

02:02:05.069 --> 02:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:07.149 --> 02:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
technology versus meeting a person
 
02:02:08.910 --> 02:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
correct sure representative
 
02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:10.430 align:start position:0%
correct sure representative
representative

02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman I'm not
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
sure I understand this but I hope that
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
when there's further discussions um that
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
02:02:25.069 --> 02:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
um on page one line 24 where it talks
 
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
about patients rights is that an
 
02:02:30.189 --> 02:02:30.199 align:start position:0%
addition to the patients rights that
 
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
already exist is it completely different
 
02:02:34.430 --> 02:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
patients rights and does it make sense
 
02:02:36.910 --> 02:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
to have patients rights in more than one
 
02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
place so I'm not really asking for
 
02:02:42.189 --> 02:02:42.199 align:start position:0%
anything right now but I'm just hoping
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
that that'll be part of the discussion
 
02:02:46.109 --> 02:02:46.119 align:start position:0%
uh that's actually a really important
 
02:02:47.790 --> 02:02:47.800 align:start position:0%
point the patients Bill of Rights is not
 
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
binding on provider it's binding on
 
02:02:53.229 --> 02:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
facilities so it wouldn't be appropriate
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
to have this in the patients Bill of
 
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
Rights because that that's about the
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
facilities not the provider themselves
 
02:03:00.430 --> 02:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
maybe it shouldn't be called patients
 
02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
rights maybe it should be if if you can
 
02:03:05.950 --> 02:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to consider other words
 
02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
that you have but the right to have
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
informed consent I think is pretty
 
02:03:13.229 --> 02:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
fundamental but I'd be happy to discuss
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
that offline as our legislative friends
 
02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:17.679 align:start position:0%
in our adhoc type way okay thank you
 
02:03:20.109 --> 02:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
I'll think about it thank you
 
02:03:23.870 --> 02:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on HB
 
02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
1280 all right moving on uh next up is
 
02:03:29.950 --> 02:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
HB 1347 representative cofal do you want
 
02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
to make a motion uh yes I move interim
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
study on House Bill 1347 okay I'll
 
02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
second that uh would you like to speak
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
to your motion um sure so I I think that
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
this bill by the sponsor's own admission
 
02:03:47.350 --> 02:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
was not ready for prime time it doesn't
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
actually um ptain or it wasn't intended
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
to pertain to the refugee resettlement
 
02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
program um there are things uh yeah it's
 
02:03:59.629 --> 02:03:59.639 align:start position:0%
just it was not um it was not drafted to
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
align with his
 
02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
intent having said that I think we have
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
all heard concerns about um veterans who
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
are being displaced from Services people
 
02:04:13.470 --> 02:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
who are um who are not necessarily
 
02:04:15.549 --> 02:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
getting the services they need not in
 
02:04:18.069 --> 02:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh but we've heard stories
 
02:04:19.709 --> 02:04:19.719 align:start position:0%
from other states so I think that there
 
02:04:22.109 --> 02:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
is a legitimate question that needs to
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
be uh discussed and investigated and so
 
02:04:27.950 --> 02:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
for that reason I would move inm study
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:33.229 align:start position:0%
thank you other
discussions

02:04:33.229 --> 02:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
02:04:35.470 --> 02:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
see I was just gonna say that sounds
 
02:04:37.629 --> 02:04:37.639 align:start position:0%
very reasonable and I'll vote in favor
 
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
of that okay representative
 
02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:43.470 align:start position:0%
of that okay representative
Shapero

02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
Shapero
 
02:04:46.549 --> 02:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
um I agree that this would this would be
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
an a an acceptable outcome but I'm going
 
02:04:52.669 --> 02:04:52.679 align:start position:0%
to vote against it in hopes that um it
 
02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
can be ited I think that um as was said
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
by the previous speaker the um the the
 
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor themselves said that the bill
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
was poorly written and didn't align with
 
02:05:10.950 --> 02:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
his intent um and I would support
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
interim study if the if the intent that
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
was talked about was really a broad
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
discussion about immigration and how
 
02:05:21.390 --> 02:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
immigration affects New Hampshire both
 
02:05:25.549 --> 02:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
the incredible benefits it brings and
 
02:05:28.709 --> 02:05:28.719 align:start position:0%
the problems that it brings and how we
 
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:35.950 --> 02:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
um you know immigration work for New
 
02:05:39.629 --> 02:05:39.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I I just read in in a
 
02:05:41.709 --> 02:05:41.719 align:start position:0%
business magazine this morning before I
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
came that um while the population of New
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is increasing um that that the
 
02:05:49.199 --> 02:05:50.709 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is increasing um that that the
population

02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:50.719 align:start position:0%
population
 
02:05:56.109 --> 02:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
increase from 2010 to current half of
 
02:05:59.950 --> 02:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
that population increase um is from
 
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
International International immigration
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
and um I
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
think so unfortunately to me because I
 
02:06:11.310 --> 02:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
would like to defer to representative
 
02:06:13.629 --> 02:06:13.639 align:start position:0%
Edwards the prime sponsor unfortunately
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
to me all the conversation after it was
 
02:06:18.669 --> 02:06:18.679 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that the bill was not as a
 
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
should be was about how to um make sure
 
02:06:27.549 --> 02:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
that immigrants don't cut in line and
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't first of all I don't think
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
that happens in New Hampshire second of
 
02:06:37.470 --> 02:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
all I think there are federal laws about
 
02:06:42.189 --> 02:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
um for example for Medicaid about um
 
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
whether people in certain categories of
 
02:06:48.669 --> 02:06:48.679 align:start position:0%
um non-citizen status have to be given
 
02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or have to be elig not have to
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
be given have to be eligible so I think
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
the discussion after the acknowledgment
 
02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
that this was not a well-written bill
 
02:07:03.149 --> 02:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
was all leading to um a future bill that
 
02:07:06.189 --> 02:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
would be divisive in my in my mind and
 
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
so um I would rather vote for itl but I
 
02:07:12.549 --> 02:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
understand if people would vote for um
 
02:07:16.270 --> 02:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
interim study um and the discussion will
 
02:07:19.069 --> 02:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
be what it is if that happens
 
02:07:22.149 --> 02:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none okay the motion
 
02:07:27.629 --> 02:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
is interim study on hb1

speak to your motion yes thank
 
02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
you this is a very
 
02:09:59.109 --> 02:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
interesting um part of the bill um that
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to be discussing here um and
 
02:10:05.189 --> 02:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
I just want to preface it by saying that
 
02:10:07.069 --> 02:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
I think honest people can disagree on
 
02:10:10.109 --> 02:10:10.119 align:start position:0%
this issue and I totally understand
 
02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
where the people who disagree with me on
 
02:10:13.549 --> 02:10:13.559 align:start position:0%
this are coming from and I don't blame
 
02:10:17.310 --> 02:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
them one bit um however that being said
 
02:10:18.910 --> 02:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to still
 
02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
the position I'm making um and um so to
 
02:10:26.549 --> 02:10:26.559 align:start position:0%
start off there this bill I really see
 
02:10:30.270 --> 02:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
it as as two parts um there is the first
 
02:10:34.750 --> 02:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
part which allows for baby boxes and
 
02:10:37.069 --> 02:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
also increasing the number of days that
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
an individual can drop off a baby at a
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
baby box for example from seven to uh 61
 
02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
days I believe the second part of the
 
02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
bill is in add added exclusionary clause
 
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
um that I I think is just a bridge too
 
02:10:57.149 --> 02:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
far for me personally there is already
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
um immunity in the current statute that
 
02:11:04.109 --> 02:11:04.119 align:start position:0%
allows for parents to drop off their
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
baby and not have to fear prosecution
 
02:11:09.549 --> 02:11:09.559 align:start position:0%
for neglect in that in that way of
 
02:11:12.189 --> 02:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
dropping off the baby um but what this
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
exclusionary clause would do is that if
 
02:11:20.030 --> 02:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
a parent for example were to drop off a
 
02:11:23.310 --> 02:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
baby that had been severely
 
02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
intentionally abused in ways that we can
 
02:11:28.270 --> 02:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
use our imagination but I'm not going to
 
02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:29.950 align:start position:0%
use our imagination but I'm not going to
say

02:11:29.950 --> 02:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:11:34.270 --> 02:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
here the evidence that the state would
 
02:11:37.830 --> 02:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
have of that abuse would be on that
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
child and it's likely that there would
 
02:11:42.430 --> 02:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
be no other
 
02:11:46.549 --> 02:11:46.559 align:start position:0%
way for law enforcement to get other
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
evidence of the abuse so so that the the
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
abuse is the evidence is strictly on
 
02:11:54.669 --> 02:11:54.679 align:start position:0%
that child and this exclusionary clause
 
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
would tie the hands of law enforcement
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
from being able
 
02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
to prosecute or at least use the
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
evidence found on the child in a
 
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
prosecutor prosecutorial
 
02:12:08.669 --> 02:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
manner um
 
02:12:11.069 --> 02:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
and I know people don't always like
 
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
analogies as much as I do but I love
 
02:12:14.669 --> 02:12:14.679 align:start position:0%
analogy so I'm going to use an analogy
 
02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
here just to sort of I think wrap help
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
wrap our heads around what we're
 
02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
actually doing um I think many of us
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
have heard of the uh the moral conundrum
 
02:12:26.830 --> 02:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
if you are a conductor on a train and
 
02:12:27.950 --> 02:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
you're going down the track and you
 
02:12:30.990 --> 02:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
can't stop and you see five people tied
 
02:12:34.030 --> 02:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
to the track um but you have the option
 
02:12:36.510 --> 02:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
of you know cranking the you know
 
02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
cranking the levers and switching to a
 
02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
track that only has three people tied to
 
02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
it which do you
 
02:12:44.830 --> 02:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
choose um and that might be easy if all
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
else is being equal um but but what
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
happens if the five people are really
 
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
elderly and the three people are babies
 
02:12:55.390 --> 02:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
or what if the five people are convicted
 
02:12:58.950 --> 02:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
convicts and the three are uh known
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
Heroes to the community and you could
 
02:13:02.549 --> 02:13:02.559 align:start position:0%
keep playing these games the point is is
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
it's a very difficult conundrum and
 
02:13:06.669 --> 02:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
people have debated these sorts of
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
things for a long time and I see that as
 
02:13:12.430 --> 02:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
what's happening in this exclusionary
 
02:13:16.830 --> 02:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
clause um we are deciding which babies
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
um we should say and which we should
 
02:13:21.149 --> 02:13:21.159 align:start position:0%
throw under the bus and that's a very
 
02:13:23.109 --> 02:13:23.119 align:start position:0%
difficult decision and and I don't I
 
02:13:24.750 --> 02:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
don't blame anybody for taking the
 
02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
opposite position I am but what's
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
happening here is that we are
 
02:13:32.950 --> 02:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
potentially letting uh with if this
 
02:13:34.870 --> 02:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
exclusionary clause days were
 
02:13:38.669 --> 02:13:38.679 align:start position:0%
potentially letting intentional abusers
 
02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
get away with their crimes so that they
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
can commit more
 
02:13:45.910 --> 02:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
crimes in the hopes that
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
by by doing that that there will be
 
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
other parents who will feel more secure
 
02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
in dropping off their babies without
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
fear of legal
 
02:14:00.910 --> 02:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
repercussions and uh there's been a lot
 
02:14:03.910 --> 02:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
of talk about who those parents might be
 
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
um a lot of parents you know they're
 
02:14:09.069 --> 02:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
addicted to drugs and they just do not
 
02:14:11.390 --> 02:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
have the wherewithal to take care of
 
02:14:13.430 --> 02:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
their children and after a few days of
 
02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
neglect they come to their senses thank
 
02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
God that they need to they need to drop
 
02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
off their baby and unfortunately there
 
02:14:25.790 --> 02:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
has been there are concerns that law
 
02:14:28.430 --> 02:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement will then use that
 
02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
as as uh evidence to go prosecute them
 
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
for drug crimes okay and I'm against
 
02:14:38.149 --> 02:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
that I have I have been openly against
 
02:14:40.510 --> 02:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
the War on Drugs my entire life and I
 
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
don't like the idea of that
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
happening however the thought of a baby
 
02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
being in the care
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
of a parent who is addicted to drugs and
 
02:14:55.470 --> 02:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
is not capable of taking care of their
 
02:14:58.109 --> 02:14:58.119 align:start position:0%
child that's a bad thought but it's not
 
02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
as bad as a child being in the care of
 
02:15:04.270 --> 02:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
somebody who is intentionally abusing
 
02:15:06.030 --> 02:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
children that to me is a far worse
 
02:15:07.950 --> 02:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
thought once again we're playing the
 
02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
conductor con conundrum here ultimately
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
what it comes down to I see it is this
 
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
and that is there's a bad guy here
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
somebody is the bad
 
02:15:23.549 --> 02:15:23.559 align:start position:0%
guy we are with B with baby boxes and
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
allowing parents to drop their children
 
02:15:28.510 --> 02:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
off we are that's a pretty sweet deal
 
02:15:30.910 --> 02:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
but by adding this exclusionary clause
 
02:15:33.109 --> 02:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is we're sweetening an
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
already Sweet Deal we're saying not only
 
02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
can you be a terrible parent but we're
 
02:15:41.109 --> 02:15:41.119 align:start position:0%
gonna we're g to just look away from
 
02:15:45.310 --> 02:15:45.320 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting you for uh for your misdeeds
 
02:15:48.430 --> 02:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
and when we do that when we
 
02:15:51.790 --> 02:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
when we Sherk our law enforcement job we
 
02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
become the bad guy and the way I see it
 
02:15:55.199 --> 02:15:56.229 align:start position:0%
become the bad guy and the way I see it
is

02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
that if we you know I would rather the
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
parents be the bad guys as opposed to us
 
02:16:04.350 --> 02:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
being the Bad Guys by shering our
 
02:16:06.910 --> 02:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility and
 
02:16:10.030 --> 02:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
um well I'm sure there will be other
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
people that have some things to say and
 
02:16:13.310 --> 02:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
I may have to chime in again but
 
02:16:15.870 --> 02:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately um I'm not prepared to let
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
the state be the bad guys um I think
 
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
that oh and the last thing I'll say is
 
02:16:24.069 --> 02:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
that when we fail to do our job uh when
 
02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement has their hands ties in
 
02:16:30.589 --> 02:16:30.599 align:start position:0%
this regard it often will encourage more
 
02:16:30.599 --> 02:16:33.549 align:start position:0%
this regard it often will encourage more
lawlessness

02:16:33.549 --> 02:16:33.559 align:start position:0%
lawlessness
 
02:16:36.429 --> 02:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
and and I think that that's that's just
 
02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
an unintended consequence I understand I
 
02:16:40.429 --> 02:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
really do understand where the people
 
02:16:41.709 --> 02:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
are coming from that support the
 
02:16:43.070 --> 02:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
exclusionary clause but I think there
 
02:16:44.750 --> 02:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
are going to be unintended consequences
 
02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
we put in put that in there and I for
 
02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:49.190 align:start position:0%
we put in put that in there and I for
one

02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:16:52.030 --> 02:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
cannot put my stamp of approval on that
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
so much so that I happen to like the
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
rest of the bill but if that
 
02:16:57.549 --> 02:16:57.559 align:start position:0%
exclusionary clause is in there I will
 
02:16:59.910 --> 02:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
not be able to support the bill if if it
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
stays so that's why I've offered an
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
amendment that will help to get rid of
 
02:17:05.230 --> 02:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
that exclusionary clause thank you for
 
02:17:06.750 --> 02:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
listening to me for so long
 
02:17:08.910 --> 02:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
02:17:10.429 --> 02:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for that and
 
02:17:13.389 --> 02:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative zth King for
 
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
following through on what you see as
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
your moral obligation to reduce harm I
 
02:17:21.910 --> 02:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
see this essentially as a death penalty
 
02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
bill um you have the potential that
 
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
children who are not surrendered
 
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
otherwise may be killed by their parents
 
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
and that's always a hard decision to
 
02:17:38.429 --> 02:17:38.439 align:start position:0%
figure out where you are trying to
 
02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
potentially let somebody who is a
 
02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
monster not have appropriate punishment
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
for them if you look at some my mind
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
also went to those Deep Dark Places
 
02:17:53.230 --> 02:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
about what somebody may do um I was in a
 
02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
girl Scot Troop that had uh one of the
 
02:17:57.150 --> 02:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
first women prosecute somebody for D on
 
02:17:59.549 --> 02:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
here um judged and a lot of the ones
 
02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
that literally I know the people that
 
02:18:03.309 --> 02:18:03.319 align:start position:0%
are in the Forensic Files shows and I
 
02:18:06.589 --> 02:18:06.599 align:start position:0%
watch too many of them so monsters exist
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of people that because
 
02:18:11.469 --> 02:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
of circumstances act like Monsters as
 
02:18:13.230 --> 02:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
well but if they were given a chance
 
02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:17.599 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be a monster um I I'm not
 
02:18:20.190 --> 02:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
convinced that by having this but not
 
02:18:22.669 --> 02:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
having the exclusionary rule you'd still
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
have those monsters who may be serly
 
02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
abusing children still forfeiting those
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
children so I'm not sure that those
 
02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
children would be saved even by passing
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
this without the exclusionary rule but
 
02:18:39.389 --> 02:18:39.399 align:start position:0%
what I do know is that people who are um
 
02:18:41.950 --> 02:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
on the wrong side of the law they know
 
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
what happens they know through the gra
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
Vine what happens when somebody tries to
 
02:18:49.790 --> 02:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing and then gets
 
02:18:52.709 --> 02:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
popped for something IR related to it
 
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
I'm worried that if we don't have this
 
02:18:56.709 --> 02:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
exclusionary law we're having the death
 
02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
penalty for kids for parents who are
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
just so messed up that they're so afraid
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
of what's going to happen that they kill
 
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
their child instead of surrender them
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
and I recognize we may let some monsters
 
02:19:14.589 --> 02:19:14.599 align:start position:0%
get away with horrible things but to me
 
02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
the more run-of-the-mill situation where
 
02:19:18.270 --> 02:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
somebody by circumstance dance acts like
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
a monster is a lot more pressing and
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
something that we have the ability to do
 
02:19:25.669 --> 02:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
something about um I appreciate where
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
you're coming from and I think that you
 
02:19:30.429 --> 02:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
know and I I apologize for not not
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
really crystallizing that I really see
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
this as a death penalty situation before
 
02:19:36.589 --> 02:19:36.599 align:start position:0%
I apologize for not discussing that with
 
02:19:37.990 --> 02:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
you before because until you were
 
02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
discussing this I didn't realize that
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
really what we're doing is we're
 
02:19:44.110 --> 02:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
deciding we're deciding when the death
 
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
penalty is appropriate because I see
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
that that is the other option for a lot
 
02:19:48.990 --> 02:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
of these children that aren't
 
02:19:52.590 --> 02:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
surrendered and to me I appreciate the
 
02:19:54.990 --> 02:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
intent behind removing the exclusionary
 
02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
but I I really think that we need it in
 
02:19:59.349 --> 02:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
order to make sure that
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
run-of-the-mill unfortunately
 
02:20:02.429 --> 02:20:02.439 align:start position:0%
run-ofthe-mill parents who just can't
 
02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
take care of their kids who are
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
violating other laws um are more
 
02:20:08.389 --> 02:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
comfortable surrendering their child
 
02:20:10.670 --> 02:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
instead of destroying the evidence that
 
02:20:13.270 --> 02:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
is that child so I I have to vote
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
against the amendment if the amendment
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
passes I have to vote against the ought
 
02:20:18.990 --> 02:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
to passes amended because I think we
 
02:20:20.910 --> 02:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to save lives and
 
02:20:24.670 --> 02:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
improve lives here and I wish I wish
 
02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
there was an easier answer but but I
 
02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
have to be opposed to removing that
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
exclusionary little representative uh
 
02:20:32.510 --> 02:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant then
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative Missour thank you Mr
 
02:20:37.469 --> 02:20:37.479 align:start position:0%
chair this is more of a procedural
 
02:20:40.389 --> 02:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
question than anything
 
02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
else the current law has lines 27
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
through 28 in the
 
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
law I supported the amendment because
 
02:20:52.389 --> 02:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of concern on lines 29 30
 
02:20:55.070 --> 02:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
and on top of page two because it
 
02:20:57.630 --> 02:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
provided too much of a immunity to the
 
02:20:59.389 --> 02:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
um to the
 
02:21:03.030 --> 02:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
parents if we pass this amendment are we
 
02:21:05.710 --> 02:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
therefore striking in the current law
 
02:21:10.030 --> 02:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
lines 27 and 28 or we just striking 29
 
02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
through the
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
end wases on thank you Mr chairman that
 
02:21:18.429 --> 02:21:18.439 align:start position:0%
is an amendment to current law so if we
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
remove section six then the current law
 
02:21:23.590 --> 02:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
which has those those lines 27 and 28
 
02:21:26.670 --> 02:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:31.270 --> 02:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:35.190 --> 02:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
four yes that that removes the amendment
 
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
to current law that is in section four
 
02:21:39.910 --> 02:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
so if we remove section four it's not
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
deleting um section RSA 132 D A4
 
02:21:46.830 --> 02:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
liability which are those lines 27
 
02:21:49.349 --> 02:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
through2 28 if we dilute Section 8 then
 
02:21:52.469 --> 02:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
that remains in law unchanged thank you
 
02:21:54.910 --> 02:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
because one of the concerns that we I
 
02:21:57.710 --> 02:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
heard anyways I think we all did was the
 
02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
concern about lines 2930 and the top of
 
02:22:04.950 --> 02:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
page two and it gets back into the
 
02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
possibility of having a conflict as far
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
as the ability for law enforcement it
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
was just a quag Mark um and I think
 
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
represent King is it it's one of those
 
02:22:16.110 --> 02:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
things that we need to really think
 
02:22:18.190 --> 02:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
through and way it's written right now I
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
think is
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
problematic um you know and law
 
02:22:23.950 --> 02:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement came and said they had
 
02:22:25.550 --> 02:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
concerns with it the Department of
 
02:22:27.070 --> 02:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services had concerns with
 
02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
it a lot of people had concerns with
 
02:22:32.670 --> 02:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
that language that's in the Bold so by
 
02:22:34.910 --> 02:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
deleting that I can move forward with
 
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
the bill I think the bill in line is
 
02:22:40.150 --> 02:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate has a lot of merits to it
 
02:22:41.469 --> 02:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
but i' be again i' be willing to work
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
with somebody to change the language
 
02:22:46.030 --> 02:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
that we can work on but at this point in
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
time I can support the bill with the
 
02:22:51.070 --> 02:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Missour thank
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I heard the assumption that
 
02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
placing a child in a safe haven box you
 
02:23:00.830 --> 02:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
know means that the child is being
 
02:23:03.429 --> 02:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
grossly abused that is an assumption
 
02:23:06.030 --> 02:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
that's not always the case a child can
 
02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
be placed in a safe haven box the parent
 
02:23:11.550 --> 02:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
could simply be not simply but could be
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
struggling with taking care of that
 
02:23:16.389 --> 02:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
child and simp just can't do it anymore
 
02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
and is has to give that baby up it does
 
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
not mean that that child has necessarily
 
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
sure sometimes that would be the case
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't always mean that the
 
02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
child is being neglected or abused and
 
02:23:29.429 --> 02:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
such and such as we heard and that it
 
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like that's a lot where this
 
02:23:34.429 --> 02:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
amendment came from um so that is an
 
02:23:37.389 --> 02:23:37.399 align:start position:0%
assumption that is not always accurate
 
02:23:39.389 --> 02:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
the amendment removes the
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
exclusion and places the consequence
 
02:23:44.349 --> 02:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
over the life of the child and that is
 
02:23:48.510 --> 02:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
something I cannot and will not support
 
02:23:52.269 --> 02:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
um it's I we've said it before many
 
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
times as we've been talking about this
 
02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill but I personally want a live baby
 
02:23:57.600 --> 02:23:58.750 align:start position:0%
bill but I personally want a live baby
without

02:23:58.750 --> 02:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:24:03.070 --> 02:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
prosecution um or prosecution with a
 
02:24:05.230 --> 02:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
dead baby and that's exactly what you
 
02:24:09.269 --> 02:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
said the death penalty I mean that I I
 
02:24:10.590 --> 02:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
that's something and so if this
 
02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
amendment passes I will not be voting
 
02:24:14.590 --> 02:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
for the bill as well because it
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
completely takes away from the heart and
 
02:24:17.550 --> 02:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
soul of the
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative kofalt
 
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
02:24:24.670 --> 02:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman so I I
 
02:24:28.349 --> 02:24:28.359 align:start position:0%
guess I want to return to the the
 
02:24:31.150 --> 02:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
logic U that the that sort of the basis
 
02:24:35.790 --> 02:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
for this amendment because there is an
 
02:24:39.309 --> 02:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
assumption that a parent well let me see
 
02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
if I can figure out how to articulate
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
this if a if a
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
parent drops off a
 
02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
child and there is evidence of abuse and
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
there is no exclusionary
 
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
rule then there is an opportunity to
 
02:24:57.630 --> 02:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
prosecute that
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
parent um and use that
 
02:25:03.190 --> 02:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
evidence if
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
they if they don't drop off the child
 
02:25:10.269 --> 02:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
because it's clear that they they could
 
02:25:12.790 --> 02:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
be subject to
 
02:25:15.190 --> 02:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
prosecution it is it's highly likely
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
that they are not going to drop off the
 
02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:17.510 align:start position:0%
that they are not going to drop off the
child

02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
there was a statement um at one point I
 
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
believe that or concern that would
 
02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
people even be aware and I'm going to
 
02:25:26.190 --> 02:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
say that I think word travels very fast
 
02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:25:31.670 --> 02:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
street um all it will take is one
 
02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
prosecution and I think that will put a
 
02:25:38.389 --> 02:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
a a permanent end to the use of these um
 
02:25:40.269 --> 02:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
baby boxes or safe
 
02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
havens um
 
02:25:46.269 --> 02:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
so you know on on the flip side to say
 
02:25:49.510 --> 02:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
that we are allowing that person to
 
02:25:53.910 --> 02:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
continue um to continue abusing um I
 
02:25:57.550 --> 02:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
would actually argue that if we are not
 
02:26:00.030 --> 02:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
accepting their decision
 
02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
to surrender their baby we are allowing
 
02:26:06.349 --> 02:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
them to continue abusing because they're
 
02:26:07.950 --> 02:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
not going to surrender their baby they
 
02:26:09.469 --> 02:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
are most likely if they're an abuser
 
02:26:11.269 --> 02:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
they are going to abuse that baby
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to abuse that child for
 
02:26:14.750 --> 02:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
many years
 
02:26:18.070 --> 02:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
um this is the conundrum this is not I
 
02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
mean just like the analogy that you
 
02:26:24.030 --> 02:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
presented representative I think it is a
 
02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
moral dilemma it's not an easy thing to
 
02:26:31.389 --> 02:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
answer it is for me however
 
02:26:35.070 --> 02:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
um I I will I will take the
 
02:26:38.590 --> 02:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable Choice over over the what
 
02:26:40.349 --> 02:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
I think what I personally believe is the
 
02:26:42.309 --> 02:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
really really bad choice I would much
 
02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
rather have that
 
02:26:49.790 --> 02:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
baby in a safe place then allow that
 
02:26:52.710 --> 02:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
that situation to continue uh and the
 
02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
abuse to continue representative
 
02:26:59.670 --> 02:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
Shapero yes thank you Mr chairman um and
 
02:27:01.710 --> 02:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for rep representative King
 
02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
for um articul articulating in such an
 
02:27:08.349 --> 02:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
eloquent way the almost impossible
 
02:27:10.990 --> 02:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
dilemma that we have here
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
um so my question is for someone who is
 
02:27:17.309 --> 02:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
um smarter than me
 
02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
um since Roman numeral 1 is already in
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
statute and um what is added as Roman
 
02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
numeral 2 on line 29 can somebody can
 
02:27:31.349 --> 02:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
somebody articulate the difference
 
02:27:35.070 --> 02:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
between the two of those I mean I mean
 
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
my impression is that we're giving
 
02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
um greater immunity but I don't really
 
02:27:42.990 --> 02:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
from just reading that I don't really
 
02:27:44.830 --> 02:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
understand there's
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
already in statute is already a certain
 
02:27:49.950 --> 02:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
immunity so if someone could explain the
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
difference between Roman numeral one and
 
02:27:53.950 --> 02:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 I would appreciate it
 
02:27:56.230 --> 02:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for that question
 
02:28:01.469 --> 02:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
so this one does prohibit um in any
 
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
claim at law or an equity but it doesn't
 
02:28:05.550 --> 02:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
have any claim that's for anything
 
02:28:07.590 --> 02:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's through a rulemaking process so
 
02:28:09.429 --> 02:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
if you look at it and you look at any of
 
02:28:11.670 --> 02:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
the rules that would happen through dcyf
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
where they might go for other children
 
02:28:15.870 --> 02:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
that are in somebody's care or go after
 
02:28:18.110 --> 02:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
them through something that's in rules
 
02:28:20.349 --> 02:28:20.359 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of other areas that are
 
02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
addressed other than just law and Equity
 
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
we have a special committee on due
 
02:28:26.269 --> 02:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
process and DF and there's a lot of
 
02:28:28.190 --> 02:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
stuff that happens outside of the laws
 
02:28:30.030 --> 02:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
that we set here in the legislature
 
02:28:31.349 --> 02:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that we've just sort of
 
02:28:33.950 --> 02:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
set to let them do um as part of their
 
02:28:38.070 --> 02:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
process so this would allow for you know
 
02:28:40.349 --> 02:28:40.359 align:start position:0%
if if you look at it too we had had uh
 
02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
we had had people that were talking
 
02:28:43.309 --> 02:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
about the necessity because they seemed
 
02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
to be more interested in Prosecuting
 
02:28:47.269 --> 02:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
parents than they were in getting the
 
02:28:49.230 --> 02:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
children out of the situation that was
 
02:28:51.269 --> 02:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
my read of the situation and that may
 
02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
just because be because I'm so
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
concerned we we all look at the
 
02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
potential risk and potential harm
 
02:28:59.309 --> 02:28:59.319 align:start position:0%
separately I would rather have the child
 
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
out of the dangerous situation over the
 
02:29:03.550 --> 02:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
prosecution but some of the testimony
 
02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
was talking in a way that made me think
 
02:29:08.830 --> 02:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
that they had different priorities so um
 
02:29:10.590 --> 02:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
that's why I think that that the section
 
02:29:12.910 --> 02:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
one that's already in law isn't enough
 
02:29:14.429 --> 02:29:14.439 align:start position:0%
because they said that they they they
 
02:29:15.950 --> 02:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
said that they were looking to go for
 
02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:17.910 align:start position:0%
said that they were looking to go for
prosecution

02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
prosecution
 
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
representative shapo so so Roman numeral
 
02:29:24.070 --> 02:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
one does not clude include immunity from
 
02:29:27.230 --> 02:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:30.150 --> 02:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
prosecution uh it was my understanding
 
02:29:33.030 --> 02:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
that they were looking to to take action
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
against parents with what would be an
 
02:29:37.750 --> 02:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
existing law so the existing law was not
 
02:29:39.349 --> 02:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
going to preclude them from taking
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
action against parents I'm not a lawyer
 
02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the difference between
 
02:29:43.990 --> 02:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
all of these different aspects that's
 
02:29:46.030 --> 02:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
why we're trying to get into it within
 
02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:47.349 align:start position:0%
why we're trying to get into it within
DC

02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
DC
 
02:29:49.389 --> 02:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
but it sounded like if we kept the
 
02:29:51.950 --> 02:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
language the same and remove section 4
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
if we kept those that those words in law
 
02:29:56.349 --> 02:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
they would be able to take action
 
02:29:58.830 --> 02:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
against parents even after they had
 
02:30:00.630 --> 02:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
dropped off their child I'm not sure
 
02:30:02.790 --> 02:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
exactly what action that would be but
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
they said that it would take away the
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
ability that they had with the current
 
02:30:07.550 --> 02:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
law representative Kwal and then
 
02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant um thank you so
 
02:30:13.309 --> 02:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
the um so the answer is that under
 
02:30:16.710 --> 02:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
current law criminal prosecution is is
 
02:30:18.429 --> 02:30:18.439 align:start position:0%
indeed possible and that's what happened
 
02:30:20.990 --> 02:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
in the do uh doino case I believe is the
 
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
last name um dates back two or three
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
years um and um yeah it was it was a it
 
02:30:32.710 --> 02:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
it actually was a murder case not of the
 
02:30:35.429 --> 02:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
child who was being dropped off but um
 
02:30:38.349 --> 02:30:38.359 align:start position:0%
of a child that was pre previously in
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
that person's custody um but information
 
02:30:44.429 --> 02:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
was collected during the um drop off
 
02:30:47.389 --> 02:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
process and that sort of triggered a
 
02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
a series of additional questions and
 
02:30:54.150 --> 02:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
leading to that um the defendant in that
 
02:30:56.590 --> 02:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
case said that she never would have
 
02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
dropped off
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
her her baby at the safe haven had she
 
02:31:03.230 --> 02:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
known that she would have been subject
 
02:31:03.240 --> 02:31:04.429 align:start position:0%
known that she would have been subject
to

02:31:04.429 --> 02:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
prosecution representative
 
02:31:10.190 --> 02:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
merchin thank you Mr
 
02:31:12.670 --> 02:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
chair I have before me
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
at something maybe the committee wants
 
02:31:17.269 --> 02:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
to discuss from me I could work with
 
02:31:19.950 --> 02:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
senator represent King on Seth
 
02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
King it basically says the parent acting
 
02:31:24.870 --> 02:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
pursuant of this chapter should not be
 
02:31:26.910 --> 02:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
subject to the petition under
 
02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
RSA 169c alleging neglect based solely
 
02:31:32.590 --> 02:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
on the actions described in this
 
02:31:34.750 --> 02:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
chapters and that section by the way
 
02:31:37.790 --> 02:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
goes back to the child protection act so
 
02:31:39.309 --> 02:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
what I think what I heard before with
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
the attorneys is that if all of a sudden
 
02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
through the investigation they find the
 
02:31:46.349 --> 02:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
person has an issue with drug abuse
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
abuse or has been fraudulent about
 
02:31:49.070 --> 02:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
certain things which has nothing to do
 
02:31:51.389 --> 02:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
with the child that's the concern they
 
02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
had because all of a sudden that
 
02:31:55.550 --> 02:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
evidence they find is no longer
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
admissible that's not I think the intent
 
02:31:58.710 --> 02:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
of what we're trying to do here we're
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
trying to protect the parent who decides
 
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
to drop a child off that protecting both
 
02:32:07.429 --> 02:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
the parent and the child but not
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
absolving them of all the other things
 
02:32:11.790 --> 02:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
that could come before such as they were
 
02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
selling drugs illegally doing things if
 
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
you will that we need to protect because
 
02:32:18.750 --> 02:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
if that's activity going on this masting
 
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
because of this dropping off the child I
 
02:32:25.309 --> 02:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to prohibit that either so
 
02:32:27.469 --> 02:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
maybe I can sit down with Seth Seth King
 
02:32:28.750 --> 02:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
and we can work on maybe another
 
02:32:31.030 --> 02:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to deal with
 
02:32:33.830 --> 02:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
this okay our representative Shapiro and
 
02:32:36.429 --> 02:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
then I'm before we go to your
 
02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative uh we were just talking
 
02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
and uh it's noon uh we were thinking
 
02:32:42.870 --> 02:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
maybe continuing this discussion until
 
02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
after we um we reconvene at 1:00 and
 
02:32:49.710 --> 02:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
deal at 1585 but why don't you make your
 
02:32:52.389 --> 02:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
your comment and U maybe during lunch
 
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll be able to come up with some
 
02:32:58.750 --> 02:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
ideas too okay um so I'm not really sure
 
02:33:00.429 --> 02:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
I understood the distinction between
 
02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral one and Roman numeral 2
 
02:33:07.349 --> 02:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
but um how however um I wonder if in
 
02:33:11.070 --> 02:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
crafting a different amendment that
 
02:33:13.790 --> 02:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
different kinds of law breaking could be
 
02:33:17.309 --> 02:33:17.319 align:start position:0%
separated um so that somebody could not
 
02:33:21.389 --> 02:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
um be prosecuted for letting
 
02:33:24.150 --> 02:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
their you know for dropping their child
 
02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:26.630 align:start position:0%
their you know for dropping their child
off

02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
off
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
for unrelated crimes like I don't know
 
02:33:32.349 --> 02:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
if they're unrelated but but crimes such
 
02:33:36.830 --> 02:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
as drug use or drug selling or dealing
 
02:33:40.429 --> 02:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
but that they could be still that there
 
02:33:40.439 --> 02:33:41.790 align:start position:0%
but that they could be still that there
could

02:33:41.790 --> 02:33:41.800 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:33:46.670 --> 02:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
be a narrow exception for if it was for
 
02:33:49.230 --> 02:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
assault or abuse of the child and that
 
02:33:52.710 --> 02:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
that would still not be excluded
 
02:33:55.389 --> 02:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
representative and that's what basically
 
02:33:59.590 --> 02:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
by exempting them from RSA 169c which is
 
02:34:01.790 --> 02:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
child's protection act that means
 
02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
anything in that act which deals with
 
02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
the abuse of a child and so forth is not
 
02:34:10.429 --> 02:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
admissible anything beyond that such as
 
02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with drugs other illegal
 
02:34:15.070 --> 02:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
activities is not
 
02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:16.710 align:start position:0%
activities is not
protected

02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
protected
 
02:34:18.590 --> 02:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
right last comment representative copal
 
02:34:19.790 --> 02:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
then we're going to continue this to
 
02:34:22.110 --> 02:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
after lunch uh thank you Mr chairman so
 
02:34:24.750 --> 02:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
I guess I would offer a scenario um
 
02:34:26.910 --> 02:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
because I I I want to return to the idea
 
02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
that this is excluding evidence that
 
02:34:31.790 --> 02:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
emerges as a direct result of them
 
02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
dropping off a baby aafe Haven it does
 
02:34:36.309 --> 02:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
not offer it does not prevent
 
02:34:38.790 --> 02:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
prosecution it simply excludes certain
 
02:34:41.790 --> 02:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
evidence so if you imagine for example
 
02:34:45.230 --> 02:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
um that a a mother is in an abusive
 
02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:46.750 align:start position:0%
um that a a mother is in an abusive
relationship

02:34:46.750 --> 02:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh the the husband or boyfriend is is
 
02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
abusive to the child child has bruises
 
02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:53.309 align:start position:0%
abusive to the child child has bruises
the

02:34:53.309 --> 02:34:53.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
mother has to ask the question if I
 
02:34:59.389 --> 02:34:59.399 align:start position:0%
bring my child to the safe haven box
 
02:35:00.429 --> 02:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
covered with
 
02:35:03.550 --> 02:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
bruises am I am I going to now be a
 
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
suspect I I would I would expect so um
 
02:35:08.990 --> 02:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
and am I now going to be potentially
 
02:35:11.349 --> 02:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
subject to criminal prosecution imagine
 
02:35:14.670 --> 02:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
that you know that that same child uh
 
02:35:16.750 --> 02:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
was observed with bruisers
 
02:35:21.510 --> 02:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
by a neighbor uh days before um
 
02:35:24.590 --> 02:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
prosecution would still be
 
02:35:26.790 --> 02:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
possible but they would have to exclude
 
02:35:28.870 --> 02:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
the evidence that the child had bruises
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
when they were dropped in the safe haven
 
02:35:32.750 --> 02:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
box so I mean it it's again we're sort
 
02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
of coming up with scenarios here but I'm
 
02:35:38.030 --> 02:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about the idea of um starting
 
02:35:41.230 --> 02:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
to parse um different types of crimes I
 
02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
think you know bottom line is I I I'm
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty firmly of the belief that you
 
02:35:50.830 --> 02:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
know it's it's more important to protect
 
02:35:55.309 --> 02:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
the life of a child um than do have a a
 
02:35:58.590 --> 02:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
100% um prosecution record I think you
 
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
know we absolutely should hold people to
 
02:36:05.710 --> 02:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
um to bring people to Justice um but if
 
02:36:07.030 --> 02:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
if we have an opportunity to save a
 
02:36:09.269 --> 02:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
child we should do that okay at this
 
02:36:11.590 --> 02:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
point why don't we recess until 1 at
 
02:36:13.790 --> 02:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
which time we'll take up 1585 and then
 
02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
we will resume our discussion of 1607
 
02:36:19.469 --> 02:36:19.479 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that so we'll stand in
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:44.880 --> 03:41:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
p.m.

03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:26.429 --> 03:41:26.439 align:start position:0%
Roa you were here I believe to speak to
 
03:41:26.439 --> 03:41:27.910 align:start position:0%
Roa you were here I believe to speak to
an

03:41:27.910 --> 03:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
an
 
03:41:31.110 --> 03:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
amendment um actually I can move her
 
03:41:34.630 --> 03:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment actually so um I'll move that
 
03:41:37.950 --> 03:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
I'll move that we adopt Amendment
 
03:41:40.229 --> 03:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
0908 and hopefully there'll be a second
 
03:41:42.429 --> 03:41:42.439 align:start position:0%
so we can discuss this representative
 
03:41:45.110 --> 03:41:45.120 align:start position:0%

oplc um the Board of Nursing and the
 
03:42:59.189 --> 03:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
association of nurses Nurses
 
03:43:01.389 --> 03:43:01.399 align:start position:0%
Association because all these
 
03:43:03.670 --> 03:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
individuals had concerns and really held
 
03:43:06.750 --> 03:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
a piece of the necessary changes that
 
03:43:10.469 --> 03:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
had to be made and um through through
 
03:43:14.429 --> 03:43:14.439 align:start position:0%
significant hard work and a lot of of a
 
03:43:17.790 --> 03:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
discussion the committee this sub
 
03:43:19.149 --> 03:43:19.159 align:start position:0%
committee came together with an
 
03:43:21.070 --> 03:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that's being presented towards
 
03:43:23.830 --> 03:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
to you and um it's something that
 
03:43:27.229 --> 03:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
everyone agrees with and I think that
 
03:43:30.550 --> 03:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's an example of good legislation
 
03:43:33.389 --> 03:43:33.399 align:start position:0%
because it does address a need that the
 
03:43:37.389 --> 03:43:37.399 align:start position:0%
um that New Hampshire has and yet the um
 
03:43:40.550 --> 03:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
Bill the amendment before you is um
 
03:43:42.269 --> 03:43:42.279 align:start position:0%
something that all the
 
03:43:45.670 --> 03:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are pleased with and if
 
03:43:47.229 --> 03:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
you'd like to address any specific
 
03:43:49.710 --> 03:43:49.720 align:start position:0%
questions or maybe Miss NATO can go over
 
03:43:53.030 --> 03:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
the process that we used thank you
 
03:43:54.309 --> 03:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
proceed Miss
 
03:43:57.309 --> 03:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
NATO so be happy to give a quick summary
 
03:43:59.469 --> 03:43:59.479 align:start position:0%
of the amendment so this bill is
 
03:44:02.309 --> 03:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
regarding medication administration in
 
03:44:03.750 --> 03:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
what are commonly referred to as
 
03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
Assisted Living which are supported
 
03:44:08.070 --> 03:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
Residential Care Homes or Residential
 
03:44:10.590 --> 03:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
Care Homes um so current currently in
 
03:44:13.550 --> 03:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
our facilities only RNs registered
 
03:44:16.269 --> 03:44:16.279 align:start position:0%
nurses LPNs licensed practical nurses or
 
03:44:19.309 --> 03:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
medication nursing assistants m&amp;as are
 
03:44:21.429 --> 03:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
allowed to administer medication to
 
03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
Residents and that is one of the primary
 
03:44:25.950 --> 03:44:25.960 align:start position:0%
reasons why a lot of our residents are
 
03:44:27.469 --> 03:44:27.479 align:start position:0%
in assisted living is because they
 
03:44:29.670 --> 03:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
either cognitively or physically need
 
03:44:31.389 --> 03:44:31.399 align:start position:0%
assistance with medication
 
03:44:33.269 --> 03:44:33.279 align:start position:0%
administration there is however a
 
03:44:35.550 --> 03:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
significant Workforce Staffing issue so
 
03:44:37.590 --> 03:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
it's a resident safety concern that we
 
03:44:40.070 --> 03:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
do not have enough Staffing of our R NS
 
03:44:42.389 --> 03:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
LPN and m&amp;as to adequately staff our
 
03:44:43.750 --> 03:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
facilities and therefore it puts
 
03:44:45.990 --> 03:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
residents at risk for safe medication
 
03:44:48.429 --> 03:44:48.439 align:start position:0%
administration So currently the pathway
 
03:44:50.229 --> 03:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
for people to be able to administer
 
03:44:51.910 --> 03:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
medications is either to be you
 
03:44:55.469 --> 03:44:55.479 align:start position:0%
obviously an RN LPN or an m&amp;a m&amp;as are
 
03:44:58.349 --> 03:44:58.359 align:start position:0%
lnas who have worked for at least two
 
03:45:00.070 --> 03:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's roughly two two and a half years
 
03:45:02.070 --> 03:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
full-time before they can qualify to
 
03:45:05.630 --> 03:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
take the m&amp;a certification course so we
 
03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
have a lot of Staff who are nursing
 
03:45:11.630 --> 03:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
students um going on to medical school
 
03:45:13.910 --> 03:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
so for college students or even high
 
03:45:16.429 --> 03:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
school students who have their LNA and
 
03:45:17.830 --> 03:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
because they're pursuing higher
 
03:45:20.189 --> 03:45:20.199 align:start position:0%
education goals they don't have the they
 
03:45:22.590 --> 03:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
don't meet the hours requirement nor is
 
03:45:25.870 --> 03:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
it fiscally ideal for them to also spend
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
the money and time to get those licenses
 
03:45:30.630 --> 03:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
and yet they're a very qualified staff
 
03:45:32.469 --> 03:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
to be able to safely administer
 
03:45:34.910 --> 03:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
medication so we're trying to create a
 
03:45:36.950 --> 03:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
different pathway so we will still have
 
03:45:41.189 --> 03:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
the path of RN LPN or LNA to m&amp;a to be
 
03:45:42.750 --> 03:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
able to administer but we're also
 
03:45:45.630 --> 03:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
creating a pathway where pcas Personal
 
03:45:47.670 --> 03:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
Care assistants who are unlicensed staff
 
03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
who do essentially the same role as
 
03:45:52.469 --> 03:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
Lenas in our facilities to be able to
 
03:45:57.070 --> 03:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
take a course that will be 40 hours long
 
03:46:00.309 --> 03:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
um defined and approved by the Board of
 
03:46:02.910 --> 03:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
Nursing it will be a certification so
 
03:46:04.790 --> 03:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
that we do have safeguards in place such
 
03:46:06.870 --> 03:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
that if they are not um if they have a
 
03:46:08.990 --> 03:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
high number of medication errors or we
 
03:46:09.000 --> 03:46:10.189 align:start position:0%
high number of medication errors or we
are

03:46:10.189 --> 03:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:46:12.670 --> 03:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
suspecting drug diversion or you know
 
03:46:14.590 --> 03:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
situations like that there is a a board
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
and a license that would be able to be
 
03:46:19.950 --> 03:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh revoked if um they are not meeting
 
03:46:22.990 --> 03:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
you know satisfactory requirements so we
 
03:46:25.189 --> 03:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
have sufficient safeguards in place
 
03:46:27.429 --> 03:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
including continuing education eight
 
03:46:29.269 --> 03:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
hours every two years specific to
 
03:46:30.870 --> 03:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
medication administration so that we
 
03:46:33.830 --> 03:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
feel that they are fully qualified to
 
03:46:36.830 --> 03:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
safely administer medication so we have
 
03:46:39.870 --> 03:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
called this new position a comma it's a
 
03:46:43.189 --> 03:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
certified Assisted Living medication Aid
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
the staff would only be able to work in
 
03:46:47.309 --> 03:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
the residential care or supported
 
03:46:49.189 --> 03:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
residential care facility so Assisted
 
03:46:51.550 --> 03:46:51.560 align:start position:0%
Living only they must be a direct
 
03:46:53.630 --> 03:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
employee of the organization so they
 
03:46:55.229 --> 03:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
can't be a home health care Aid that
 
03:46:56.950 --> 03:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
comes in to provide care to a resident
 
03:46:58.670 --> 03:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
they cannot be an agency staff member
 
03:47:00.269 --> 03:47:00.279 align:start position:0%
they must be directly employed by the
 
03:47:02.469 --> 03:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
residents and so we feel that this is
 
03:47:05.269 --> 03:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
going to open opportunities attract more
 
03:47:06.630 --> 03:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
people potentially to the healthcare
 
03:47:09.670 --> 03:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
field but still be able to you know
 
03:47:11.790 --> 03:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
safely administer medications to our
 
03:47:13.149 --> 03:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
residents and that's a critical
 
03:47:14.550 --> 03:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
component of what we do for our
 
03:47:16.389 --> 03:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
residents on a daily
 
03:47:19.510 --> 03:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
basis thank you any questions yes
 
03:47:21.710 --> 03:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative notam uh thank you for
 
03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so you know I've
 
03:47:26.830 --> 03:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
visited people in in nursing homes and
 
03:47:29.950 --> 03:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
um is a nursing home is it ass assisted
 
03:47:33.149 --> 03:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
Assisted Living so there would be a like
 
03:47:36.429 --> 03:47:36.439 align:start position:0%
a a medical room where all the drugs are
 
03:47:39.510 --> 03:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
kept and would these people be you know
 
03:47:41.110 --> 03:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
putting the pills into the little white
 
03:47:44.030 --> 03:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
cups that then they go uh how how does
 
03:47:47.630 --> 03:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
that work you know cuz I could yeah so
 
03:47:49.349 --> 03:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
in the current roles that are defined by
 
03:47:50.910 --> 03:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing there are different
 
03:47:52.870 --> 03:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
levels of medication administration so
 
03:47:56.030 --> 03:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
we do have some residents who are still
 
03:47:57.990 --> 03:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
capable of fully self-administering
 
03:48:00.429 --> 03:48:00.439 align:start position:0%
their own medication so if they have an
 
03:48:02.349 --> 03:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
order by their provider that allows them
 
03:48:03.950 --> 03:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
to keep it at their bedside they may
 
03:48:06.389 --> 03:48:06.399 align:start position:0%
keep it in their room most of the
 
03:48:08.269 --> 03:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
residents in our situation in my
 
03:48:10.870 --> 03:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
building we our policy is that we fully
 
03:48:12.670 --> 03:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
administer medication regardless of
 
03:48:14.469 --> 03:48:14.479 align:start position:0%
their cognitive or physical status so it
 
03:48:16.670 --> 03:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
depends on each home they can divise
 
03:48:18.950 --> 03:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
their own policies so it can be
 
03:48:21.149 --> 03:48:21.159 align:start position:0%
completely self- Administration it can
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
be medication with assistance but once
 
03:48:26.269 --> 03:48:26.279 align:start position:0%
you get a Beyond fully self-
 
03:48:28.269 --> 03:48:28.279 align:start position:0%
administering on your own you run into
 
03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
the complications of it needing to be an
 
03:48:33.950 --> 03:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
m&amp;a an LPN or an RN to administer
 
03:48:36.870 --> 03:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
because um even self- Administration
 
03:48:38.830 --> 03:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
with assist with assistance has some
 
03:48:40.149 --> 03:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
barriers like like they may be able to
 
03:48:42.149 --> 03:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
rip the package but they can't put it in
 
03:48:43.790 --> 03:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
their hand so there there's restrictions
 
03:48:47.389 --> 03:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
so this would help um make make it such
 
03:48:49.110 --> 03:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
that it's either fully self-
 
03:48:51.630 --> 03:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
Administration or the colas would be
 
03:48:53.910 --> 03:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to assist with the
 
03:48:58.030 --> 03:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:00.670 --> 03:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
medication followup representative not
 
03:49:03.110 --> 03:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
so of course they're they're not decide
 
03:49:06.110 --> 03:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
I mean the prescriptions are already
 
03:49:08.030 --> 03:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
written out and filled so they're not
 
03:49:10.469 --> 03:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
making decisions about
 
03:49:12.590 --> 03:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
whether they just like you know 40
 
03:49:14.830 --> 03:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
milligram two tablets which so that's
 
03:49:18.149 --> 03:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
fairly simple to yes bottle white
 
03:49:20.510 --> 03:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
correct so we are their home we're their
 
03:49:22.590 --> 03:49:22.600 align:start position:0%
residents we are not a medical treatment
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
facility in the sense that we are
 
03:49:26.670 --> 03:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
assessing diagnosing or prescribing all
 
03:49:27.870 --> 03:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
of the medications that we're
 
03:49:30.030 --> 03:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
administering have to be prescribed by a
 
03:49:32.349 --> 03:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
provider and our staff are simply
 
03:49:34.870 --> 03:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
following the instructions on the label
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
so we argue that if you are at home you
 
03:49:39.030 --> 03:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
can take your own medication without a
 
03:49:40.990 --> 03:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
class your daughter can set up your pill
 
03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
box for the week your friend can do it
 
03:49:45.630 --> 03:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
without any training exactly so this is
 
03:49:47.469 --> 03:49:47.479 align:start position:0%
their home we are simply following the
 
03:49:50.429 --> 03:49:50.439 align:start position:0%
orders most facilities also have an EMR
 
03:49:53.429 --> 03:49:53.439 align:start position:0%
that helps with the that we also not all
 
03:49:55.269 --> 03:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
of them but many of us use Pharmacy
 
03:49:57.469 --> 03:49:57.479 align:start position:0%
services that prepack them so there are
 
03:50:00.189 --> 03:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of safeguards in place but yes are
 
03:50:01.790 --> 03:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
we are simply administering per the
 
03:50:03.870 --> 03:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
instructions on the bottle if there were
 
03:50:06.429 --> 03:50:06.439 align:start position:0%
a medical emergency we're calling 911 or
 
03:50:08.750 --> 03:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
calling their physician we do not have
 
03:50:11.309 --> 03:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
the ability to assess or prescribe okay
 
03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you you made that very clear
 
03:50:14.110 --> 03:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel and then
 
03:50:15.790 --> 03:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
03:50:17.950 --> 03:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
03:50:20.149 --> 03:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to understand and I think
 
03:50:22.269 --> 03:50:22.279 align:start position:0%
I do but help me out is there what's the
 
03:50:24.189 --> 03:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
difference between a certified
 
03:50:26.790 --> 03:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
medication Aid and a
 
03:50:29.229 --> 03:50:29.239 align:start position:0%
comma okay so in New Hampshire it's
 
03:50:32.790 --> 03:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistants and they can
 
03:50:35.149 --> 03:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
work in locations other than Assisted
 
03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
Living so you can have lnas in the
 
03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
hospital setting so so their scope of
 
03:50:40.990 --> 03:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
practi is defined by the Board of
 
03:50:44.429 --> 03:50:44.439 align:start position:0%
Nursing um the difference with a comma
 
03:50:48.710 --> 03:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
is that they lnas have broader scope of
 
03:50:50.510 --> 03:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
practice some of which would not be
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
applicable in our setting as opposed to
 
03:50:54.630 --> 03:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
a hospital so the reason that's
 
03:50:57.229 --> 03:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
important to have a separate and clearly
 
03:50:59.070 --> 03:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
defined position that sist of living is
 
03:51:02.990 --> 03:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
that an LNA would need to
 
03:51:06.189 --> 03:51:06.199 align:start position:0%
um they don't use m&amp;as in a hospital
 
03:51:08.590 --> 03:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
setting lnas cannot pass medication in a
 
03:51:10.670 --> 03:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
hospital setting so it's it's two very
 
03:51:12.510 --> 03:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
different tracks only because lnas have
 
03:51:14.229 --> 03:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
a broader scope of practice and can work
 
03:51:17.189 --> 03:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
in settings other than Assisted Living
 
03:51:19.269 --> 03:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question yes yeah
 
03:51:21.149 --> 03:51:21.159 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what I figured I is there
 
03:51:24.309 --> 03:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
a lure now for them so this is creating
 
03:51:26.590 --> 03:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
the license it's creating the
 
03:51:28.750 --> 03:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
license representative Merchant then
 
03:51:31.189 --> 03:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr
 
03:51:34.349 --> 03:51:34.359 align:start position:0%
chairman and also thank you for spending
 
03:51:37.429 --> 03:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of time on this amendment one of
 
03:51:40.269 --> 03:51:40.279 align:start position:0%
the things I don't see in here and I
 
03:51:43.710 --> 03:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
apologize for not bringing it up to uh
 
03:51:46.309 --> 03:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
president go Grody
 
03:51:48.429 --> 03:51:48.439 align:start position:0%
earlier there's a limit there's no
 
03:51:51.149 --> 03:51:51.159 align:start position:0%
limitation if you will on what drugs can
 
03:51:52.950 --> 03:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
be administered it goes by the nursing
 
03:51:55.229 --> 03:51:55.239 align:start position:0%
board my concern is that injectable
 
03:51:57.630 --> 03:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
products because many times that's where
 
03:52:00.110 --> 03:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of Errors can Gravely be made
 
03:52:01.830 --> 03:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this statute that
 
03:52:04.950 --> 03:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
says they can that prohibits them from
 
03:52:08.269 --> 03:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
doing it so should we be thinking about
 
03:52:10.269 --> 03:52:10.279 align:start position:0%
somehow in inting some sort of language
 
03:52:12.229 --> 03:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
to be sure that we're not talking about
 
03:52:13.670 --> 03:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
injectable products talking about non-
 
03:52:15.950 --> 03:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
injectable products yes so in the
 
03:52:18.110 --> 03:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
current statute as it's written now it
 
03:52:21.510 --> 03:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
says medications and it specifies uh
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
certain medications defined by route and
 
03:52:28.149 --> 03:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
and dosage and that's where in the rules
 
03:52:29.790 --> 03:52:29.800 align:start position:0%
we would be looking to Define that
 
03:52:32.030 --> 03:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
further and we did make sure that Clause
 
03:52:33.510 --> 03:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
was in there because we did have
 
03:52:36.550 --> 03:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
multiple discussions about um that when
 
03:52:39.469 --> 03:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
we get to defining it in the rules there
 
03:52:41.790 --> 03:52:41.800 align:start position:0%
there is concern we all are in agreement
 
03:52:43.469 --> 03:52:43.479 align:start position:0%
that it would not be injectables other
 
03:52:46.189 --> 03:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
than potentially pens so yes we are all
 
03:52:47.830 --> 03:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
in agreement those involved in the
 
03:52:50.070 --> 03:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
committee that it would not include any
 
03:52:52.030 --> 03:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
medications that you would draw up by
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
syringe um we would still have to Define
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
if everyone's comfortable with it being
 
03:53:00.349 --> 03:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
for example insulin in a dialed up
 
03:53:04.590 --> 03:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
pen follow thank you so in saying that
 
03:53:07.110 --> 03:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
if that's the agreement of stakeholder
 
03:53:09.550 --> 03:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
Community is there any harm by putting
 
03:53:11.269 --> 03:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
that language into this amendment into
 
03:53:14.389 --> 03:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
the bill to be clear about that sure um
 
03:53:16.189 --> 03:53:16.199 align:start position:0%
no I think we would just have to have a
 
03:53:18.510 --> 03:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
little bit more discussion on that as
 
03:53:20.030 --> 03:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
the committee to be able to further
 
03:53:21.349 --> 03:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
amend that but I don't think there would
 
03:53:23.950 --> 03:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
be any opposition opposition to having
 
03:53:25.750 --> 03:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
that defined further in the statute as
 
03:53:28.309 --> 03:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to rule thank you representative
 
03:53:30.149 --> 03:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
Thomas and then representative Leon
 
03:53:32.550 --> 03:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
03:53:34.830 --> 03:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
coming here um my question along the
 
03:53:36.790 --> 03:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
lines of injectable medication is there
 
03:53:39.389 --> 03:53:39.399 align:start position:0%
any concern for schedule one drugs with
 
03:53:39.399 --> 03:53:40.349 align:start position:0%
any concern for schedule one drugs with
these

03:53:40.349 --> 03:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:53:43.550 --> 03:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
people so we do do hospice and end of
 
03:53:45.269 --> 03:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
life care and we do have residents who
 
03:53:47.670 --> 03:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
are routinely prescribed uh narcotic
 
03:53:49.229 --> 03:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
medications even if they're not on
 
03:53:51.990 --> 03:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
hospice and there was not concern
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
because it's a very controlled
 
03:53:55.389 --> 03:53:55.399 align:start position:0%
environment in our setting and again we
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
are strictly following the prescription
 
03:54:01.309 --> 03:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
um you know the specific order by the
 
03:54:04.229 --> 03:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
provider um but the reason we wanted to
 
03:54:05.790 --> 03:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
make sure this was a licensed or
 
03:54:07.269 --> 03:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
certified position is that so there
 
03:54:09.229 --> 03:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
would be safeguards in place that is a
 
03:54:11.790 --> 03:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
license that can be revoked if we have
 
03:54:14.830 --> 03:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
concerns about issues such as drug
 
03:54:16.990 --> 03:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
diversion representative L then
 
03:54:18.990 --> 03:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro um thank you Mr
 
03:54:20.750 --> 03:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you and everybody
 
03:54:22.550 --> 03:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
else behind you for your hard work on
 
03:54:25.990 --> 03:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
this um my mother-in-law went through an
 
03:54:28.349 --> 03:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
assisted living facility and um we're
 
03:54:30.030 --> 03:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
unsure if one of the chains of events
 
03:54:31.990 --> 03:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
was about uh medications that either did
 
03:54:33.830 --> 03:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
or didn't get to her or didn't or didn't
 
03:54:36.670 --> 03:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
get there correctly um who ultimately
 
03:54:38.510 --> 03:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
holds the responsibility if there's an
 
03:54:40.710 --> 03:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
error by the comma and who would who
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
would who would be responsible yeah so
 
03:54:44.309 --> 03:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
in the amendment we have specified that
 
03:54:45.830 --> 03:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
they're reportable to the
 
03:54:48.229 --> 03:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
administrator and we also specified that
 
03:54:52.429 --> 03:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
there must be an either a physician MD
 
03:54:57.630 --> 03:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
do APRN pa uh RN LPN must be available
 
03:55:00.149 --> 03:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
for consultation 24 hours a day whether
 
03:55:02.950 --> 03:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
in person electronically by phone so
 
03:55:04.750 --> 03:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
that if there any question about the
 
03:55:06.630 --> 03:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
specifics of the order they they would
 
03:55:08.510 --> 03:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
be required to have somebody on call
 
03:55:10.189 --> 03:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
avail able for that but ultimately it
 
03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
does fall under the administrator to be
 
03:55:14.510 --> 03:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for the medication errors
 
03:55:17.189 --> 03:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
and also responsible for reporting um if
 
03:55:18.950 --> 03:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
there should be any consideration of
 
03:55:21.110 --> 03:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
revocation of the license or
 
03:55:23.429 --> 03:55:23.439 align:start position:0%
certification what that followup and
 
03:55:25.790 --> 03:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
then as a followup so that means that if
 
03:55:28.110 --> 03:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
somebody is not giving them or giving
 
03:55:30.149 --> 03:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
them wrong or something if it rises to
 
03:55:32.950 --> 03:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
the a level of a legal claim against
 
03:55:34.389 --> 03:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
them it would be the administrator that
 
03:55:35.950 --> 03:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
somebody goes after because the
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
administrator is the one supervising
 
03:55:41.110 --> 03:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
them yes okay thank you that makes a lot
 
03:55:42.349 --> 03:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
of sense I just want to make sure that
 
03:55:43.830 --> 03:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately there's somebody who's
 
03:55:46.309 --> 03:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
responsible um for those edge cases to
 
03:55:48.510 --> 03:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully prevent the edge cases
 
03:55:49.710 --> 03:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and then
 
03:55:51.429 --> 03:55:51.439 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
03:55:53.349 --> 03:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking this
 
03:55:55.349 --> 03:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
question you you partially answered this
 
03:55:57.670 --> 03:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
question but I was wondering about the
 
03:56:02.030 --> 03:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
24hour a day consultation and you you
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
already went over who those who who
 
03:56:07.349 --> 03:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
provides that consultation but I don't
 
03:56:11.149 --> 03:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
know how big your facility is but are
 
03:56:14.309 --> 03:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
the facilities able to have access to
 
03:56:17.630 --> 03:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
that kind of 24-hour day consultation is
 
03:56:17.640 --> 03:56:18.830 align:start position:0%
that kind of 24-hour day consultation is
that

03:56:18.830 --> 03:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:56:21.469 --> 03:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
like you know is it difficult to get is
 
03:56:23.750 --> 03:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
it financially onerous is it really is
 
03:56:27.469 --> 03:56:27.479 align:start position:0%
it available sure so my facility is 24
 
03:56:29.710 --> 03:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
beds and I have a director of nursing
 
03:56:31.750 --> 03:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
who's an RN and I have a associate
 
03:56:33.349 --> 03:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
director of nursing who's an LPN
 
03:56:35.950 --> 03:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
full-time in my building specifically I
 
03:56:39.550 --> 03:56:39.560 align:start position:0%
employ four RNs and three LPNs
 
03:56:41.670 --> 03:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
there are much larger facilities that
 
03:56:43.950 --> 03:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
may even be stuffed 24 hours a day by an
 
03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
RN but we also run the gamut and there
 
03:56:48.830 --> 03:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
are some very small homes like six six
 
03:56:52.110 --> 03:56:52.120 align:start position:0%
licenses six beds so we put it as
 
03:56:54.269 --> 03:56:54.279 align:start position:0%
available by consultation so that if
 
03:56:56.429 --> 03:56:56.439 align:start position:0%
they are interested in in having Kos
 
03:56:59.469 --> 03:56:59.479 align:start position:0%
work for them they could contract with a
 
03:57:01.710 --> 03:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
service that would provide that so it
 
03:57:03.309 --> 03:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
specifically just states that they must
 
03:57:05.149 --> 03:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
have someone available 24 hours a day
 
03:57:06.710 --> 03:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
but it gives them flexibility whether
 
03:57:09.070 --> 03:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
that's their own Staffing or somebody
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
that they could contract with to provide
 
03:57:10.960 --> 03:57:12.189 align:start position:0%
that they could contract with to provide
that

03:57:12.189 --> 03:57:12.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:57:14.469 --> 03:57:14.479 align:start position:0%
service representative
 
03:57:18.590 --> 03:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman uh answer
 
03:57:21.550 --> 03:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
one of the questions about schedule one
 
03:57:24.630 --> 03:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
drugs a pharmacy cannot dispense the
 
03:57:26.910 --> 03:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
schedule one so if they're if I
 
03:57:28.469 --> 03:57:28.479 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly you're only
 
03:57:30.269 --> 03:57:30.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with prescriptions dispense by a
 
03:57:32.309 --> 03:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
pharmacist correct so therefore it would
 
03:57:35.790 --> 03:57:35.800 align:start position:0%
exclude gu one okay number two the
 
03:57:37.830 --> 03:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
administrator for the facility are they
 
03:57:39.790 --> 03:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
required to have a license what I'm
 
03:57:41.510 --> 03:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
trying to get to is that if we're going
 
03:57:44.070 --> 03:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
to hold them accountable outside of a
 
03:57:46.710 --> 03:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
liability point of view do they have a
 
03:57:50.030 --> 03:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
license that is at risk so I am an
 
03:57:52.269 --> 03:57:52.279 align:start position:0%
administrator we do not hold licenses
 
03:57:55.469 --> 03:57:55.479 align:start position:0%
but we are named on our license with
 
03:57:59.510 --> 03:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS so when we apply for our license
 
03:58:02.229 --> 03:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
with DHHS to operate our CST of living
 
03:58:05.070 --> 03:58:05.080 align:start position:0%
we have to name an administrator who is
 
03:58:06.990 --> 03:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
who is liable and responsible for the
 
03:58:09.110 --> 03:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
facility So I myself don't hold license
 
03:58:11.790 --> 03:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
but I I am the administrator named on my
 
03:58:11.800 --> 03:58:13.389 align:start position:0%
but I I am the administrator named on my
facilties

03:58:13.389 --> 03:58:13.399 align:start position:0%
facilties
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
license follow so what I'm trying to get
 
03:58:20.030 --> 03:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
to is what's the risk factor for the
 
03:58:22.229 --> 03:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
administrator outside of liability I
 
03:58:23.870 --> 03:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
mean a lot of times when you have a
 
03:58:26.429 --> 03:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
license that's at risk you may perceive
 
03:58:28.189 --> 03:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
things differently than if you don't
 
03:58:30.910 --> 03:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
have one so if there's no license for
 
03:58:33.910 --> 03:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
the administrator to lose um outside of
 
03:58:36.550 --> 03:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
a liability issue that's my concern so
 
03:58:38.070 --> 03:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure where to go with that
 
03:58:40.030 --> 03:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not sure if it would be okay I
 
03:58:42.469 --> 03:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
know licensing is here from DS I don't
 
03:58:45.110 --> 03:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
know if Kelly Keith is able to better
 
03:58:47.229 --> 03:58:47.239 align:start position:0%
answer that question if she might be
 
03:58:48.710 --> 03:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to answer
 
03:58:51.229 --> 03:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
that I think it would be helpful if I
 
03:58:54.469 --> 03:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
made chairman is that if if there's a
 
03:58:57.750 --> 03:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
way to say if something happens that you
 
03:58:59.950 --> 03:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
cannot hold another license or you can't
 
03:59:02.229 --> 03:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
be an administrator at at that facility
 
03:59:04.710 --> 03:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
or any other facility that way there be
 
03:59:08.309 --> 03:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
it some way to um be sure you have S
 
03:59:12.030 --> 03:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:14.309 --> 03:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
game good afternoon for the record my
 
03:59:16.990 --> 03:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
name is Dorian shley I'm the manager of
 
03:59:18.309 --> 03:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Licensing and
 
03:59:21.510 --> 03:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
certification at DHHS to answer your
 
03:59:22.990 --> 03:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
question representative Merchant
 
03:59:24.550 --> 03:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not a question that
 
03:59:26.110 --> 03:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
I could answer it sounds more of a legal
 
03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
question is terms of liability um I can
 
03:59:31.750 --> 03:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
say that from the facilities lens we
 
03:59:33.349 --> 03:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
license Health Facilities we don't
 
03:59:36.590 --> 03:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
license individuals so the administrator
 
03:59:39.510 --> 03:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
on record for all licens facilities is
 
03:59:41.189 --> 03:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
the person responsible for all
 
03:59:43.750 --> 03:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
operations and activities that occur but
 
03:59:45.830 --> 03:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of what um representative Lon
 
03:59:47.830 --> 03:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
and you are asking that sounds more like
 
03:59:50.910 --> 03:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
a legal question um um from a liability
 
03:59:53.189 --> 03:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
for the individual so I'm not I'm not
 
03:59:55.269 --> 03:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
able to answer that question but it's a
 
03:59:56.790 --> 03:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
very good
 
03:59:59.590 --> 03:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
question representative Seth King thank
 
04:00:00.630 --> 04:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
04:00:02.950 --> 04:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
chair um to piggyback on what the last
 
04:00:04.349 --> 04:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
two representatives were talking about
 
04:00:08.910 --> 04:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that um nurses
 
04:00:11.590 --> 04:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
um at these assisted living facilities
 
04:00:14.030 --> 04:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
they spend really the majority of their
 
04:00:16.030 --> 04:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
time handing out medication and and
 
04:00:19.309 --> 04:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
dealing with medication and they're
 
04:00:21.389 --> 04:00:21.399 align:start position:0%
constantly at fear of losing their
 
04:00:24.070 --> 04:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
license um be even if one little thing
 
04:00:25.790 --> 04:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
goes wrong even if a pill goes missing
 
04:00:27.590 --> 04:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
they're afraid that that could cost them
 
04:00:31.389 --> 04:00:31.399 align:start position:0%
their license and that you know
 
04:00:34.750 --> 04:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
if if the C if these new commas don't
 
04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
have that that sort of Sword of damic
 
04:00:39.349 --> 04:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
hanging over their head all the time
 
04:00:41.710 --> 04:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
then it's just an interesting something
 
04:00:43.389 --> 04:00:43.399 align:start position:0%
to think about I I'm not taking a
 
04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
position on it one way or the other um
 
04:00:50.030 --> 04:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
and my question though for you is that I
 
04:00:52.910 --> 04:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
just imagine that if this new Cola
 
04:00:56.670 --> 04:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
position were created that you could
 
04:00:58.790 --> 04:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
reduce you said you had four nurses you
 
04:01:01.030 --> 04:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
could potentially reduce three of those
 
04:01:04.189 --> 04:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
nurses positions and and replace them
 
04:01:07.550 --> 04:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
with kma because they're like I said so
 
04:01:09.870 --> 04:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
much of their time is spent doing out
 
04:01:12.590 --> 04:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
medication that if you if you use these
 
04:01:14.790 --> 04:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
you you'd you know you wouldn't need so
 
04:01:19.309 --> 04:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
much nursing uh manh hours um so could
 
04:01:21.830 --> 04:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
you address that a little bit um and as
 
04:01:24.950 --> 04:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
well as the the licensing issue that the
 
04:01:27.070 --> 04:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
that the nurses fear of losing thank you
 
04:01:27.080 --> 04:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
that the nurses fear of losing thank you
sure

04:01:28.910 --> 04:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:01:32.990 --> 04:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
so my RNs are not full-time just a quop
 
04:01:35.590 --> 04:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
that not full-time FTE but that is
 
04:01:37.790 --> 04:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
really the heart of this issue is that
 
04:01:40.510 --> 04:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
there is a a major shortage of nurses
 
04:01:42.910 --> 04:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
LPN and m&amp;as such that we are struggling
 
04:01:45.189 --> 04:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
to staff our facilities so it's a
 
04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
resident safety issue caused by the lack
 
04:01:50.710 --> 04:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
of Staffing so we compete with hospitals
 
04:01:52.469 --> 04:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
and nursing homes for nursing staff and
 
04:01:55.229 --> 04:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
there I for myself my facility went four
 
04:01:56.710 --> 04:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
years almost four and a half years
 
04:01:59.149 --> 04:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
through covid where I constantly had
 
04:02:01.790 --> 04:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
open positions that I could not fill for
 
04:02:03.750 --> 04:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
what we generally classifies as Med
 
04:02:07.349 --> 04:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
givers um so that that is really the
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
concern and the impus of this bill
 
04:02:13.550 --> 04:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
um the whole goal here is to create a
 
04:02:16.030 --> 04:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
safe pathway and of course where they
 
04:02:17.870 --> 04:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
are going to get 40 hours of training to
 
04:02:19.950 --> 04:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
be able to safely and effectively pass
 
04:02:21.910 --> 04:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
those medications because we are not
 
04:02:23.750 --> 04:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
able to successfully staff and fully
 
04:02:25.630 --> 04:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
staff our facilities and therefore
 
04:02:28.349 --> 04:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
putting residents at risk so yes it
 
04:02:30.830 --> 04:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
would allow me to use the staff that is
 
04:02:32.790 --> 04:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
a goal instead of nurses and so forth
 
04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
and I think as you all are aware we have
 
04:02:36.630 --> 04:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
a major health care Staffing crisis in
 
04:02:38.910 --> 04:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
this us we have one of the oldest
 
04:02:40.389 --> 04:02:40.399 align:start position:0%
populations here in New Hampshire we're
 
04:02:42.590 --> 04:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the Baby Boomers so
 
04:02:44.670 --> 04:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get ahead of this by
 
04:02:46.670 --> 04:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
creating this position so that we do
 
04:02:49.030 --> 04:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
have the available Staffing to safely
 
04:02:51.229 --> 04:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
administer medications to our residents
 
04:02:52.910 --> 04:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
and as I mentioned before this is their
 
04:02:55.990 --> 04:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
home um we at home they're allowed to
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
take it we feel that a 40-hour class for
 
04:03:00.429 --> 04:03:00.439 align:start position:0%
our staff who are doing this as their
 
04:03:03.229 --> 04:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
full-time job are are going to be safely
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
qualified to do this and that it's not
 
04:03:08.189 --> 04:03:08.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily the best use of a nurse in
 
04:03:10.429 --> 04:03:10.439 align:start position:0%
our building um just to be used to pass
 
04:03:13.070 --> 04:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
out medication as far as the license I
 
04:03:14.790 --> 04:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
can say that
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
um oh okay um Elizabeth from oplc would
 
04:03:20.910 --> 04:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
be able to answer more specifically the
 
04:03:22.309 --> 04:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
questions that you have related to the
 
04:03:23.870 --> 04:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
license and the cola and the
 
04:03:32.670 --> 04:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:35.550 --> 04:03:35.560 align:start position:0%
liability Elizabeth Eaton uh Council to
 
04:03:37.389 --> 04:03:37.399 align:start position:0%
the board of nursing uh in the Board of
 
04:03:40.189 --> 04:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
Nursing w p in as a stakeholder because
 
04:03:42.590 --> 04:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh due to the concerns about
 
04:03:45.389 --> 04:03:45.399 align:start position:0%
accountability for this new position um
 
04:03:48.510 --> 04:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
and so the Board of Nursing um not only
 
04:03:52.229 --> 04:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
elected to um be the the jurisdiction
 
04:03:54.950 --> 04:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
over this position but is eager to um
 
04:03:56.469 --> 04:03:56.479 align:start position:0%
they understand the the
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
shortage uh
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
and so I want to make make it clear that
 
04:04:03.229 --> 04:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
these are this is in the nurse Practice
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
Act they would have jurisdiction and so
 
04:04:08.670 --> 04:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
a complaint could come in about a c
 
04:04:12.469 --> 04:04:12.479 align:start position:0%
who um is not passing out pills or is is
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
somehow um messing up uh and and it
 
04:04:17.710 --> 04:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
would come to the Board of Nursing and
 
04:04:19.429 --> 04:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
they would uh
 
04:04:23.710 --> 04:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:27.469 --> 04:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
sanctions okay um well representative B
 
04:04:29.149 --> 04:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up earlier or no
 
04:04:31.550 --> 04:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
oh okay representative Merchant thank
 
04:04:36.590 --> 04:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:38.990 --> 04:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
14 on page
 
04:04:41.870 --> 04:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
one instead of saying certified by the
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
office licensed by the office that way
 
04:04:47.389 --> 04:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
there they have a license and therefore
 
04:04:48.950 --> 04:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
that could be pulled by the Board of
 
04:04:51.630 --> 04:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
Nursing so in uh
 
04:04:54.630 --> 04:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
541a the definition of license includes
 
04:04:57.229 --> 04:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
the word certification and so a
 
04:04:59.590 --> 04:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
certification even though it's it sounds
 
04:05:00.990 --> 04:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
different from a license it is
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
considered in New Hampshire a license
 
04:05:04.990 --> 04:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
and so it's no different from uh a
 
04:05:06.870 --> 04:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistant or a
 
04:05:06.880 --> 04:05:08.710 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistant or a
certified

04:05:08.710 --> 04:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
certified
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh Assisted Living medication assistant
 
04:05:13.950 --> 04:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
they they hold the same kind of license
 
04:05:17.710 --> 04:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you so if they're synonymous is
 
04:05:19.149 --> 04:05:19.159 align:start position:0%
there any reason we could not change
 
04:05:21.990 --> 04:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:23.950 --> 04:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
licensed I that's something for the
 
04:05:26.189 --> 04:05:26.199 align:start position:0%
group to discuss I think walma sounds a
 
04:05:34.630 --> 04:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:34.640 --> 04:05:36.189 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:05:36.189 --> 04:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:05:42.429 --> 04:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:44.750 --> 04:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other
 
04:05:50.189 --> 04:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:54.389 --> 04:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:57.030 --> 04:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing none representative
 
04:05:57.040 --> 04:05:58.550 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing none representative
South

04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
South
 
04:06:02.149 --> 04:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
King yeah um I don't know how I'm going
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
to vote on this amendment it's sort of
 
04:06:07.030 --> 04:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's sort of last minute and I was
 
04:06:10.269 --> 04:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
originally TP on the the main bill
 
04:06:12.670 --> 04:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
because it was so clean and simple and
 
04:06:14.670 --> 04:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
there's at least it seemed like it there
 
04:06:18.630 --> 04:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
was and there's um there's a lot here um
 
04:06:20.990 --> 04:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
and I I kind of have mixed feelings
 
04:06:23.710 --> 04:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
about it I mean on the one hand um I I
 
04:06:26.149 --> 04:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
like the idea because I I do recognize
 
04:06:28.590 --> 04:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
that the nurses they're they're totally
 
04:06:30.750 --> 04:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
underst staffed and they're maybe even
 
04:06:32.469 --> 04:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
more prone to making mistakes because
 
04:06:36.189 --> 04:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
they're so understaffed and um this
 
04:06:38.469 --> 04:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
could help free up
 
04:06:40.229 --> 04:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
some of the problems we see in assisted
 
04:06:40.239 --> 04:06:41.590 align:start position:0%
some of the problems we see in assisted
living

04:06:41.590 --> 04:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
living
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
facilities I don't know um I have mixed
 
04:06:47.269 --> 04:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
feelings I'll probably go along with it
 
04:06:50.229 --> 04:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
though okay other discussion
 
04:06:51.990 --> 04:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
04:06:54.590 --> 04:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
04:06:56.429 --> 04:06:56.439 align:start position:0%
um are we inventing something or does
 
04:06:57.750 --> 04:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
this Exist
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
Elsewhere um so we are inventing
 
04:07:03.469 --> 04:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
something well we're taking something
 
04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
copying something that already exists in
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
Maine um and I believe just Maine right
 
04:07:11.550 --> 04:07:11.560 align:start position:0%
now Maine and Massachusetts but I also
 
04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
kind of wanted there's a lot lot more
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
people here than at the session that we
 
04:07:19.229 --> 04:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
were at um at the end of January I
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
believe it was or we're just in a much
 
04:07:23.269 --> 04:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
smaller room so I wanted to give a
 
04:07:25.469 --> 04:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
little okay very good then because I
 
04:07:27.189 --> 04:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
just wanted to give a little history
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
actually to representative King to your
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
point um we had come in front of the
 
04:07:35.389 --> 04:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
committee with the First Amendment um I
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
think it was the end of January because
 
04:07:38.229 --> 04:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
we were asked at that that point we
 
04:07:40.429 --> 04:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
actually did suggest or recommend that
 
04:07:42.910 --> 04:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
it go to study committee um and that the
 
04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
group behind me and others that aren't
 
04:07:47.630 --> 04:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
here get together and kind of explore
 
04:07:49.950 --> 04:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
this because it's very large and it's
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
very important um we were advised at
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
that meeting to come up with a report to
 
04:07:58.550 --> 04:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
present to you today um um
 
04:08:00.269 --> 04:08:00.279 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro asked if we could
 
04:08:04.269 --> 04:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
do that soon we said sure um and so
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
through that process we ended up
 
04:08:06.720 --> 04:08:08.750 align:start position:0%
through that process we ended up
surprisingly

04:08:08.750 --> 04:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
surprisingly
 
04:08:12.109 --> 04:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
with an agreed upon amendment to create
 
04:08:14.229 --> 04:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
an entirely new position in the state of
 
04:08:16.429 --> 04:08:16.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that replicates what's in
 
04:08:18.189 --> 04:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
Main and Massachusetts that's working
 
04:08:20.550 --> 04:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
well for them so I just want to give a
 
04:08:22.429 --> 04:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
little bit of context we're certainly
 
04:08:25.030 --> 04:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
open to studying this more but really
 
04:08:26.670 --> 04:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
believe if something's working in our
 
04:08:28.590 --> 04:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
sister states that it would be something
 
04:08:30.910 --> 04:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
that we would want to consider doing
 
04:08:35.429 --> 04:08:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:37.830 --> 04:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
helpful they're not listening so I can
 
04:08:40.389 --> 04:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
ask it is
 
04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
does let's try to sneak her in there so
 
04:08:46.189 --> 04:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
the the um the 40-hour course does that
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
exist already or will that have to be
 
04:08:50.030 --> 04:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
created it will be created and do you
 
04:08:52.389 --> 04:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
know what a time frame for that would be
 
04:08:55.229 --> 04:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
um well I think the amendment says this
 
04:08:57.429 --> 04:08:57.439 align:start position:0%
act takes effect 60 days after its
 
04:08:57.439 --> 04:08:59.510 align:start position:0%
act takes effect 60 days after its
passage

04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
passage
 
04:09:03.510 --> 04:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
so I think we have a lot of that
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
done it's a lot of un yes as quickly as
 
04:09:09.550 --> 04:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
we POS we did a lot of work really fast
 
04:09:12.189 --> 04:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping that we would do the same
 
04:09:14.189 --> 04:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
going forward and it's a very um it's a
 
04:09:16.670 --> 04:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
collaborative group across all agencies
 
04:09:19.550 --> 04:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
that have worked really well together
 
04:09:21.469 --> 04:09:21.479 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
04:09:24.269 --> 04:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
chair I noticed in the original Bill
 
04:09:25.750 --> 04:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
there was rule making Authority given to
 
04:09:26.750 --> 04:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
the board of
 
04:09:29.590 --> 04:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
nursing but in the amendment that goes
 
04:09:31.550 --> 04:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
away so I want to be clear we don't lose
 
04:09:33.149 --> 04:09:33.159 align:start position:0%
that rule making Authority by inserting
 
04:09:35.910 --> 04:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment because it's basically
 
04:09:38.149 --> 04:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
replace all
 
04:09:39.429 --> 04:09:39.439 align:start position:0%
so I want to be sure that we don't
 
04:09:41.950 --> 04:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
somehow inadvertently not give the Board
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
of Nursing rulemaking authority to
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:51.910 --> 04:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
Etc give me a moment to find where it is
 
04:09:54.269 --> 04:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
in the um in the amendment but the rule
 
04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:06.439 --> 04:10:14.229 align:start position:0%
 
there

04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:15.870 --> 04:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
I mean if you're inserting this the
 
04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
nursing practice and if it isn't well so
 
04:10:21.790 --> 04:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
here's what it is here's where it is
 
04:10:23.269 --> 04:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
they they already have rule making
 
04:10:24.590 --> 04:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
Authority for all
 
04:10:28.229 --> 04:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
licenses um for all persons licensed
 
04:10:30.790 --> 04:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
under this chapter and so under uh
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
326b uh any any license type they have
 
04:10:36.670 --> 04:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
rule making authority over and so they
 
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
didn't feel the need to to
 
04:10:41.870 --> 04:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
specify I I would I would caution
 
04:10:44.349 --> 04:10:44.359 align:start position:0%
against that um I think it be if you're
 
04:10:46.750 --> 04:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
not opposed to it to insert language in
 
04:10:48.109 --> 04:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
there that's very clear you have
 
04:10:49.830 --> 04:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority because I know
 
04:10:51.750 --> 04:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes legislative body has a
 
04:10:54.189 --> 04:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
tendency to not look at when it it's the
 
04:10:56.349 --> 04:10:56.359 align:start position:0%
Jael car and want to be clear that you
 
04:10:58.950 --> 04:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
have Ru making Authority in the act
 
04:11:00.870 --> 04:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
itself and not something referring back
 
04:11:02.630 --> 04:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
to a broad grou making Authority just to
 
04:11:05.790 --> 04:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
be on the safe side thank
 
04:11:08.950 --> 04:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
you other
 
04:11:11.109 --> 04:11:11.119 align:start position:0%
questions apparently I do representative
 
04:11:12.830 --> 04:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
Nel your microphone is on and your hand
 
04:11:15.790 --> 04:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
is sorry I've been urged by one of my
 
04:11:17.630 --> 04:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
colleagues to ask you what they call
 
04:11:19.229 --> 04:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
this in other states and what the
 
04:11:19.239 --> 04:11:20.750 align:start position:0%
this in other states and what the
acronym

04:11:20.750 --> 04:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
acronym
 
04:11:24.670 --> 04:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
is so Maine used a certified medication
 
04:11:27.630 --> 04:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
Aid and we are advised to not use that
 
04:11:30.070 --> 04:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
because it's too close to CRNA a
 
04:11:33.990 --> 04:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
certified nurse and nus sorry CNA a so
 
04:11:36.990 --> 04:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
that's why uh we deviated from that we
 
04:11:39.309 --> 04:11:39.319 align:start position:0%
also wanted to be very clear that this
 
04:11:43.189 --> 04:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
role can only work in HP 804 and 805 the
 
04:11:45.309 --> 04:11:45.319 align:start position:0%
supported Residential Care Homes that we
 
04:11:47.070 --> 04:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
made sure we put assist of living in the
 
04:11:49.590 --> 04:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
title so that it was very clear that
 
04:11:51.349 --> 04:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
that is the only place this license
 
04:11:54.389 --> 04:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:57.469 --> 04:11:57.479 align:start position:0%
effect other
 
04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none
 
04:12:03.189 --> 04:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh any other discussion
 
04:12:05.030 --> 04:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
on this amendment one question that has
 
04:12:05.040 --> 04:12:05.830 align:start position:0%
on this amendment one question that has
been

04:12:05.830 --> 04:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:12:09.510 --> 04:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
raised and is Christina back
 
04:12:09.520 --> 04:12:11.030 align:start position:0%
raised and is Christina back
there

04:12:11.030 --> 04:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
um well and and you probably can't
 
04:12:14.830 --> 04:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
answer this there's a question as to
 
04:12:16.030 --> 04:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
whether this amendment would be
 
04:12:17.710 --> 04:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
considered a Germain Amendment or not
 
04:12:19.550 --> 04:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
where it creates a new
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
position yeah well we're we're doing
 
04:12:22.870 --> 04:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
that right now but I didn't know if you
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:36.239 --> 04:12:40.229 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:12:40.229 --> 04:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:41.870 --> 04:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that we're doing that right
 
04:12:43.389 --> 04:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
now but I I didn't know if you had any
 
04:12:45.830 --> 04:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
thoughts or any insights on
 
04:12:49.870 --> 04:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
it yeah I would uh I would think that
 
04:12:51.790 --> 04:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
you representative we is a co-sponsor
 
04:12:53.790 --> 04:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
and she usually has a pretty good sense
 
04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
of these things
 
04:12:59.349 --> 04:12:59.359 align:start position:0%
also um Mr chairman yes when I look at
 
04:13:01.630 --> 04:13:01.640 align:start position:0%
the original bill it's referencing a
 
04:13:04.349 --> 04:13:04.359 align:start position:0%
different RSA which is facilities this
 
04:13:05.950 --> 04:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
is referencing something more towards
 
04:13:09.030 --> 04:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing so I do I think
 
04:13:10.630 --> 04:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
having the clerk weigh in on this would
 
04:13:14.670 --> 04:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
probably be be helpful and wise okay all
 
04:13:16.990 --> 04:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
right again we're emailing him right now
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:25.070 --> 04:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
answer okay um all right so obviously we
 
04:13:27.309 --> 04:13:27.319 align:start position:0%
we can't really vote on this at the
 
04:13:27.319 --> 04:13:30.830 align:start position:0%
we can't really vote on this at the
moment

04:13:30.830 --> 04:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:34.149 --> 04:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
um I guess what we could do is revisit
 
04:13:38.469 --> 04:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
16007 in the interim and um and then
 
04:13:39.670 --> 04:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
come back to
 
04:13:42.830 --> 04:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
this representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
04:13:45.309 --> 04:13:45.319 align:start position:0%
chairman I just have a question about
 
04:13:48.189 --> 04:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
procedure um if it's not a if it is a
 
04:13:50.990 --> 04:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
Germaine Amendment there were
 
04:13:53.710 --> 04:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
two smallest changes that were brought
 
04:13:56.030 --> 04:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
up one about injectable medications and
 
04:14:01.349 --> 04:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
one about um Ru making Authority um is
 
04:14:03.590 --> 04:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
there any way to vote on this amendment
 
04:14:05.950 --> 04:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
and have those put in later or would we
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
have to have the amendment re written to
 
04:14:11.149 --> 04:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
include those well once once we vote on
 
04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
this bill we're done with it in term
 
04:14:15.870 --> 04:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um I think we need to
 
04:14:19.710 --> 04:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
have that drafted and I know that OS is
 
04:14:21.269 --> 04:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
um they're working to get everything to
 
04:14:22.830 --> 04:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
everybody who needs last minute things
 
04:14:24.349 --> 04:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
right now so we I think we'll find out
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
if this is Germaine or not and if it
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
needs a if it does need to have a
 
04:14:30.590 --> 04:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
separate hearing and um regardless we'll
 
04:14:32.670 --> 04:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
probably want to end up executing this
 
04:14:34.910 --> 04:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
one on the 20th most likely just so that
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
we have a chance to digest it even if it
 
04:14:39.990 --> 04:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
is ger I mean I like it a lot um but I
 
04:14:41.109 --> 04:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we're doing
 
04:14:42.670 --> 04:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
everything in the right process and we
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
don't end up having a wrench thrown into
 
04:14:46.950 --> 04:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
the works of the last minute and lose
 
04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
all of this really important valuable
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
work I just hope that we can ascertain
 
04:14:54.510 --> 04:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
that we're all in agreement today with
 
04:14:57.030 --> 04:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
the rewriting so that we don't have to
 
04:15:00.070 --> 04:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
relitigate the whole thing on the
 
04:15:03.070 --> 04:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
20th I I know that I personally am I
 
04:15:04.950 --> 04:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
guess if anybody has any questions I'm
 
04:15:06.630 --> 04:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm try not trying to jump in on
 
04:15:08.990 --> 04:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
this um we we probably would be able to
 
04:15:10.630 --> 04:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
hit a calendar deadline if we do this
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
quickly to have an non derain hearing
 
04:15:14.630 --> 04:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to have those of us who
 
04:15:16.269 --> 04:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
need to be here for it and then having
 
04:15:18.429 --> 04:15:18.439 align:start position:0%
an exec on the 20th would be my thought
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
just to make sure we're doing everything
 
04:15:21.750 --> 04:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
on the up and up but if anybody wants to
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
speak up especially if they have
 
04:15:28.349 --> 04:15:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:32.910 --> 04:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
palaza I support moving it to 20 but uh
 
04:15:35.870 --> 04:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't see the need to further amend
 
04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
like uh like was said because it's
 
04:15:42.469 --> 04:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
already in this chapter it's already on
 
04:15:47.189 --> 04:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
under this board so uh I don't think we
 
04:15:50.149 --> 04:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
need those two amendments to this amend
 
04:15:53.830 --> 04:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment but it's just my
 
04:15:53.840 --> 04:15:57.630 align:start position:0%
Amendment but it's just my
opinion

04:15:57.630 --> 04:15:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:02.550 --> 04:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:05.229 --> 04:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
discussion okay well I I sense that we
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
want to move this to the uh there's
 
04:16:09.469 --> 04:16:09.479 align:start position:0%
enough concern to move this and continue
 
04:16:11.229 --> 04:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
it to the 20th where we have several
 
04:16:14.109 --> 04:16:14.119 align:start position:0%
other uh bills already certainly not a
 
04:16:16.109 --> 04:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
whole day's worth but we we will be
 
04:16:19.070 --> 04:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
meeting on the 20th so uh but I would
 
04:16:20.990 --> 04:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
need a motion I would I would need to
 
04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%

04:16:36.349 --> 04:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
that till the 20th thank you everyone
 
04:16:38.189 --> 04:16:38.199 align:start position:0%

04:16:38.199 --> 04:16:39.870 align:start position:0%
who testified and and offered
information

04:16:39.870 --> 04:16:39.880 align:start position:0%

is Germain all right let's get back to
 
04:16:51.910 --> 04:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
16007 then representative oth King thank
 
04:16:55.070 --> 04:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um after having um done
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
some discussion with representative
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
Merchant um I've decided to withdraw my
 
04:17:02.229 --> 04:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
motion of the amendment so that
 
04:17:04.830 --> 04:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can get a some time in
 
04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
discussing discussing this in a little B
 
04:17:08.670 --> 04:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
further deta detail maybe we come up
 
04:17:12.550 --> 04:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
with a different amendment to to that so
 
04:17:13.910 --> 04:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
for now I'd like to just withdraw my
 
04:17:17.269 --> 04:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
motion yeah who made that second I did I
 
04:17:19.590 --> 04:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
will also withdraw okay so that
 
04:17:23.389 --> 04:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
amendment is no longer before us uh so
 
04:17:25.229 --> 04:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
what is the thought is that this also
 
04:17:26.630 --> 04:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
something we're going to continue or we
 
04:17:29.109 --> 04:17:29.119 align:start position:0%
want to continue or yeah that would be
 
04:17:31.710 --> 04:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
um so that we can continue this on the
 
04:17:35.790 --> 04:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
March 20th yeah
 
04:17:35.800 --> 04:17:41.429 align:start position:0%
March 20th yeah
okay

04:17:41.429 --> 04:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:43.030 --> 04:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay well March 20th is getting to be a
 
04:17:44.510 --> 04:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
busier and busier
 
04:17:48.790 --> 04:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
day a long day it's okay okay moving on
 
04:17:53.950 --> 04:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
then uh the next bill up is um
 
04:17:57.389 --> 04:17:57.399 align:start position:0%
1615 representative kofalt I believe you
 
04:18:01.229 --> 04:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:05.070 --> 04:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
motion I do um I have an amendment which
 
04:18:13.269 --> 04:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:13.279 --> 04:18:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
that's

04:18:16.070 --> 04:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:16.080 --> 04:18:29.269 align:start position:0%
 
those

04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
um um so I I'm move ought to pass with
 
04:18:38.189 --> 04:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
amend Amendment
 
04:18:38.199 --> 04:18:40.070 align:start position:0%
amend Amendment
2024

04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
2024
 
04:18:40.080 --> 04:18:41.710 align:start position:0%
2024
881

04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
881
 
04:18:45.109 --> 04:18:45.119 align:start position:0%
H um is there a second second
 
04:18:46.950 --> 04:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant seconds uh
 
04:18:48.149 --> 04:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative cofell do you want to
 
04:18:52.750 --> 04:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion sure so
 
04:18:54.870 --> 04:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
um you may recall that during the
 
04:18:58.469 --> 04:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
hearing um the Bill's original sponsor
 
04:19:02.149 --> 04:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
indicated that the uh his preference
 
04:19:04.349 --> 04:19:04.359 align:start position:0%
actually would have been to repeal the
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
autism registry outright
 
04:19:09.389 --> 04:19:09.399 align:start position:0%
uh the department weighed in and said
 
04:19:12.630 --> 04:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
that they were unaware of anyone using
 
04:19:14.389 --> 04:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
the registry for data
 
04:19:16.910 --> 04:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
analysis um they don't have any
 
04:19:21.349 --> 04:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
objection to repealing it and um I also
 
04:19:24.510 --> 04:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
spoke with two co-sponsors of the bill
 
04:19:28.030 --> 04:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
who also believe that an outright repeal
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
would actually be preferable to the bill
 
04:19:33.550 --> 04:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
that was presented um I think they they
 
04:19:35.590 --> 04:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
didn't go that far with the original
 
04:19:38.429 --> 04:19:38.439 align:start position:0%
Bill simply because they the the prime
 
04:19:40.229 --> 04:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
sponsor didn't think that was
 
04:19:43.510 --> 04:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily achievable uh but having
 
04:19:45.950 --> 04:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
spoken to a number of uh a number of
 
04:19:47.349 --> 04:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
people it seems like this is the
 
04:19:50.469 --> 04:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
preferred option so uh briefly stated
 
04:19:52.109 --> 04:19:52.119 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it repeals the
 
04:19:54.990 --> 04:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
autism registry it repeals rulemaking
 
04:19:57.469 --> 04:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
relative to the autism registry and it
 
04:19:58.790 --> 04:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
directs the Department of Health and
 
04:20:01.510 --> 04:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
Human Services to make reasonable all
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable efforts to destroy the data
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
the individual data records um that
 
04:20:07.990 --> 04:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
means means that they could retain
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
aggregate information total number of
 
04:20:13.429 --> 04:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
people diagnosed with autism in any
 
04:20:15.910 --> 04:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
given year but they would be destroying
 
04:20:19.830 --> 04:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
the the the records that pertain to
 
04:20:21.870 --> 04:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
individuals um you know one of the key
 
04:20:25.109 --> 04:20:25.119 align:start position:0%
concerns here of course is that um it
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
came to light in the in the hearing that
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's a great deal of personally
 
04:20:31.109 --> 04:20:31.119 align:start position:0%
identifiable information in that
 
04:20:33.510 --> 04:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
registry and that nobody is giving
 
04:20:36.510 --> 04:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
consent to be added to the registry uh
 
04:20:39.149 --> 04:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
in fact many of them are not aware that
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
they or their family members are in the
 
04:20:43.189 --> 04:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
registry so for that reason um I bring
 
04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment which modifies the bill
 
04:20:48.750 --> 04:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
to Simply repeal the registry Al
 
04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
together okay any other discussion
 
04:20:51.720 --> 04:20:54.109 align:start position:0%
together okay any other discussion
representative

04:20:54.109 --> 04:20:54.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:20:54.119 --> 04:20:55.870 align:start position:0%
representative
paza

04:20:55.870 --> 04:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
paza
 
04:20:59.990 --> 04:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I I like the intention but um I
 
04:21:02.070 --> 04:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
probably will vote against it because
 
04:21:05.510 --> 04:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about an intended
 
04:21:09.910 --> 04:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
consequences to tax space and uh it
 
04:21:13.990 --> 04:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
could be twofold first of all there's a
 
04:21:16.830 --> 04:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
interest uh if there's a growing problem
 
04:21:20.750 --> 04:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
for example of occurence of
 
04:21:23.830 --> 04:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
autism uh there's a an interesting to
 
04:21:27.149 --> 04:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
figure it out like some would say it's
 
04:21:29.389 --> 04:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
completely not connected for example to
 
04:21:32.349 --> 04:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
vaccination but let's prove it uh yes
 
04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
the HHS maybe not using that registry
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
for this purposes
 
04:21:39.870 --> 04:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe it should so that's
 
04:21:41.670 --> 04:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
concerned that instead of trying to
 
04:21:44.590 --> 04:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
figure out the problem we are destroying
 
04:21:46.189 --> 04:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
data that
 
04:21:49.830 --> 04:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
potentially um uh bring awareness of
 
04:21:52.990 --> 04:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
what's going on and why it's going on uh
 
04:21:54.830 --> 04:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
and the second
 
04:21:59.710 --> 04:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
concern is like receiving Ser services
 
04:22:03.429 --> 04:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
so um potential abuse when
 
04:22:06.990 --> 04:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
person um or family want to receive
 
04:22:10.030 --> 04:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
Services uh for
 
04:22:12.790 --> 04:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
certain uh medical condition but then
 
04:22:15.309 --> 04:22:15.319 align:start position:0%
they also want to receive other
 
04:22:18.510 --> 04:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
services uh uh saying that they don't
 
04:22:22.750 --> 04:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
have this condition so uh having it both
 
04:22:27.189 --> 04:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
ways uh it's second potential unintended
 
04:22:30.349 --> 04:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
uh so uh
 
04:22:34.030 --> 04:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
I I I'm thanking for your effort uh in
 
04:22:39.030 --> 04:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh supporting uh uh uh autism Community
 
04:22:42.910 --> 04:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
uh but um uh for me it's not clear how
 
04:22:46.349 --> 04:22:46.359 align:start position:0%
it will be uh with unintended
 
04:22:48.189 --> 04:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
consequences thank
 
04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
you representative Thomas thank you Mr
 
04:22:55.149 --> 04:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
chair um this is a question for for you
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
um so in in my town we have past
 
04:23:00.670 --> 04:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
contamination and chronic past exposure
 
04:23:03.229 --> 04:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
is is associated with autistic
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
Tendencies so I understand getting
 
04:23:08.670 --> 04:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
getting rid of this list I I agree with
 
04:23:11.109 --> 04:23:11.119 align:start position:0%
it however is there a vehicle that
 
04:23:13.710 --> 04:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
remains in New Hampshire to gather
 
04:23:15.750 --> 04:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
information including personal
 
04:23:17.830 --> 04:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
information on autism so that we can
 
04:23:20.990 --> 04:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
correlate it to
 
04:23:23.309 --> 04:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
exposure thank you for the question so
 
04:23:23.319 --> 04:23:26.710 align:start position:0%
exposure thank you for the question so
I'm

04:23:26.710 --> 04:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:30.670 --> 04:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm not aware of what the Department
 
04:23:34.269 --> 04:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
of Education has in terms of the
 
04:23:37.109 --> 04:23:37.119 align:start position:0%
comprehensive nature of their data and
 
04:23:38.109 --> 04:23:38.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
04:23:41.389 --> 04:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
sure to what extent they're barred from
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
sharing that data
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
um so because the autism
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
registry tracks diagnosis not
 
04:23:56.630 --> 04:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
um it tracks diagnosis so there there
 
04:23:59.469 --> 04:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
are potentially people who lived in a
 
04:23:59.479 --> 04:24:00.429 align:start position:0%
are potentially people who lived in a
certain

04:24:00.429 --> 04:24:00.439 align:start position:0%
certain
 
04:24:03.309 --> 04:24:03.319 align:start position:0%
town were exposed to something and moved
 
04:24:07.109 --> 04:24:07.119 align:start position:0%
or got vaccinated or not and moved
 
04:24:08.429 --> 04:24:08.439 align:start position:0%
it does I guess doesn't it's not
 
04:24:11.149 --> 04:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
relevant in that that case but there may
 
04:24:12.990 --> 04:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
there may or may not be records in New
 
04:24:17.070 --> 04:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of an event that could be
 
04:24:20.030 --> 04:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
correlated um so I guess the short
 
04:24:23.710 --> 04:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
answer is no but I also don't think that
 
04:24:27.670 --> 04:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
the current data necessarily sheds much
 
04:24:29.790 --> 04:24:29.800 align:start position:0%
light on on some of this I think it
 
04:24:31.670 --> 04:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
certainly doesn't shed any light on
 
04:24:34.870 --> 04:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
vaccination uh correlating uh because
 
04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
there's no flag in there
 
04:24:40.510 --> 04:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
currently for what vaccines a child has
 
04:24:44.189 --> 04:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
has received
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
um so I I I guess the biggest concern is
 
04:24:49.030 --> 04:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
04:24:51.710 --> 04:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
the it the registry currently includes
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
the last four of people's social
 
04:24:55.469 --> 04:24:55.479 align:start position:0%
security number it includes the town the
 
04:24:57.550 --> 04:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
age the you know there's there's so many
 
04:25:00.750 --> 04:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
variables that it includes that
 
04:25:03.910 --> 04:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
um a you know a reasonably determined
 
04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
person could could back into you know
 
04:25:09.309 --> 04:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
personally identifying the people on the
 
04:25:12.349 --> 04:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
list um so I I although I certainly
 
04:25:14.269 --> 04:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate the intent behind the
 
04:25:16.550 --> 04:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
question I think the answer is no and
 
04:25:19.830 --> 04:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure that this uh data is
 
04:25:22.469 --> 04:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
would necessarily help I I wonder if
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
there was
 
04:25:27.309 --> 04:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
another I see another hand up over
 
04:25:29.429 --> 04:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
here representative
 
04:25:31.950 --> 04:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
Shapiro I think maybe representative
 
04:25:34.109 --> 04:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
kofalt covered it but when

04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%

that no we can always try and they can
 
04:29:44.790 --> 04:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
pull it off consent if we the RO okay
 
04:29:48.630 --> 04:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%

0573 and sorry I I thank you this should
 
04:30:20.590 --> 04:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
be coffee not water um I would like to
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
move Amendment
 
04:30:24.790 --> 04:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
0573 H and I'll pull that out of my
 
04:30:28.229 --> 04:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:30.550 --> 04:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
it like I said it should be coffee not
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:34.640 --> 04:30:43.389 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

04:30:43.389 --> 04:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:45.950 --> 04:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
we did what did we do we continued it we
 
04:30:49.070 --> 04:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
didn't which one um the safe haven we
 
04:30:51.109 --> 04:30:51.119 align:start position:0%
continued it okay we didn't I thought we
 
04:30:53.950 --> 04:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
were going to discuss another question
 
04:30:55.630 --> 04:30:55.640 align:start position:0%
well we did but they're not ready for it
 
04:30:59.429 --> 04:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
yet another one another one that we had
 
04:31:02.550 --> 04:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be about six bills on
 
04:31:02.560 --> 04:31:03.670 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be about six bills on
that

04:31:03.670 --> 04:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:06.189 --> 04:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
day which is certainly
 
04:31:08.429 --> 04:31:08.439 align:start position:0%
doable but that mean six reports that
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
have to be written right away that
 
04:31:11.040 --> 04:31:13.349 align:start position:0%
have to be written right away that
day

04:31:13.349 --> 04:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:31:17.109 --> 04:31:17.119 align:start position:0%
yes uh we uh that was
 
04:31:21.189 --> 04:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
consent that was an easy one 1712 the
 
04:31:23.189 --> 04:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
amendment um we couldn't do because it
 
04:31:25.189 --> 04:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
was chapter law not statutory so we
 
04:31:30.910 --> 04:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:33.790 --> 04:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
consent uh well Chris you'd like him
 
04:31:34.910 --> 04:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
today right so you can get him in the
 
04:31:40.910 --> 04:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:44.630 --> 04:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:46.750 --> 04:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
that probably they probably won't make
 
04:31:46.760 --> 04:31:48.149 align:start position:0%
that probably they probably won't make
it

04:31:48.149 --> 04:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:31:50.429 --> 04:31:50.439 align:start position:0%
then because they've got to go from you
 
04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
to Paul to the
 
04:31:59.670 --> 04:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
speaker so all right but um yeah I
 
04:32:02.269 --> 04:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know today tomorrow I would
 
04:32:04.670 --> 04:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
guess they I know we have session but
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
Joe yeah we'll go over that so as we get
 
04:32:15.510 --> 04:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
this last build done I'll go over what
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
um and I guess uh if I can get sort of
 
04:32:30.550 --> 04:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
nods or any of that once people have
 
04:32:32.149 --> 04:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
read through this so that I can then
 
04:32:33.309 --> 04:32:33.319 align:start position:0%
talk through it I know I just didn't
 
04:32:35.189 --> 04:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
want to talk while everybody was reading
 
04:32:36.750 --> 04:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
but I guess we have it in front of us
 
04:32:40.149 --> 04:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
now um what one of the concerns had been
 
04:32:43.469 --> 04:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
um other medically necessary conditions
 
04:32:46.389 --> 04:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
so on lines four and five it adds or any
 
04:32:47.870 --> 04:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
diagnosed condition for which a
 
04:32:49.429 --> 04:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
circumcision is deemed medically
 
04:32:51.030 --> 04:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
necessary by a physician or other
 
04:32:52.510 --> 04:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider license in New
 
04:32:55.030 --> 04:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the other concern was
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
regarding the um was regarding the fact
 
04:33:00.910 --> 04:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
that there was prior authorization and
 
04:33:03.550 --> 04:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
uh line seven amends the bill to remove
 
04:33:06.949 --> 04:33:06.959 align:start position:0%
the prior authorization requirement
 
04:33:09.310 --> 04:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
so those were the two main main issues
 
04:33:12.029 --> 04:33:12.039 align:start position:0%
that were raised on um the substance in
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
those areas um which were may not just
 
04:33:16.709 --> 04:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
which would be uh more technical issues
 
04:33:20.789 --> 04:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.429 --> 04:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
differences representative
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
Merchant I want to say thank you to
 
04:33:27.789 --> 04:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
representative Bon for the amendment um
 
04:33:29.470 --> 04:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things I have in my notes and
 
04:33:33.310 --> 04:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
maybe something that is not gerain here
 
04:33:36.189 --> 04:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
it's also for religious reasons
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
so this this is medical what you
 
04:33:39.070 --> 04:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
understand but there could be certain
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
religions that may either require it or
 
04:33:43.390 --> 04:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
want it and so forth is that going to be
 
04:33:46.990 --> 04:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
covered um if I can answer that in my
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
understanding the religious
 
04:33:50.230 --> 04:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
circumcisions don't happen in the
 
04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
hospital the religious circumcisions
 
04:33:53.590 --> 04:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
happen outside of the hospital with a
 
04:33:53.600 --> 04:33:59.510 align:start position:0%
happen outside of the hospital with a
non-medical

04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:59.520 --> 04:34:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
provider

04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
provider
 
04:34:04.349 --> 04:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
okay well okay so then we need to get
 
04:34:05.789 --> 04:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
into the other philosophic
 
04:34:08.949 --> 04:34:08.959 align:start position:0%
question philosophically we have
 
04:34:11.510 --> 04:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
problems with money say education money
 
04:34:13.551 --> 04:34:13.561 align:start position:0%
going to religious institutions when
 
04:34:15.269 --> 04:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
you're looking at this religious thing
 
04:34:17.551 --> 04:34:17.561 align:start position:0%
the question is um you're looking at
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid going for something that's
 
04:34:21.869 --> 04:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
purely religious as opposed to something
 
04:34:23.949 --> 04:34:23.959 align:start position:0%
that has some sort of medical
 
04:34:26.670 --> 04:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
requirement so when you get to a purely
 
04:34:30.070 --> 04:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
religious ritual type um circumcision
 
04:34:31.830 --> 04:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
those ones are absolutely happening
 
04:34:34.230 --> 04:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
outside of the hospital when there's the
 
04:34:36.070 --> 04:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
general leaning just like the times when
 
04:34:39.070 --> 04:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
I filled out on the religious for
 
04:34:41.429 --> 04:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
generic Christian that's what I had
 
04:34:43.029 --> 04:34:43.039 align:start position:0%
filled out you know it's there's the
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
question of there of how closely tied it
 
04:34:46.750 --> 04:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
is so I I don't know if there's still
 
04:34:48.869 --> 04:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
more concern but we're trying to get as
 
04:34:51.590 --> 04:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
much as we can I would say based upon
 
04:34:54.109 --> 04:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
this if I may sure go ahead thank you
 
04:34:56.750 --> 04:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
that you raised a good point in what I
 
04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
lost sight of Medicaid is medical
 
04:35:01.150 --> 04:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
insurance and only can be used for
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
medical reasons so given that statement
 
04:35:06.390 --> 04:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
and what you just said I could support
 
04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:13.310 --> 04:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
Shapiro I was just going to as the
 
04:35:16.470 --> 04:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
committee Jew I was just going to
 
04:35:18.789 --> 04:35:18.799 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
04:35:23.670 --> 04:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
um so um in the Jewish religion is one
 
04:35:27.150 --> 04:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
of the religions along with um Islam
 
04:35:29.109 --> 04:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
where people are
 
04:35:31.949 --> 04:35:31.959 align:start position:0%
frequently circumcised and I I think
 
04:35:33.390 --> 04:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
there's a great
 
04:35:37.070 --> 04:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
variation um frequent ly circumcisions
 
04:35:39.109 --> 04:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
happen in a ritual manner outside the
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
hospital but I think there were a lot of
 
04:35:42.230 --> 04:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
Jews who believe that their children
 
04:35:44.670 --> 04:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
should be certified who may be more
 
04:35:47.429 --> 04:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
secular or might not be having that kind
 
04:35:47.439 --> 04:35:48.310 align:start position:0%
secular or might not be having that kind
of

04:35:48.310 --> 04:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:35:48.320 --> 04:35:49.869 align:start position:0%
of
ritual

04:35:49.869 --> 04:35:49.879 align:start position:0%
ritual
 
04:35:53.429 --> 04:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
um tradition and might have their child
 
04:35:56.109 --> 04:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
circumcised in a doctor's office or um
 
04:35:56.949 --> 04:35:56.959 align:start position:0%
in a
 
04:35:59.629 --> 04:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
hospital to me that's not it's not
 
04:36:02.789 --> 04:36:02.799 align:start position:0%
really the relevant point in terms of my
 
04:36:05.429 --> 04:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
um feelings about the bill in general so
 
04:36:08.070 --> 04:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't really think that that's
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
an issue we should do on representative
 
04:36:12.590 --> 04:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
Seth King thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:36:15.029 --> 04:36:15.039 align:start position:0%
for bringing forth this amendment um I
 
04:36:18.830 --> 04:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
definitely like the part of line seven
 
04:36:22.150 --> 04:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
um by getting rid of that one part that
 
04:36:27.189 --> 04:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
it does um Roman Roman five um I'm just
 
04:36:31.349 --> 04:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
curious K says or any diagnosed
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
condition and I'm just wondering why we
 
04:36:36.830 --> 04:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
leave in all of these these other um
 
04:36:38.869 --> 04:36:38.879 align:start position:0%
specified conditions if we're going to
 
04:36:41.789 --> 04:36:41.799 align:start position:0%
have like a catchall phrase anyways why
 
04:36:44.709 --> 04:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
not just get rid of a through J and then
 
04:36:47.310 --> 04:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
just make K the it's got to be medically
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
necessary why do we have to specify all
 
04:36:50.510 --> 04:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:36:53.869 --> 04:36:53.879 align:start position:0%
ones uh well thank you that that that is
 
04:36:55.349 --> 04:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
definitely one point of being able to
 
04:36:56.789 --> 04:36:56.799 align:start position:0%
just wipe all of those out and say just
 
04:36:59.109 --> 04:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
medically necessary but we also look at
 
04:37:00.349 --> 04:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that we had another bill on
 
04:37:02.470 --> 04:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
informed consent and recognizing that
 
04:37:04.390 --> 04:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
there are medically necessary reasons
 
04:37:06.429 --> 04:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
for circumstance de ision I think just
 
04:37:08.230 --> 04:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
into that whole dialogue that hopefully
 
04:37:10.590 --> 04:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
we don't keep rehashing but into that
 
04:37:12.429 --> 04:37:12.439 align:start position:0%
whole dialogue it does put in statute
 
04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
that there are those required there are
 
04:37:17.070 --> 04:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
those medical reasons for it as well and
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
I think that that just sort of helps in
 
04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
the conversation um nobody really prints
 
04:37:24.349 --> 04:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
out very rarely are the statutes printed
 
04:37:25.750 --> 04:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
out so I'm not going to worry too much
 
04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
about the amount of ink by having those
 
04:37:30.830 --> 04:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
additional lines um and this was one
 
04:37:33.070 --> 04:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
that was proposed by the prime sponsor
 
04:37:36.310 --> 04:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
um AV way to address the concerns
 
04:37:39.470 --> 04:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative uh anagel then Shapero
 
04:37:41.470 --> 04:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I had a
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
question about what's your replacing on
 
04:37:46.150 --> 04:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
Section Five um from the original bill
 
04:37:51.269 --> 04:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:53.230 --> 04:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization um so a
 
04:37:55.150 --> 04:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization is when you need to
 
04:37:57.269 --> 04:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
make sure you get approval before you do
 
04:37:58.789 --> 04:37:58.799 align:start position:0%
something if you're going to get paid
 
04:38:00.590 --> 04:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
for it at least that's my understanding
 
04:38:02.590 --> 04:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
because we use the term prior I've never
 
04:38:04.470 --> 04:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
used the term pre and that's why I was
 
04:38:05.949 --> 04:38:05.959 align:start position:0%
confused by that whether it's a
 
04:38:08.349 --> 04:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization from the patient or a
 
04:38:10.230 --> 04:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization from the
 
04:38:12.629 --> 04:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
insurer um I'm not sure if the language
 
04:38:14.629 --> 04:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
in the bill is the correct language but
 
04:38:17.349 --> 04:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
either way it's gone okay perfect if you
 
04:38:19.551 --> 04:38:19.561 align:start position:0%
answer my question it solve my problem
 
04:38:21.150 --> 04:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:38:24.189 --> 04:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes so I I'm going to vote
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
against this amendment and um it has
 
04:38:29.629 --> 04:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with um religion or
 
04:38:32.230 --> 04:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
religious um exception not being
 
04:38:32.240 --> 04:38:33.910 align:start position:0%
religious um exception not being
included

04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
included
 
04:38:33.920 --> 04:38:35.789 align:start position:0%
included
um

04:38:35.789 --> 04:38:35.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:35.799 --> 04:38:38.029 align:start position:0%
um
you

04:38:38.029 --> 04:38:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
know when one um is um looking for
 
04:38:45.189 --> 04:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
information outside their area of
 
04:38:47.510 --> 04:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
expertise um I don't know about you but
 
04:38:51.750 --> 04:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
I tend to go on the internet and you um
 
04:38:54.510 --> 04:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
one looks and clearly you can find
 
04:38:57.470 --> 04:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
information on the internet that says um
 
04:39:00.830 --> 04:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
circumcision is not only
 
04:39:05.070 --> 04:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary but um is damaging is
 
04:39:08.349 --> 04:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
mutilating the body etc etc um that
 
04:39:11.750 --> 04:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
there are no health benefits but I think
 
04:39:13.269 --> 04:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
most of us would acknowledge that you
 
04:39:15.551 --> 04:39:15.561 align:start position:0%
can also find information that says that
 
04:39:20.470 --> 04:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
there are medical benefits and
 
04:39:23.470 --> 04:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
um so I mean we could argue I don't
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
think we're equipped to argue what which
 
04:39:28.230 --> 04:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
is true or more accurate and um I'm not
 
04:39:30.551 --> 04:39:30.561 align:start position:0%
really interested in that but I would
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
say that in my mind
 
04:39:33.840 --> 04:39:35.510 align:start position:0%
say that in my mind
circumcision

04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
circumcision
 
04:39:38.470 --> 04:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
is not a cosmetic procedure but it is an
 
04:39:41.470 --> 04:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
elective procedure and I do not think
 
04:39:44.590 --> 04:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
that people that boys should get
 
04:39:47.190 --> 04:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
circumcised um I do not think that they
 
04:39:49.550 --> 04:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be circumcised I think it's
 
04:39:52.350 --> 04:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
parent choice I think a reasonable
 
04:39:55.470 --> 04:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
parent could feel that
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
um there is some medical benefit and a
 
04:40:00.670 --> 04:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable parent could feel that it it
 
04:40:02.948 --> 04:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
could be potentially very damaging
 
04:40:04.830 --> 04:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
although in my mind some of the stories
 
04:40:10.350 --> 04:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
that we heard were full of hyperbole but
 
04:40:13.350 --> 04:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
um so I think it is an elective
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
procedure I think um people are doing a
 
04:40:18.708 --> 04:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
good job about educating people and
 
04:40:20.230 --> 04:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
maybe there's more that could be done
 
04:40:23.350 --> 04:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
about in in terms of Education um you
 
04:40:25.628 --> 04:40:25.638 align:start position:0%
know I once again you can read all kinds
 
04:40:28.270 --> 04:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
of rates but I think the rates have come
 
04:40:31.270 --> 04:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
down from like my generation where 85%
 
04:40:33.990 --> 04:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
of of boys were getting circumcised to
 
04:40:36.550 --> 04:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
now it's more like 50% so things are
 
04:40:39.628 --> 04:40:39.638 align:start position:0%
changing the Norms are changing and I
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
think it's probably a good thing and I
 
04:40:45.910 --> 04:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
think it's probably because people um
 
04:40:49.910 --> 04:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
take bodily autonomy more seriously and
 
04:40:52.470 --> 04:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
people do a lot more research into their
 
04:40:55.230 --> 04:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
own Medical Care and so I think that
 
04:40:56.788 --> 04:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
that's probably a good thing and I think
 
04:41:00.030 --> 04:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
education is a good thing however I
 
04:41:02.470 --> 04:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
think that this has been a culturally
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
acceptable procedure
 
04:41:08.430 --> 04:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
um I think it's been one can make the
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
argument that it has medical
 
04:41:15.190 --> 04:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
benefit and I I'm against from an equity
 
04:41:17.948 --> 04:41:17.958 align:start position:0%
point of view um taking that
 
04:41:19.830 --> 04:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement away from low-income
 
04:41:24.350 --> 04:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
people so I would vote no on um ending
 
04:41:27.868 --> 04:41:27.878 align:start position:0%
the coverage Medicaid coverage for
 
04:41:29.910 --> 04:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
circumcision another
 
04:41:33.310 --> 04:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
discussion representative B thank you
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned
 
04:41:38.350 --> 04:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
represent mentioned Islam for example
 
04:41:41.070 --> 04:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
but nothing in this bill that I read
 
04:41:44.510 --> 04:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
says mail there are female
 
04:41:48.470 --> 04:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
circumcisions so I mean so what are we
 
04:41:52.430 --> 04:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
covering here males on females or both
 
04:41:55.590 --> 04:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
and I know Islam had the thing in some
 
04:41:58.830 --> 04:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
countries of female circumcision
 
04:42:02.190 --> 04:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
so we have a problem here I think
 
04:42:02.200 --> 04:42:03.550 align:start position:0%
so we have a problem here I think
representative

04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:42:03.560 --> 04:42:05.590 align:start position:0%
representative
Shapero

04:42:05.590 --> 04:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
Shapero
 
04:42:07.990 --> 04:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
I I believe that we have a New Hampshire
 
04:42:13.270 --> 04:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:16.628 --> 04:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
circumcision yeah I that I don't know
 
04:42:19.708 --> 04:42:19.718 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative
 
04:42:21.788 --> 04:42:21.798 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr
 
04:42:25.868 --> 04:42:25.878 align:start position:0%
chair like my colleague from Keane
 
04:42:28.470 --> 04:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
initially was opposed to this bill
 
04:42:30.750 --> 04:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
because concerned about creating two
 
04:42:34.150 --> 04:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
classes of Medical Care those for the
 
04:42:36.750 --> 04:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
wealthy and those who aren't but given
 
04:42:39.190 --> 04:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that we Chang this to a any
 
04:42:42.270 --> 04:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
diagnostic condition and based the fact
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
based upon the fact that
 
04:42:46.590 --> 04:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid the way it's written is only
 
04:42:48.310 --> 04:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
for medical
 
04:42:50.708 --> 04:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
procedures um I could therefore support
 
04:42:53.550 --> 04:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
the bill particularly with line seven
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
deleting the reference to a prior
 
04:42:57.830 --> 04:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
authorization so I will be in support of
 
04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
the amendment probably for the bill okay
 
04:43:03.830 --> 04:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Nel about the
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
amendment correct not the actual bill
 
04:43:08.948 --> 04:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
because I count issues the bill itself
 
04:43:12.070 --> 04:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
but any other discussion on the
 
04:43:14.510 --> 04:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing none I'll ask the clle
 
04:43:16.190 --> 04:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
to call the rooll the motion is ought to
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%

representative Lon um thank you Mr

chairman I move ought to pass as amended
 
04:44:39.230 --> 04:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
by Amendment uh
 
04:44:42.230 --> 04:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
05738 on House Bill
 
04:44:44.750 --> 04:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
1683 and I will also second that as I
 
04:44:47.390 --> 04:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
did the amendment uh any discussion or
 
04:44:48.788 --> 04:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
04:44:50.350 --> 04:44:50.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you yes I would like to speak
 
04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
very briefly to this motion I'm sure
 
04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
none of you after getting to know me
 
04:44:55.350 --> 04:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
would be surprised to know that I came
 
04:44:57.868 --> 04:44:57.878 align:start position:0%
with binder like this with clinical data
 
04:44:59.868 --> 04:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
when I went to the hospital with my kids
 
04:45:02.990 --> 04:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
so I I recognized the idea and now there
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
was clinical equivalence that was
 
04:45:06.550 --> 04:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
actually something that I supported and
 
04:45:07.990 --> 04:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
I even had to get some exceptions to
 
04:45:11.310 --> 04:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
other things in order to do that um as
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
for the idea about the potential of this
 
04:45:15.830 --> 04:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
being discriminatory um I think that
 
04:45:17.910 --> 04:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
everybody is coming to more awareness of
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
this and
 
04:45:22.590 --> 04:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
I I think that this remains a personal
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
choice and I think that it's one that
 
04:45:27.030 --> 04:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
because Medicaid is for medical reasons
 
04:45:28.788 --> 04:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
any parent who's seeking it for medical
 
04:45:30.310 --> 04:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
reason which you can find in the
 
04:45:32.030 --> 04:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
literature and you can support and if
 
04:45:33.788 --> 04:45:33.798 align:start position:0%
there's a parent who is really saying
 
04:45:35.788 --> 04:45:35.798 align:start position:0%
this is really important to me as
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
they're being informed about the risks
 
04:45:39.750 --> 04:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
and the benefit of the procedure the
 
04:45:41.110 --> 04:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
doctor will tell them about the
 
04:45:43.430 --> 04:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
potential data where they could be fewer
 
04:45:46.230 --> 04:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
UTI if they were to get a circumcision
 
04:45:48.270 --> 04:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
so I feel that any parent who feels very
 
04:45:50.830 --> 04:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
strongly would be able to have a medical
 
04:45:52.788 --> 04:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
indication that they could express to
 
04:45:54.628 --> 04:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
the parent yes that the doctor that yes
 
04:45:56.510 --> 04:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
that is important to me so I feel for
 
04:45:58.990 --> 04:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
those parents who really feel strongly
 
04:46:01.070 --> 04:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
they will have there is CL clinical
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
equivalence at you know at least about
 
04:46:04.670 --> 04:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
it that they'll be able to point to
 
04:46:06.868 --> 04:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
something um my other concern too is
 
04:46:09.110 --> 04:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
that if it's just sort of a a one-way
 
04:46:11.550 --> 04:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
conveyor belt where many where you're
 
04:46:13.150 --> 04:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
finding people who are on private
 
04:46:15.750 --> 04:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
insurance making more stopping and
 
04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
thinking about the decision more than
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
people who are on Medicaid if it's just
 
04:46:20.990 --> 04:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
B basically part of an established
 
04:46:23.150 --> 04:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
pathway that you may see some difference
 
04:46:25.030 --> 04:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
in equity around what the rates look
 
04:46:26.750 --> 04:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
like in the Medicaid population versus
 
04:46:28.990 --> 04:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
the non-medicaid population I don't want
 
04:46:30.628 --> 04:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
to do that study I don't want to look at
 
04:46:33.070 --> 04:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
that study but since Medicaid is for
 
04:46:35.670 --> 04:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
medical reasons and everybody's evolving
 
04:46:37.470 --> 04:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
in their Viewpoint I don't think that
 
04:46:39.708 --> 04:46:39.718 align:start position:0%
it's a discriminatory
 
04:46:42.230 --> 04:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
Bill representative Nagel and then
 
04:46:44.230 --> 04:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thanks Mr
 
04:46:46.470 --> 04:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
chairman since I lost so much sleep over
 
04:46:48.150 --> 04:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
this bill I just wanted to point out a
 
04:46:50.190 --> 04:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
couple things that I think are somewhat
 
04:46:51.910 --> 04:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
less relevant now with the amendment
 
04:46:54.548 --> 04:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
which I actually do like but um this
 
04:46:56.708 --> 04:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
bill only applies to Medicaid so what I
 
04:46:58.430 --> 04:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
I tried to do is figure out well how
 
04:46:59.910 --> 04:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
much does it actually cost to get a
 
04:47:02.510 --> 04:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid circumcision and it's actually
 
04:47:04.390 --> 04:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
you it's a money loser the doctor doors
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
don't make any money doing this the
 
04:47:08.390 --> 04:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
states that have actually done this have
 
04:47:10.270 --> 04:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
seen the rate of Medicaid um
 
04:47:13.190 --> 04:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
circumcisions drop by about 50% and what
 
04:47:14.708 --> 04:47:14.718 align:start position:0%
was really interesting is when they
 
04:47:17.310 --> 04:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
looked at two of those States the
 
04:47:19.590 --> 04:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um reimbursement for
 
04:47:21.750 --> 04:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
circumcision actually increased and the
 
04:47:23.230 --> 04:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
reason why was because they weren't
 
04:47:25.070 --> 04:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
doing it in newborns now they were doing
 
04:47:26.590 --> 04:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
it in three or four year olds when the
 
04:47:28.948 --> 04:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
risk benefit ratios and the cost benefit
 
04:47:31.548 --> 04:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
ratios are a lot less favorable and so
 
04:47:32.830 --> 04:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
they were dealing with a much more
 
04:47:34.750 --> 04:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
expensive much more risk
 
04:47:37.430 --> 04:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
procedure um so if this is supposed to
 
04:47:39.390 --> 04:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
be a money saving Bill I'm not sure
 
04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
anybody's going to be really saving any
 
04:47:43.830 --> 04:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
money by doing it uh by passing this
 
04:47:45.430 --> 04:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
bill and I kind of get the impression
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
that was the reason for the bill in the
 
04:47:49.628 --> 04:47:49.638 align:start position:0%
first place the last thing I did want to
 
04:47:51.430 --> 04:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
point out that I thought was also
 
04:47:53.430 --> 04:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
important that I thought the testimony
 
04:47:55.470 --> 04:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
that we heard for several hours was a
 
04:47:57.310 --> 04:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
little bit misleading and them claiming
 
04:47:59.070 --> 04:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
that this is a cosmetic procedure
 
04:48:01.110 --> 04:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
without any medical benefit and then
 
04:48:02.708 --> 04:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
they cited all the major medical
 
04:48:04.390 --> 04:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
organizations that's not what the
 
04:48:07.150 --> 04:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
medical organization said the American
 
04:48:09.548 --> 04:48:09.558 align:start position:0%
Academy of Pediatrics said that the risk
 
04:48:12.270 --> 04:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
benefit ratio actually favors doing this
 
04:48:15.150 --> 04:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
in the newborn but the the benefit is
 
04:48:17.590 --> 04:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
not sufficient to justify Universal
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation except in a couple
 
04:48:21.150 --> 04:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances which the World Health
 
04:48:24.548 --> 04:48:24.558 align:start position:0%
Organization the CDC vot set followed up
 
04:48:26.150 --> 04:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
on is that if you live in an AIDS
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
endemic area you should do this in a
 
04:48:30.750 --> 04:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
newborn because your risk is unfavorable
 
04:48:32.910 --> 04:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
um if you live in a you know an STD
 
04:48:34.708 --> 04:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
unfavorable environment that you
 
04:48:36.150 --> 04:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
probably should do it because the risk
 
04:48:38.230 --> 04:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
benefit ratio is more favorable in those
 
04:48:40.270 --> 04:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
regards after that I agree it's a
 
04:48:42.230 --> 04:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
personal choice but to this diminish
 
04:48:46.110 --> 04:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
this is genital mutilation and cosmetic
 
04:48:47.670 --> 04:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
is really
 
04:48:49.788 --> 04:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
inaccurate representative Merchant then
 
04:48:49.798 --> 04:48:52.190 align:start position:0%
inaccurate representative Merchant then
representative

04:48:52.190 --> 04:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:48:55.230 --> 04:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chair my
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
understanding of Medicaid I don't have
 
04:48:57.360 --> 04:48:58.230 align:start position:0%
understanding of Medicaid I don't have
the

04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:49:01.110 --> 04:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
um depth of knowledge maybe I should
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
have to make the comment but thing I've
 
04:49:05.350 --> 04:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
learned about
 
04:49:08.548 --> 04:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is it's medical insurance and
 
04:49:10.070 --> 04:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
the only time medical insurance will pay
 
04:49:12.270 --> 04:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
for something with it's private or
 
04:49:14.830 --> 04:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
public is when it's medically
 
04:49:17.110 --> 04:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
necessary if it's something selective
 
04:49:19.310 --> 04:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
and not medically necessary and cosmetic
 
04:49:21.230 --> 04:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
and so forth most private insurance
 
04:49:23.430 --> 04:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
companies along with Medicaid will not
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
pay for it so my concern of having two
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
levels of care based upon that comment
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
basically goes away given the fact we
 
04:49:33.590 --> 04:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't have prior approval or prior
 
04:49:35.990 --> 04:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
authorization ation required anymore I
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable that we are not
 
04:49:41.788 --> 04:49:41.798 align:start position:0%
creating two classes of care um if the
 
04:49:43.190 --> 04:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
medical provider deems it to be
 
04:49:44.750 --> 04:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
medically necessary Medicaid will pay
 
04:49:47.110 --> 04:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
for it if they deem it not to be
 
04:49:48.470 --> 04:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
medically necessary need something
 
04:49:50.590 --> 04:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
selective based upon either religious
 
04:49:53.070 --> 04:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
reasons or other reasons whatsoever um
 
04:49:54.788 --> 04:49:54.798 align:start position:0%
that's really up to the parent to make
 
04:49:56.190 --> 04:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
that choice just like they would with
 
04:49:58.350 --> 04:49:58.360 align:start position:0%
private insurance so I don't think this
 
04:50:00.590 --> 04:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
is going to be a two two-tier system of
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
care representative
 
04:50:02.840 --> 04:50:06.590 align:start position:0%
care representative
chaparo

04:50:06.590 --> 04:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:09.390 --> 04:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
yes I would like to address the equity
 
04:50:12.670 --> 04:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
issue or as representative Leon said the
 
04:50:14.788 --> 04:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
issue of whether it's discriminatory or
 
04:50:19.708 --> 04:50:19.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:22.948 --> 04:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
and I would say that if we pass this
 
04:50:26.110 --> 04:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
bill we're essentially saying that that
 
04:50:29.070 --> 04:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
it's not medically necessary and we're
 
04:50:32.030 --> 04:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
passing a bill to say Medicaid no longer
 
04:50:34.548 --> 04:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
will cover um
 
04:50:37.030 --> 04:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
circumcisions and
 
04:50:40.910 --> 04:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
um now you can read the fine print but I
 
04:50:43.030 --> 04:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
think what we're basically saying to the
 
04:50:46.230 --> 04:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is that this is
 
04:50:48.788 --> 04:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
um this is a procedure that that
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid will not cover anymore and
 
04:50:55.590 --> 04:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
that's the message that we're given um
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
and that it will be left to anybody who
 
04:51:03.190 --> 04:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
is um I mean we don't want it to be that
 
04:51:05.910 --> 04:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
the default def is to kids just get
 
04:51:08.070 --> 04:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
circumcised but we don't want it to be
 
04:51:09.948 --> 04:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
the default that kids don't get
 
04:51:12.150 --> 04:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
circumcised and that a parent has to
 
04:51:14.548 --> 04:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
bring their case to a physician and
 
04:51:17.390 --> 04:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
saying well here's the research here's
 
04:51:20.910 --> 04:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
what I think um is the medical benefit
 
04:51:24.670 --> 04:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
so I think that it is an an equity issue
 
04:51:27.470 --> 04:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
and that we are taking away a coverage
 
04:51:32.150 --> 04:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:36.030 --> 04:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
so I mean I know is I I disagree and I
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
think that I will I will definitely vote
 
04:51:37.920 --> 04:51:39.230 align:start position:0%
think that I will I will definitely vote
against

04:51:39.230 --> 04:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
against
 
04:51:42.310 --> 04:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
this other
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
discussion oh representative Leon um
 
04:51:46.868 --> 04:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and and thank you
 
04:51:49.548 --> 04:51:49.558 align:start position:0%
for that I think that I I think that
 
04:51:51.830 --> 04:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
this isn't something that's about the
 
04:51:53.510 --> 04:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
funding and trying to save money for
 
04:51:55.948 --> 04:51:55.958 align:start position:0%
Medicaid as much as it is to have a
 
04:51:57.990 --> 04:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
discussion that it's not a default one
 
04:52:00.230 --> 04:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
way or the other but it's a discussion
 
04:52:02.430 --> 04:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
so I think that I believe that all
 
04:52:04.788 --> 04:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
families a ball inome levels are capable
 
04:52:06.510 --> 04:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
of having these discussions and talking
 
04:52:08.390 --> 04:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
with their health care provider and that
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
through the whole process especially
 
04:52:12.350 --> 04:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
when you do have a multi-day stay with a
 
04:52:14.110 --> 04:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
with a birth that you have this
 
04:52:16.070 --> 04:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk with your Healthcare
 
04:52:18.390 --> 04:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
team and have a discussion about the
 
04:52:20.708 --> 04:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
need for about the medical reasons
 
04:52:23.990 --> 04:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
behind circumcision um I
 
04:52:26.470 --> 04:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's discriminatory to
 
04:52:28.110 --> 04:52:28.120 align:start position:0%
say that families regardless of their
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
income level are able to make decisions
 
04:52:33.350 --> 04:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
about their child's care and um I know
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is is just one of those areas where
 
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
we just have different approaches to
 
04:52:39.470 --> 04:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
trying to respect people and to respect
 
04:52:41.310 --> 04:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
where they're coming from and I think I
 
04:52:42.548 --> 04:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
don't think that we'll ever come to an
 
04:52:43.948 --> 04:52:43.958 align:start position:0%
agreement on this but I know that we're
 
04:52:45.830 --> 04:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
both coming from this from good good
 
04:52:47.470 --> 04:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
points of view where we're both trying
 
04:52:48.910 --> 04:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
to honor those families and make sure
 
04:52:50.150 --> 04:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
that we're they're protected we just
 
04:52:52.510 --> 04:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
disagree on how to do
 
04:52:54.788 --> 04:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
04:52:59.150 --> 04:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
Palmer so I do think the amendment helps
 
04:53:03.150 --> 04:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
the bill but I'm opposed to the idea uh
 
04:53:05.070 --> 04:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
most of the decisions about what's
 
04:53:06.990 --> 04:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
covered or not are not legislated
 
04:53:09.590 --> 04:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
they're made by groups of people who get
 
04:53:11.310 --> 04:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
together with all the evidence and
 
04:53:14.990 --> 04:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not a procedure is
 
04:53:16.868 --> 04:53:16.878 align:start position:0%
coverage insurance coverage for the
 
04:53:18.430 --> 04:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
procedure whether it's Medicare private
 
04:53:21.548 --> 04:53:21.558 align:start position:0%
insurance or Medicaid and I think the
 
04:53:22.708 --> 04:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
two things
 
04:53:26.470 --> 04:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
that go here is one is that that with
 
04:53:28.708 --> 04:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
more information the trend is is going
 
04:53:31.310 --> 04:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
away from doing C circumcision but I
 
04:53:32.868 --> 04:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
don't think I don't think we should
 
04:53:32.878 --> 04:53:34.948 align:start position:0%
don't think I don't think we should
legislate

04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
04:53:36.788 --> 04:53:36.798 align:start position:0%
coverage I think that the coverage
 
04:53:39.548 --> 04:53:39.558 align:start position:0%
should be decision should be made at you
 
04:53:42.708 --> 04:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
know not not by legislators legislators
 
04:53:44.948 --> 04:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
most of whom like even I don't this is
 
04:53:46.350 --> 04:53:46.360 align:start position:0%
not something I do so I really don't
 
04:53:48.030 --> 04:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
know about it so I don't think I should
 
04:53:50.470 --> 04:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
be deciding
 
04:53:56.430 --> 04:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:59.110 --> 04:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
Shapero um I would just say
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
that that
 
04:54:02.480 --> 04:54:04.430 align:start position:0%
that that
um

04:54:04.430 --> 04:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:07.830 --> 04:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
in in terms of the message to the public
 
04:54:10.230 --> 04:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
we' be passing a bill that says this
 
04:54:12.470 --> 04:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
bill Pro the analysis this bill provides
 
04:54:14.430 --> 04:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
that the State Medicaid plan shall not
 
04:54:14.440 --> 04:54:15.590 align:start position:0%
that the State Medicaid plan shall not
include

04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
include
 
04:54:17.628 --> 04:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
circumcision and then it goes on to
 
04:54:21.470 --> 04:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
unless their exceptions and so I think I
 
04:54:27.390 --> 04:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:30.910 --> 04:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
um I think this is a bill that that will
 
04:54:34.270 --> 04:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
make it very hard for someone to um be
 
04:54:38.070 --> 04:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for this procedure and
 
04:54:40.590 --> 04:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know I don't understand
 
04:54:43.948 --> 04:54:43.958 align:start position:0%
why we're doing that representative
 
04:54:46.110 --> 04:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:54:49.030 --> 04:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
represent chapero I went online just out
 
04:54:51.868 --> 04:54:51.878 align:start position:0%
of curiosity Anthem will only pay for
 
04:54:54.310 --> 04:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
circumcision if it's medically
 
04:54:56.830 --> 04:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
necessary so back to the issue I think
 
04:54:59.470 --> 04:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
we're race faced with here represent
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
Palmer we don't have an insurance
 
04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
company this was an insurance company
 
04:55:05.070 --> 04:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
sitting around the table deciding upon
 
04:55:06.788 --> 04:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
what we want to cover Through the
 
04:55:08.750 --> 04:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
policy and that's how insurance
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
basically Works however because we don't
 
04:55:13.470 --> 04:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
have a corporation per say we are in a
 
04:55:16.230 --> 04:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
sense the corporation legislatively so
 
04:55:18.230 --> 04:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
we have to decide legislatively what we
 
04:55:20.270 --> 04:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
want to put into the policy that we
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
cover for Medicaid patients so that's
 
04:55:24.590 --> 04:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
where that's where I'm coming from and I
 
04:55:26.910 --> 04:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
looked at Anthem a lot of the other ones
 
04:55:28.788 --> 04:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
they don't pay for it unless it's
 
04:55:31.230 --> 04:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
medically necessary so what I'm trying
 
04:55:32.708 --> 04:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
to make an argument for is that we're
 
04:55:35.788 --> 04:55:35.798 align:start position:0%
following the free market as well so
 
04:55:37.830 --> 04:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
somebody unfortunately was going to be
 
04:55:39.310 --> 04:55:39.320 align:start position:0%
an Anthem because they made too much
 
04:55:41.628 --> 04:55:41.638 align:start position:0%
money going to Medicaid they could have
 
04:55:43.110 --> 04:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
the procedure done at least be paid for
 
04:55:45.868 --> 04:55:45.878 align:start position:0%
by somebody else representative bmer and
 
04:55:48.548 --> 04:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
then representative sharo but I I wonder
 
04:55:50.310 --> 04:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
how an Anthem would respond if we
 
04:55:55.708 --> 04:55:55.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:59.470 --> 04:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
not respon representative it it's a good
 
04:56:02.310 --> 04:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
it's a good point I hear but we're not
 
04:56:02.320 --> 04:56:03.948 align:start position:0%
it's a good point I hear but we're not
legislating

04:56:03.948 --> 04:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
legislating
 
04:56:05.310 --> 04:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
who should we turn it over to the
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Human Services and
 
04:56:08.150 --> 04:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
agency let them decide what the policy
 
04:56:09.470 --> 04:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
should be someone's going to make a
 
04:56:12.270 --> 04:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
choice about the policy and there's no
 
04:56:13.990 --> 04:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have a corporation to make that
 
04:56:16.190 --> 04:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
decision so how do we do it otherwise
 
04:56:18.868 --> 04:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
How would how would you do
 
04:56:18.878 --> 04:56:20.510 align:start position:0%
How would how would you do
it

04:56:20.510 --> 04:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:56:23.470 --> 04:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
representative well so Medicare makes
 
04:56:26.030 --> 04:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
its own decisions I mean why don't we k
 
04:56:29.230 --> 04:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
i I mean I I'm just saying we we can't
 
04:56:31.788 --> 04:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
as a legislative body to sit down and
 
04:56:34.030 --> 04:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
take all of the medical diagnos noes and
 
04:56:35.548 --> 04:56:35.558 align:start position:0%
decide which ones we're going to pay for
 
04:56:37.830 --> 04:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
we're not qualified to do that maybe we
 
04:56:39.868 --> 04:56:39.878 align:start position:0%
need maybe there needs to be you know a
 
04:56:42.390 --> 04:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
commission or something a group that
 
04:56:44.750 --> 04:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
does that for Medicaid I don't know to
 
04:56:46.350 --> 04:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
be honest I don't know how it works now
 
04:56:48.990 --> 04:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
but I I just don't like the idea of
 
04:56:51.670 --> 04:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
starting to take pieces of
 
04:56:54.070 --> 04:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
it and and you know who knows what the
 
04:56:55.548 --> 04:56:55.558 align:start position:0%
next one will be where Medicaid's not
 
04:56:57.390 --> 04:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
going to pay for bypass surgery now I I
 
04:56:59.868 --> 04:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
don't know representative
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
Leon um thank you I'm just trying to
 
04:57:04.470 --> 04:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
find the
 
04:57:08.948 --> 04:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
um see where it is so we were we were
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
discussing something similar to this
 
04:57:13.470 --> 04:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
earlier today on House Bill
 
04:57:16.030 --> 04:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
1568 where we were talking about adding
 
04:57:19.910 --> 04:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
more coverage to Medicaid um and I was
 
04:57:21.390 --> 04:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
corrected that it's not Commerce it is
 
04:57:23.910 --> 04:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services so we are the
 
04:57:26.948 --> 04:57:26.958 align:start position:0%
body we are the ones who decide how
 
04:57:30.310 --> 04:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
State revenues are used in the Medicaid
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
Program and which services to provide so
 
04:57:35.310 --> 04:57:35.320 align:start position:0%
so um I mean honestly maybe at some
 
04:57:36.628 --> 04:57:36.638 align:start position:0%
point the Health and Human Services
 
04:57:38.110 --> 04:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
committee if that becomes a bigger thing
 
04:57:39.390 --> 04:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
can act like Commerce and have
 
04:57:40.868 --> 04:57:40.878 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that are dedicated to
 
04:57:43.150 --> 04:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
medicate coverage and then we can get
 
04:57:45.310 --> 04:57:45.320 align:start position:0%
that expertise but this seems to be
 
04:57:47.030 --> 04:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with what's happening in the
 
04:57:48.510 --> 04:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
market and perhaps having that
 
04:57:50.350 --> 04:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
consistency is the least discriminatory
 
04:57:54.270 --> 04:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:58.470 --> 04:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
chapero um several weeks ago regarding a
 
04:58:01.590 --> 04:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
different bill I had the um opportunity
 
04:58:04.070 --> 04:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
to speak to Rob Barry who is the um
 
04:58:06.510 --> 04:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
attorney for Medicaid for Department of
 
04:58:09.430 --> 04:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I was actually
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
asking about coverage for other things
 
04:58:11.760 --> 04:58:13.110 align:start position:0%
asking about coverage for other things
like

04:58:13.110 --> 04:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:58:17.548 --> 04:58:17.558 align:start position:0%
cosmetic breast reductions and um breast
 
04:58:19.868 --> 04:58:19.878 align:start position:0%
augmentation and he made it clear that
 
04:58:21.510 --> 04:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
those things Wen uncovered and what he
 
04:58:24.510 --> 04:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
said to me is Medicaid only covers
 
04:58:27.070 --> 04:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
medically necessary
 
04:58:30.070 --> 04:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
procedures that is already that is
 
04:58:33.510 --> 04:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
already the case and the fact is is that
 
04:58:36.390 --> 04:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
they consider this a medically necessary
 
04:58:38.350 --> 04:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
procedure so I don't know why we're
 
04:58:43.150 --> 04:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
taking this one issue and
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
interceding on behalf of
 
04:58:50.910 --> 04:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
um this one particular issue and one
 
04:58:53.030 --> 04:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
particular advocacy group that has
 
04:58:54.590 --> 04:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
strong feelings about this one
 
04:58:57.110 --> 04:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
particular issue I think the policy of
 
04:58:59.270 --> 04:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid New Hampshire Medicaid is
 
04:59:01.590 --> 04:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
already that it's only covers medically
 
04:59:03.750 --> 04:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
necessary procedures
 
04:59:05.430 --> 04:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
think we starting to go on in circles a
 
04:59:07.990 --> 04:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
little bit here repeat ourselves unless
 
04:59:09.470 --> 04:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
somebody has up something new why don't
 
04:59:10.990 --> 04:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
we go to the
 
04:59:14.990 --> 04:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
vote any anything new I'm not saying it
 
04:59:17.628 --> 04:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
all right so the motion is a to pass as
 
04:59:21.788 --> 04:59:21.798 align:start position:0%

05:03:03.430 --> 05:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
desire to look at
 
05:03:03.440 --> 05:03:04.788 align:start position:0%
desire to look at
uh

05:03:04.788 --> 05:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%

about those bills be an ad Haw meeting
 
05:03:12.310 --> 05:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
this is not going to be formal it's just
 
05:03:14.708 --> 05:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
going to be us working offline okay
 
05:03:17.948 --> 05:03:17.958 align:start position:0%
thank you anything else no
 
05:03:19.868 --> 05:03:19.878 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
05:03:21.548 --> 05:03:21.558 align:start position:0%
chairman uh my thought would be that if
 
05:03:23.510 --> 05:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard back from the clerk and
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
speaker but um we'll probably my guess
 
05:03:27.868 --> 05:03:27.878 align:start position:0%
would be we'd try and figure figure out
 
05:03:30.430 --> 05:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
how to fit it in within our normal uh
 
05:03:31.628 --> 05:03:31.638 align:start position:0%
yes we need to have a hearing on the
 
05:03:34.430 --> 05:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
amendment so shall we look to do that
 
05:03:37.350 --> 05:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday um maybe 10 o' or or
 
05:03:39.910 --> 05:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
after lunch if um depending on what the
 
05:03:39.920 --> 05:03:40.948 align:start position:0%
after lunch if um depending on what the
schedule

05:03:40.948 --> 05:03:40.958 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
05:03:46.628 --> 05:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:49.070 --> 05:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
afterwards right we were hoping we I
 
05:03:50.230 --> 05:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to come in just with the
 
05:03:53.430 --> 05:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
one bill yeah please so I I know I guess
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
the question is um since we're not just
 
05:03:57.750 --> 05:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
doing it as a okay then um I guess so
 
05:03:59.670 --> 05:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
we'll have we'll have six bills to exec
 
05:04:02.990 --> 05:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
plus that hearing right yes um so then
 
05:04:05.070 --> 05:04:05.080 align:start position:0%
the question would be how the thing is
 
05:04:06.868 --> 05:04:06.878 align:start position:0%
with six bills to exact with that being
 
05:04:08.390 --> 05:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
a deadline those reports have to be in
 
05:04:09.868 --> 05:04:09.878 align:start position:0%
that day because the deadline is the
 
05:04:13.948 --> 05:04:13.958 align:start position:0%
21st so so they have to be done that
 
05:04:17.350 --> 05:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
day uh 9:30 not usually 9:30 works for
 
05:04:19.390 --> 05:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
everyone or do we start at 9: with the
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
hearing on that we can do 9 that's even
 
05:04:23.548 --> 05:04:23.558 align:start position:0%
better executive session starting at 9
 
05:04:24.670 --> 05:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
again everybody wouldn't have to be here
 
05:04:26.910 --> 05:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
at 9: for the hearing that
 
05:04:28.990 --> 05:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
works why don't we why don't we start at
 
05:04:33.390 --> 05:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
9ine on the 20th then okay um
 
05:04:35.350 --> 05:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro is someone going
 
05:04:37.190 --> 05:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
to write the amendment or have the
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
amendment written prior to the hearing
 
05:04:42.110 --> 05:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
which the well it's actually on the
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that's already done right so
 
05:04:45.470 --> 05:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
um we can do it on the here Amendment
 
05:04:47.030 --> 05:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's already done if we were to add
 
05:04:49.948 --> 05:04:49.958 align:start position:0%
any Ru making or the injectables um
 
05:04:52.030 --> 05:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
those would still be gerine to what we
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
have now so but but since we're doing it
 
05:04:56.910 --> 05:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
the same day it seems like someone
 
05:04:59.430 --> 05:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
should have that Amendment written
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
definitely seems that way that would be
 
05:05:02.910 --> 05:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
helpful if there's anything you wanted
 
05:05:05.430 --> 05:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
to write or that representative be no
 
05:05:08.030 --> 05:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
continu volunteering I'm just saying
 
05:05:09.910 --> 05:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
you're volun told there will be no
 
05:05:12.110 --> 05:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
continues that day because they have to
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
be done that talking about that needs to
 
05:05:15.750 --> 05:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
have something written anything else
 
05:05:18.510 --> 05:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
sorry representative TZ my question was
 
05:05:20.030 --> 05:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
which which Bill are we talking about
 
05:05:24.510 --> 05:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:27.270 --> 05:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
day yes the one that we had that large
 
05:05:30.110 --> 05:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that um the speaker has ruled
 
05:05:31.948 --> 05:05:31.958 align:start position:0%
um that it's non remain so we should we
 
05:05:34.390 --> 05:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
need to have a non gerain hearing um
 
05:05:35.788 --> 05:05:35.798 align:start position:0%
we've already discussed most of those
 
05:05:37.390 --> 05:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
issues so as long as there's nothing
 
05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
that comes up and makes us realize that
 
05:05:41.150 --> 05:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
this is a big problem I don't see a
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
problem with us doing it on the 20th
 
05:05:44.948 --> 05:05:44.958 align:start position:0%
then um and then if we realize that
 
05:05:46.990 --> 05:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
we're we've we've uh drifted into a m
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
field then we adapt with that Madam Vice
 
05:05:52.548 --> 05:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
chair yes can we maybe only schedule 15
 
05:05:54.590 --> 05:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
minutes for that that day instead of 30
 
05:05:55.990 --> 05:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
that way we can start on the executive
 
05:05:57.788 --> 05:05:57.798 align:start position:0%
session at like 9:15 instead of having
 
05:06:00.750 --> 05:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
to wait just in case we probably could
 
05:06:02.230 --> 05:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
but we probably wouldn't be scheduling
 
05:06:05.110 --> 05:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
the executive session until 9:30 anyways
 
05:06:07.470 --> 05:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
so if we started at 9: so that we can do
 
05:06:09.628 --> 05:06:09.638 align:start position:0%
that um that way if it is a little bit
 
05:06:12.990 --> 05:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
longer um I'd be uncomfortable starting
 
05:06:18.030 --> 05:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:21.190 --> 05:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
okay just just one note when I wrote
 
05:06:23.788 --> 05:06:23.798 align:start position:0%
most of anything else yeah when I wrote
 
05:06:26.310 --> 05:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
most of the education blur we used to
 
05:06:28.190 --> 05:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
call them years ago I had them all
 
05:06:31.190 --> 05:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
written before the hearing before the
 
05:06:33.830 --> 05:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
exec session
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
our executive sessions can be very
 
05:06:39.868 --> 05:06:39.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:42.670 --> 05:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
noted anything else if not we stand
 
05:07:01.310 --> 05:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:01.320 --> 05:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
no
