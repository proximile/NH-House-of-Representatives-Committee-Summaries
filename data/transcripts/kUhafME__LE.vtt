00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.270 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
um okay so I can only assume we're
 
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
online but I I've actually actually
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
talked to Terry about getting the camera
 
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
have the red light so we know whether
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
the camera is on or not but um so
 
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully hope that'll hopefully no
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
there is no red light
 
00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
evidently it's an extra so hopefully
 
00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 align:start position:0%
we'll get that taken care of
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
okay what's our first whe this is oh the
 
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
the fun one right5 all
 
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
right okay so we have an amendment in
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%

we'll explain section by section okay uh
 
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
I think we'll when don't we I guess um
 
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 align:start position:0%
the first question I have is there
 
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
anybody in the audience who um is
 
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
concerned or as problems or anything we
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
need to know up front about
 
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
645 okay good that's what that's what I
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to see I can introduce news is
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
good news all right so okay so we have a
 
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
presentation yeah and I have like some
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
opening remarks if you want yeah right
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
what's that represent
 
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
spe you couldn't hear me when you face
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
that way I couldn't tell what you were
 
00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:14.879 align:start position:0%
saying what are we going to be doing
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
with 645 we uh the we will hope that we
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
will be passing this amendment we're not
 
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
going to talk about the new Amendment
 
00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:24.759 align:start position:0%
first that that's what we're going to do
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a presentation on
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
what the new Amendment says okay well if
 
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard no no I was more
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
worried about anybody in the audience
 
00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:37.639 align:start position:0%
who has uh had any concern with this
 
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
bill at the moment so that that we knew
 
00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:42.879 align:start position:0%
ahead of time if there was going to be
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
problems but if that but they haven't
 
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
seen the
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
amendment uh but the am the amendment's
 
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
been floated around yeah so but we'll
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
find out they may not have seen it they
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
may not have seen it okay so they may
 
00:07:58.029 --> 00:07:58.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
true okay
 
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.360 align:start position:0%
all right you're on Keith
 
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you Mr chair uh so I'll
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
just give an opening high level overview
 
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%
of what we're talking about here because
 
00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:13.479 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is New Territory for uh
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions um this concept of a of a
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
DA uh utilizes
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
technology uh to allow for Collective
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
action okay so a lot of the concepts are
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
very old
 
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
um uh governance right so the state
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
itself uh is similar to a dow right so
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
people vote on their represent
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
representatives and then we sit on this
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
committee and we vote on proposals and
 
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
those proposals are called bills right
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
and our vote determines the outcome of
 
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.590 align:start position:0%
and our vote determines the outcome of
that

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
process um so what a dow does is utilize
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
technology to capture that in in a in a
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
a form where it's it's cryptographically
 
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:04.360 align:start position:0%
provable quick um would you mind moving
 
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
your mic closer contr here thank you
 
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
how's that thank you did you hear me so
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
far yeah thank you so what kind of tools
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
do you need well if you know how to use
 
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
a web
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
browser and you know how to install a
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
plugin if you know what a plugin is for
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
a web browser you pretty much have all
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
the tools you need to participate in a
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
dow and some of the newer web browsers
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
have this functionality built right into
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
it so it's not uh
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's not something very esoteric it's
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
becoming more easily uh usable so what
 
00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
we could do if we if we wanted to I
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
could open my laptop I could create a I
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
could create a
 
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
dow and it would yeah I could right and
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
I could give each of us a a an
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
ID like an nft you probably heard the
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
term nft we could each have a way to
 
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:55.240 align:start position:0%
prove who we are and then we could
 
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.190 align:start position:0%
prove who we are and then we could
submit

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
submit
 
00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
proposals which could be a bill or
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
something like that and then the the
 
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
system would track our votes and
 
00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
determine the outcome and it's all open
 
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
on a blockchain it's all publicly
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
viewable and and auditable and it's
 
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
immutable can't those those votes can't
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
be changed so that's just to give you
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
like a way to think about it um and so
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment is an attempt to give a
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
DA legal
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
personhood so there's Dows being created
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
this minute all over the internet all
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
the time some of those organizations
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
some of those Collective actions may
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
become the next Facebook Google meta
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
they may be become that big in the
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
future and so what this bill is trying
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
to do and other states are doing it
 
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
other states have done it is give a give
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
the ability for a DA group of people
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
acting collectively on the internet a
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
way to register with the state to have
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
conferred upon it some of the the same
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
things that llc's and corporations and
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
other other legal entities have so why
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
would the Dow want to do that uh number
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
one to limit their
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
liability so we have we have limited
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
liability here when we make decisions
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
we're protected by the state that we
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
can't be sued for our votes
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
right does that make sense so we're when
 
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
you confer limited liability onto a
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
corporation we're Frank franchising what
 
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
we have onto that entity that's
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
basically what we're doing and um the
 
00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
reason why a dow might want to do it one
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
for limited liability so that they can't
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
be sued they can only lose their
 
00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:45.079 align:start position:0%
investment just like you just like you
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
do with an LLC and then also to
 
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
interface with the legal system so Dows
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
can hire employees and they can give
 
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
those employees benefits and there are
 
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
other Dows that those DS can interact
 
00:11:59.629 --> 00:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
with to provide those those services
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
this ecosystem is being built right now
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
on the internet so um that's you know
 
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
one reason is to interact with with the
 
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
legal system own a have a bank account
 
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
own own real
 
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
property and uh I invited someone to
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
come if we have time to have them speak
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh Kumar if you could just raise your
 
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
hand Kumar can talk to us about how
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
tokens can interact with uh with real
 
00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
world assets so that's tokenization of
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
real world assets that's a separate but
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
related topic but a d can do that D can
 
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
own a token that represents a a real
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
world asset so um what this amendment
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
does and we're going to walk through
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
it is it takes definitions from model
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
law there's a a group called koala and
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
they're they're lawyers all around the
 
00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
world working on this that's what we
 
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
started with that's what we heard back
 
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.230 align:start position:0%
started with that's what we heard back
in

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
February so then we've got input from
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders and we pulled in
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
existing statutes some of it from
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
existing LLC law to kind of round out uh
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
to kind of fit that model law into the
 
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
the current framework in in New
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it's a detailed subject as
 
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
you can see by the stack of this
 
00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:22.519 align:start position:0%
presentation but it's it's very
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
interesting and it's uh we're kind of at
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
the Forefront of uh a new way for people
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
to collectively Act
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
and also have some ownership over that
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
action so there's there's complaints
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
about corporations that only a few
 
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:37.959 align:start position:0%
people make the decisions only a few
 
00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
people own the assets what a dow does is
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
allows lots of people to participate in
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
those decisions and and have a little
 
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
piece of of ownership so it's it's an
 
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.870 align:start position:0%
piece of of ownership so it's it's an
exciting

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
exciting
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
topic so any questions so far no it
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
sounds like he's your need can turn on
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
yeah sounds like he he's talking about a
 
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
Union I'm sure a union could use it yes
 
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
you could create a union with a do was
 
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.670 align:start position:0%
you could create a union with a do was
the

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
question it sounds like he's trying to
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
create a union or it sounds like a union
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
a union union yes you could I'm all
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
for I I I do have a question okay
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
yes I was going to recognize need an
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
next so okay represent thanks um
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative could you give us an
 
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.230 align:start position:0%
representative could you give us an
example

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
of a real life um um G that that's
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
operating right now just to kind of give
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
us a real real life example yeah so Dows
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
can be used for a lot of things so um
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
one of the first uses was uh something
 
00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:46.519 align:start position:0%
called decentralized Finance so you've
 
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
probably heard of defi that's a new
 
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
fairly new term um but a
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
decentralized uh a defi system would be
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh A system that operates in computer
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
code that people can use to trade one
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
token for another so like one token that
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
represents an asset for another token
 
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
and you know it's sort of like how the
 
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
stock exchange works so that's that's
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
kind of an early example but there's
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
more recent examples where there's a dow
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
that is for the film industry so they're
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
crowd sourcing and crowdfunding the
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
development of new movies and they're
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
selling Advanced tickets to those movies
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
the ticket is an nft and when they make
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
the movie they you can use the nft to to
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
watch the movie or get special extra
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
features and that could replace
 
00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
Hollywood at some point right so there's
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's possible right um so there's
 
00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:42.759 align:start position:0%
there's you know there's a dow that is
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
funding um military equipment and food
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
and uh you know resources for victims in
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
the Ukraine so there's there's something
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
called the Ukraine D so that' be a
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
philanthropy D so there you know there's
 
00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:00.759 align:start position:0%
uh many more examples happening it's
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's a experimentation and the cream
 
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
kind of Rises to the top right so a lot
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
of dows may not be
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
successful um but eventually you know
 
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
the best ideas rise to the top got
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
followup um can you give me one example
 
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
of scenario where it might be um a dow
 
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to phrase this um a dow would
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
be um dangerous either to security or to
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
an investor yeah uh so Define dangerous
 
00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
right I'm be used to uh um um uh
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
subsidized terrorists or um that kind of
 
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
thing or somebody um loses their money
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
and and are not don't have a secure
 
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
investment like you know Mr Mr freed
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
who's who's going to jail for the rest
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
of his life yeah so that that wasn't a
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
dow okay actually there's a point that
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh if FTX had been a dow and registered
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
in a state that would have provided more
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay protections to the participants so
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
FTX is a centralized offshore system it
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
it dealt with digital tokens that's true
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
but it's not related okay so what about
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
funding terrorists for example uh with a
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
dow I mean if it was caught doing that
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
the in the bill the AG would uh
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
eliminate their legal protections okay
 
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
so I mean the idea is that now we
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
actually have a structure in the state
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
to go after them right
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
then so that's I to me that was one of
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we're doing this so
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative spear yeah okay you'll be
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
next I haven't seen the uh the latest
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment but I've gone over the old the
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
other the last previous amendment in a
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
great deal great deal of detail and it
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
it looks pretty pretty okay to me but
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
there were two things that I didn't
 
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
really quite figure out what was
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
happening the Dow was going to be
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
registered with uh
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
unh's uh iol
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
lab is that a contract that you see that
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
the state is going to have with UNH and
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
who pays for that because there's no
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal note with any of this so I don't
 
00:18:16.149 --> 00:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
get the idea of how that relationship is
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to happen and I had a second
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
question after that yes I I can address
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
that so uh in in the original state
 
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
budget there was1 and A5 million dollar
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
for UNH to to develop blockchain
 
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
capabilities so that would have but the
 
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:33.640 align:start position:0%
Senate I haven't noticed the Senate
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
pulled it out oh so there may be other
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
funding for UNH but this amendment it
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
does reference UNH the interoperability
 
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
lab which is a great place to tour if
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
you want to go see um yeah if you're
 
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:47.799 align:start position:0%
computer geek it's a NE place oh so
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
you're not going to specify yeah so we
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
backed away just made it more generic
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
and there's uh the last page of the bill
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
talks about the Secretary of State
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
putting it out for an RFP we we may have
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
a few wrinkles to work out with that
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
exact process but and it could end up
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
being UNH interoperability lab but um
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know we'll we'll open it up to bid
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
that's the idea my second question or
 
00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
maybe it's an opinion I don't
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
know so I looked at a bunch of other
 
00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
Dows and one of the a dow that's like
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
out there that's kind of typical for
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
stable coins is
 
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.870 align:start position:0%
stable coins is
makerd

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
makerd
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
and they are actually develop they have
 
00:19:30.909 --> 00:19:30.919 align:start position:0%
their own cryptocurrency they have
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
dieses and that one die equals a dollar
 
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
and all all that kind of stuff whatever
 
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
right but what I see in other
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
countries and I haven't looked at the
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
states and I have not so I'm lack on
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
that is the notion that a DA has to have
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
some in the legislation for the DA has
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
to have some notion of that the Dow has
 
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.029 align:start position:0%
to have some notion of that the Dow has
to

00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
implement anti-terrorism funding
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
techniques and which I think are K kyc
 
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
know your customer kind of thing and the
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
other one for anti
 
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
um money
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
laundering yes so those are still open
 
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
questions uh with a so we didn't do
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
anything with that yet no but all other
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
federal and state laws would still apply
 
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
to it now so it doesn't just like if you
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
created an LLC and you were financing
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
terrorism you uh you'd still be you know
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for that
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I do see it explicitly said like in
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
Switzerland and the UK and other places
 
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
so the our banking statutes if if a dow
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
was involved with
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
banking uh our banking statutes would
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
apply to the Dow if if it was in that in
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
that area of if so if you look at the
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
end of the so is it like being
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in I mean is it that you
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
choose the state that they're choosing
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
when you create this that you are going
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
to be uh administrated by this statute
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
by by the the right the laws of New
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because most corporations have
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
that on their documents they say I'm
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
sorry so most corporations you'll see in
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
the fine print you know all that stuff
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
they they you can't barely read but you
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
can it's in there it says at the end of
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
the day if you want to sue them where
 
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
what court what court you sue them under
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
in other words if there is a problem
 
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
they're being administered by exate
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
they'll have a state in most cases you
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
know Corporation at Delaware what I'm
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
concerned about specifically is is if we
 
00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:30.039 align:start position:0%
don't say
 
00:21:33.149 --> 00:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
something does that put the state
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
forgetting about the doubt does that put
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
the state in a liable St situation no
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's the state is this it just means
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's going to come to our state court so
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
if you if that's a liability that for
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
the state courts to have to handle the
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
case but at the end of the day then then
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
the person you know the two people who
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
are suing each other are going to be
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
paying for the their court case you it's
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
not the state it's not you know we're
 
00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
not you know it's not it's not the uh I
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
don't think it's Attorney General's
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
office that's going to be pursuing the
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
case unless you know unless it was
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
clearly a class action suit or some kind
 
00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:06.039 align:start position:0%
of suit that was related to the
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens but uh I'm worried
 
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
about it the feds go after us not
 
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
worried about somebody suing us oh yes
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
they do well feds would feds would go to
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
a federal court anyways yeah okay they
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
would ignore state
 
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
courts you feel comfortable with it
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
that's fine with me yeah no I I'm very
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
excited about
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
this so I just want to point you to page
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
18 line
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
22 on which version on the the one that
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
you have printed out in front of you I
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
think the one that was handed
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
out so it's um just I should it's
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
amendment number unapproved amendment
 
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
number 2327
 
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
H so page
 
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
18 line
 
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
22 in the
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
amendment all right that's
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
helpful that's helpful
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
so just read it real quick application
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
of other laws for avoidance of any doubt
 
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire D shall be subject to
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
all other applicable laws of the State
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire including laws
 
00:23:09.149 --> 00:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
regulating Securities activities Banking
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
and Financial activities Taxation and
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
all other provisions of law
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
so right that's one of the improvements
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
that we made that was one of the
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
Herbert you need to turn your microphone
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
on and pull nice and my first question
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
is um I have trouble with the English
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
decentralized a Dao is a decentralized
 
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.470 align:start position:0%
decentralized a Dao is a decentralized
autonomous

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
autonomous
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
organization so um I'd like to know what
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
autonomous means in in in this
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
particular uh
 
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
usage and decentralized I would like to
 
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
know what that means to the pro you know
 
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.029 align:start position:0%
know what that means to the pro you know
promoters

00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
promoters
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
and um is there a political ideology
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
involved here what's the
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
philosophy right democracy because to me
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
decentralized autonomous is almost a an
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
oxymoron not to me I mean okay so I'm
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
going to be the the the neite in the
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
room on this one okay okay all right
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
autonomous is uh any Corporation any
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
entity is autonomous it has it
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
Standalone it's autonomous by itself yep
 
00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
so decentralized is saying is that like
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
when we think of most corporations well
 
00:24:38.269 --> 00:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
you got to start with the top who's the
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
chairman of the board or who's the CEO
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
and decentralized means no we don't have
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
that corporate structure it's
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
decentralized so that every member of
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
this Dow is equal there is no CEO
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
there's no one person so that's what
 
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
that decentralized autonomous means to
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
me that that can be one version there's
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
some definitions in the bill that that
 
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
might be helpful on page two line 20 is
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
decentralized autonomous organization so
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
that's the beginning of a definition but
 
00:25:12.669 --> 00:25:12.679 align:start position:0%
uh the real meat of it is on page three
 
00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559 align:start position:0%
line 18 it talks about a decentralized
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
governance system and that that has some
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
thresholds built in it so that one
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
person can't control have an outsize
 
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
controlling stake of the organization so
 
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
I'll just want to make one one uh Nuance
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay you mentioned maker so maker has a
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
stable coin which is a token that
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
represents a dollar and they they manage
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
it so that one die is worth $ one dollar
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
constantly it doesn't fluctuate like
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
other but they also have a governance
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
token and what we're talking about is
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
the governance token right so the
 
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
governance token gives you rights over
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
what decisions that organization makes
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
and so when you look at page three line
 
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
decentralized governance system that's
 
00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
really the the token that gives people
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
the ability to to collectively make
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
decisions if that makes
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
sense representative Burrows yeah I just
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
I have a concern which is that I mean
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
this is a complicated thing it's a
 
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
19-page document which we just got
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday I don't know about anybody
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
else I got back from California I didn't
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
even see this till this morning
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
and we haven't had a chance to discuss
 
00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
it people who read it and well we're not
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
we're not executing this bill no I know
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
but it and the bill came out according
 
00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
to this on the 10th of October so it
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
would have been nice we're not going to
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
ex I understand that but it would have
 
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
been nice if we had had an opportunity
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
to go through it this was available
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon about 4:30 I know
 
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
and I didn't see this is a work session
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
so we're not I understand Kei but it
 
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
would have been nice if we gotten it
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
before we could dis all discuss it with
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
some intelligence it wasn't possible I'm
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
sorry so what we will do is we will have
 
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
another subcommittee when if if we're
 
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
November so if we're still aiming for
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
the November 7th exact session which we
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
don't have to right because we have
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
another week after that right don't we
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
so we do but it I would certainly say we
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
can set up for the exact session to be
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon and then have uh the
 
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
the subcomittee uh in the day before or
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
in the morning and and which time if the
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
if concerns have are coming forward we
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
will know it I mean I I mean at the end
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
of the day you we don't have to pass
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
this this year if you really want a wait
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
a year simply because you you know
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
there's so many pages here that's fine
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
we can we can be patient you know uh you
 
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
know Rome wasn't built in a day okay so
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
so I I sorry that we're just getting
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
this now um but that yes we can that I
 
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
will absolutely give plenty of time to
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
for everybody to thrash it out and since
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
I will be out of out of country next
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
week you have a whole time to stir up
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
all the trouble you want in figuring out
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
what you want to do with this and then
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
when we get I get back we can then see
 
00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:09.559 align:start position:0%
where we're at at that time okay so I I
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that you feel that this is
 
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
being just well I me frankly we get a
 
00:28:16.509 --> 00:28:16.519 align:start position:0%
lot of things like this the day before
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
it's happened before so that's my
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
concern so if I can interject Mr ch um
 
00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
we we do have a presentation that we
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
could go through um and it would explain
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
a lot of the questions that people are
 
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
asking represent M um just I still don't
 
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
quite understand how this is structured
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
and how it functions and Keith you said
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
you uh representative um let's say you
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
you formed a a business or a doop with
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
all of us um and you're you're going to
 
00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:47.590 align:start position:0%
all of us um and you're you're going to
make

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
widgets do we invest money to be a
 
00:28:53.549 --> 00:28:53.559 align:start position:0%
member of
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
this so the answer is it depends right
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
so the governance tokens that give you
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
the ability to make decisions that they
 
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
can be given away freely if you want if
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
you wanted to do that or it could be a
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
membership based thing where you pay you
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
know dues and and if if somebody has
 
00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:11.799 align:start position:0%
more tokens than another person do they
 
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
have more say you seem to say that it
 
00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
was uh that was probably not the case
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
but if I'm I'm relating it to a
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
shareholder yeah a shareholder who's got
 
00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:22.519 align:start position:0%
more shares has more say does that work
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
here so again it depends it would be how
 
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
the dial is structured so you could have
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
a token based voting system or the more
 
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
tokens just like the more shares gives
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
you more votes or you could have like a
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
non-transferable nft where it's like a
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
digital ID just for you and then each
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
person would have the same number of
 
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
votes so depend on how the dial got
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
structured a quick followup then but you
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
got to come up with the money to start
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
your widget Factory where does that come
 
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
from uh just so that would be like real
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
world things you know things happening
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
in the real world so just like any
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
company you need Capital to to do that
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
right so you vestures at that level but
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
a dow doesn't need to inter a dow can
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
interface with the real world it doesn't
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
have to depending on what its goals and
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
purposes so it's all in their bylaws
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
right okay all right so um I assume that
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
you want to see Bill AR's
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
Bill

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Mr chairman members of
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Bill ardinger

in my personal
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
capacity uh and and not as a lobbyist on
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of any client I am at times a
 
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
lobbyist who's registered on behalf of
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
clients um but in this case I am
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
performing this uh presentation in my
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
capacity is Bill ardinger who was uh the
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
chairperson of Governor sununu's
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
commission to study digital assets and
 
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency which issued its final
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
report in December of last year and one
 
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
of its
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations was that New Hampshire
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
should enact a legal entity law for
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
these decentralized autonomous
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
organizations and you have before you
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
something that came over the email to
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
the committee but also printed out this
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
morning a PowerPoint presentation from
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
that I have prepared working with
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon that provides a
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
section by section summary of the
 
00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
amendment that you also have before you
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
um and uh but before I really go into
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
that I want to take one deep breath back
 
00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:57.789 align:start position:0%
that I want to take one deep breath back
to

00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:57.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
the reason for this important
 
00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:06.919 align:start position:0%
bill um things are changing out there
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
the commission concluded that um these
 
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
structures blockchain which is a type of
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
software used across the internet the
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
internet itself is relatively new from
 
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
the 60s forward my friend there from
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
digital was working with early stages
 
00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
from when we testified on this bill in
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
in the spring um and right now the
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
choice for
 
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
lawmakers is whether to
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
allow those developments to go on
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
without adequate legal
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to support them or to
 
00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
provide a balanced thoughtful
 
00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.190 align:start position:0%
provide a balanced thoughtful
precedent-based

00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
precedent-based
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
legal structure that will try to
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
encourage and provide stability to these
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
organizations that they go forward
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
representative spear asked the most
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
important question which is hey if we
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
create this legal
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
structure are we
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
facilitating uh and represent bur crime
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
terrorism bad things
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
and my answer would be directly the
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
opposite and this is what the commission
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
found after studying for seven eight
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
months is
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
that there's a divide that we're
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
suffering right now there's the
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
technically proficient World which is
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
very fastel with software with the
 
00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
internet with these structures and then
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
there's the legal system which is
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
backward it is not yet upgraded this is
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
an old story I'm looking at
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
representative hunt
 
00:34:01.389 --> 00:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
in in I've worked with you many ye many
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
years over the years with um situations
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
where developments in our economy our
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
private economy were moving so fast that
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
our laws got stale and then incomes
 
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
lobbyists for Industries and
 
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholders working with agencies to
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
try to upgrade those laws and legal
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
systems we've done that New Hampshire
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
did with corporate law through the 1800s
 
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
and that took a long time but
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately the innovation in the legal
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
system of providing legal
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
personhood to these corporate entities
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
along with limited liability for
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
shareholders which is when you invest
 
00:34:54.669 --> 00:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
your money $1,000 for stock your house
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't also get exposed to law losses
 
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
that Innovation started in a General
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
Corporate Way in New York state in 1811
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
it created some Scholars
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
argue the force and power of the growth
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
of the United States economy to the
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
point where we became a leader in the
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
world we've done this with
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
llc's we've done this with statutory
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
Investment Trust we've done this with
 
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
cooperatives they never had a legal
 
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
system until the legislature took it
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
upon themselves to upgrade their laws to
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
provide this in this case before you you
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
have a situation where there's a
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
community out there in the world who say
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
there's no laws governing me we're new
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
we're on the internet we're software
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
therefore we don't have to comply with
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
the Securities laws we don't have to
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
comply with kyc we don't have to comply
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
with other requirements this exists but
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
when when states are proactive and start
 
00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%
recognizing this economic activity with
 
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:04.839 align:start position:0%
sound legal
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
structures the answer becomes
 
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
representative spear that section that
 
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
Keith just quoted that was a an
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
improvement that happened since the
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
original presentation of the bill it is
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
because there are stakeholders who are
 
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
not just technically proficient people
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
they're aate agencies that care a lot
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
about the jobs that they have and they
 
00:36:30.309 --> 00:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
many of them had served on the
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
commission with Keith and me and others
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
so with that background I would just say
 
00:36:38.589 --> 00:36:38.599 align:start position:0%
that the presentation goes through
 
00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:40.839 align:start position:0%
Section by section what this bill does
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
in summary what this bill does is pick
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
and choose Provisions that this
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
legislature has already adopted some of
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
them I've had a hand in drafting over
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
the years as a lobbyist things like
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
statutory invest M trust I testified in
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
front of this commission years ago we
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
needed it why because it was going to
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
bring to this state Economic Development
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
sound and jobs from the mutual fund
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
industry and it did I also sat in front
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
of this commission to urge uh this
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
committee to urge modernization of trust
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
laws representative hunt suffered
 
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
through those presentations that bill
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
was four times as long as this one but
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
it has had a modernization effect that
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
has been beneficial not only to industry
 
00:37:34.349 --> 00:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
but also to people who want to do things
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
like established trust for their pets
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
this is modernization and I stand before
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
you sit before you today to say what
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
this bill does is by looking at preceden
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
in our law it recognizes the
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
uniquness of this activity which is it's
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
happening not in a way that appoints
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
directors and appoint a CEO with a
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
centralized corporate structure other
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
states are making that mistake as they
 
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
try to upgrade their legal Plumbing to
 
00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
provide uh and support sound development
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
in this industry this bill recognizes
 
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
that the newness of these entities is
 
00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
happening in interactively among
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
decentralized computers all over the
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
internet without an active internet
 
00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:27.319 align:start position:0%
these organizations couldn't be there in
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
this way that is because of the internet
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
this is a progressive use of the
 
00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
internet to provide potentially a
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
structure that can make innovations that
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
are really important to humans May these
 
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
organizations perform activities that
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
are not good for society just like
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
corporations but if you make clear that
 
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
your laws that are sound and that they
 
00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.270 align:start position:0%
your laws that are sound and that they
apply

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
to these organizations perhaps you will
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
be part of the innovations that like New
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
York started in 1911 in 1811 with
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
corporations that ended up with Delaware
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
having you know a significant part of
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
their State's economy operating on sound
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
legal entity laws is it boring yes is it
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
nerdy yes but it's really important the
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
plumbing in your bathroom the granite of
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
your countertop the fixtures are
 
00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
beautiful and they're fun to look at but
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
guess what they don't work without
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
plumbing and that's what this bill is
 
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
part of so I won't go any further other
 
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
than to say as a chair of the commission
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
who spent nine months working with
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
experts and others and agencies I
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
believe this is important for the state
 
00:39:46.309 --> 00:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
to take a lead role in another change
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
I'll close with representative spear in
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is with discussions with
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders the effective date of most
 
00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
of the operative sections of this bill
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
is now set for January 1 2025 under the
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
amendment before you it the only section
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
that becomes effective immediately is
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
the one that instructs the Secretary of
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
State's office to develop procedures and
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
protocols uh for how this unique
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
registry would work and who would
 
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
operate it as a registration Authority I
 
00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:23.079 align:start position:0%
will last say that the unit UNH
 
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab is a gem
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
in this state they are used by every
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
structure in the world's internet
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
economy to test how their software
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
interacts with others on the internet if
 
00:40:41.309 --> 00:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
this legislature and it almost did the
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
governor was very supportive of it it
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
didn't happen because we have to have
 
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
priorities in the budget I was a
 
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
legislator in 1980 and 81 for cornish
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
and cuden I know those prioritizations
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
are tough but we have the possibility in
 
00:40:56.589 --> 00:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I believe with with the
 
00:40:59.550 --> 00:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
combination of uh Innovative legislation
 
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.589 align:start position:0%
combination of uh Innovative legislation
like

00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
this with Incredible knowledge of a
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
governmental organization like UNH
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab just giving it a
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
little bit of help we could be the
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
leaders in bringing these structures
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
into the modern economy and I think we'd
 
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
benefit as a state our families our
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
economy would thank you for I'm sorry I
 
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
didn't walk through the PowerPoint but
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
it's there in front of members to look
 
00:41:25.599 --> 00:41:27.190 align:start position:0%
it's there in front of members to look
at

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
especially since we obviously want to
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
take some time to go through this yes
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
anyways so yes representative
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
burrow thanks for that great
 
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
presentation I really you really made it
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
um easy to follow I appreciate that um
 
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
because I'm not a nerd well I am but not
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
not specifically in terms of this so um
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
if there was let's say a hypothetical
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's a large corporation in New
 
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could they morph into this
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
this um this structure to govern that's
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
a great question and it focuses on in my
 
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
view the real distinction here
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
corporations are by their very nature
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
structures that use Central authorities
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
to make decision in this bill there are
 
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
definition definitions in order to
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
qualify for the registry the New
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire registry which would be the
 
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
first in the in the country this kind of
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
registry it you have to have a
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
decentralized governance system and a DE
 
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
centralized um structure what that means
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
is no one force person group May
 
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
unilaterally change the rights of every
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
other participant and it's it they're
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
based on definitions in federal
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
legislation so in my view a corporation
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
which is a centralized by its nature
 
00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
would never be able to convert to this
 
00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
because to do so they'd have to fire
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
their CEO they'd have to fire their CFO
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
they'd have to adopt a c calization
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
structure that may have real legal
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
agents in the world the the the physical
 
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
world like a DA could appoint me to
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
accept service of process if someone
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to sue it which right now doesn't
 
00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:13.559 align:start position:0%
exist it's and it's a very mess at the
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
federal level there are cases unraveling
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
which this kind of thing would solve but
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
they're everyone struggling with the
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
uncertainty so no representative I don't
 
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
believe a corporation would be able to
 
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
morph into this unless it wanted to give
 
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
up its fundamental corporate
 
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
structure um so do you see this as a
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
viable option for a new company forming
 
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
to go with this structure I I
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
do uh I am a tax nerd and I'm 63 years
 
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
old I am not as technically proficient
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
as I would like to be there is something
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
out there in our economy that is
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
building off of the incred incredible
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
innovation of the internet that is
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
allowing uh cross
 
00:44:03.839 --> 00:44:05.950 align:start position:0%
allowing uh cross
jurisdictional

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional
 
00:44:08.109 --> 00:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
collaborations to happen in ways that
 
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
they never did in the 80s when I was a
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
young lawyer right so I think the answer
 
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
is this is coming there will be younger
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
people than me who will see the benefits
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
of this I already just met a a friend
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
that that Keith brought in who's working
 
00:44:30.549 --> 00:44:30.559 align:start position:0%
in this space and and uh he who is
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
technically proficient sees the benefits
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
of this um I think that this could be
 
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
creates uh organizations that are
 
00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
incredibly Bene beneficial to people all
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
over the world not necessarily limited
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
to a particular jurisdiction but rather
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
I can imagine at one use of blockchain
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
that was cited as a very positive
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
development from a witness who was very
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
skeptical of some of the current
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
structures like FTX which is under
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
indictment you know bankruptcy now is is
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
is she said this structure can be used
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
to efficiently allow people who are
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
doing well in an economy like the United
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
States legally to transfer dollars to
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
their families in other right now the
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
International System takes gigantic fees
 
00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
on those International transfers this
 
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
could be rolled out in a way that is not
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
that is you know going to be a real
 
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
Innovation that helps families worldwide
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
not you know so we have not yet seen all
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
of the creativity of these uses but by
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
upgrading the legal
 
00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.270 align:start position:0%
upgrading the legal
Plumbing

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
Plumbing
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully new remember in this case
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
right now Dows don't have to register
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
publicly anywhere their code actually is
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
online it is accessible but the
 
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
governmental status of the entity is
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
uncertain this requires in order to get
 
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
the benefits of the statute just like
 
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
corporations you have to register with
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Secretary of State
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
just like in other entity so that
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
transparency you have to in order to
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
qualify for this you have to post your
 
00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
code you have to post written bylaws
 
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
that a lay
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
person can understand we all know bylaws
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
are hard to so yes I think I think this
 
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
could be the basis for something
 
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
positive and with good agencies like we
 
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
have in this state Dr Securities banking
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
AG consumer
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
protection I'm hopeful that the
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
development will happen in a way that is
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
helpful to people and they will help
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
ensure in all in addition to the
 
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
transparency and openness that's
 
00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
required ensure that negative stuff is
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
minimized so you're saying I'm not going
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
to be alive to see this because I'm
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
older than you uh I think representative
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
Burrows you and I are going to be alowed
 
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
to see this I don't know that we will be
 
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
the leaders who will be implementing
 
00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
this with code on the internet because I
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
think we'd have to learn a lot before we
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
got there unless you have a lot of free
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
time yeah representative
 
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.309 align:start position:0%
time yeah representative
mcair

00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
mcair
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh you're obviously very uh
 
00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about this stuff and I my
 
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
question is you do you see any if you
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
looked into the future do you see any
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
shortcomings that this um potentially
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't address I mean again things are
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
going extremely fast we're just catching
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
up but is there is there something
 
00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
missing or something that that is is
 
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
going to happen in the future that uh uh
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to catch up some
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
more on the answer
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
is is number one yes but I'm going to
 
00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
tell you why it's a good thing that we
 
00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
pass this bill the LLC didn't exist in
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
the United States until the late 70s
 
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
Wyoming was a leader New Hampshire
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
didn't adopt the LLC law until the early
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
90s um I was part of that adoption has
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
the LLC law in New Hampshire been
 
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
amended many times since it was
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
originally conceived in the first
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
Statute in Wyoming that was adopted yes
 
00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
sir are those amendments bad or
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
indicative that the original bill should
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
not have been enacted absolutely not it
 
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
was with out without that original
 
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
initiative to say and signal to the
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
world that we are intending to be uh
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
establish a legal stable environment for
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
this development we would not have had
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
the benefits that LLC law has provided
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
but yes sir there's going to be
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
amendments to this bill and to others
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
across the country for years to come it
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
will not settle the developments will
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
but we will at least catch up a little
 
00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
bit with what's going on in the world
 
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.470 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
Herbert

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
Herbert
 
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm in
 
00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
politics so I'm right here we're doing
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
politics and I I have yet to understand
 
00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
exactly the
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
philosophy that is generating all of
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
this I can
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
understand that technology is going
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
always has been going so fast I mean AI
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
is all the rage and uh uh but but you
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
need a philosophy a political philosophy
 
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
in order to have me or and I think most
 
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
people be
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
comfortable uh in what you're trying to
 
00:49:50.789 --> 00:49:50.799 align:start position:0%
do now when when I said autonomous
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
autonomous means you regulate
 
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
yourself decentralized means that I I am
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
deregulated I am
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
autonomous I have a problem with that
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
concept because it sounds exactly like a
 
00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:08.799 align:start position:0%
Libertarian philosophy and I have a
 
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
problem with Libertarians so that I'm
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
this is a political argument so when I
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
asked you or I don't know I don't know
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
if I asked you but my question was
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
somebody please give me the
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
philosophy behind it now you're giving
 
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
me a little taste of it
 
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
in the sense that uh I can see where in
 
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
the speed of the world now um I'm not
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
sure that having everybody do their own
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
thing uh is the right way to go I
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
actually you know armies are centralized
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
corporations are
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
hierarchical okay and now you're talking
 
00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:51.640 align:start position:0%
flat land and I'm going gez I'm not
 
00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.750 align:start position:0%
flat land and I'm going gez I'm not
quite

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
quite
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
sure uh that this philosophy is going to
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
work right everybody's doing their own
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
thing and then you come in and say well
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
no the laws here will be adhered to okay
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
autonomous okay you can be an
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
independent but you have laws around you
 
00:51:21.069 --> 00:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
to protect us and that's
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
politics and so I'm coming at it from
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
that point of view I need to be
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
persuaded that uh this is a what the
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
philosophy behind all this is and and so
 
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
I can understand where we might be
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
headed representative Herbert I
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate your question I can imagine
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh a a libertarian view saying you know
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
I don't need laws about private property
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
I don't need laws regulating private
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
property in the in a in a caricature
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
sense I don't think this is accurate and
 
00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:01.799 align:start position:0%
and what you answer back is without laws
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
about filing a piece of paper with the
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds in counties
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
nobody has clear private property
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
without a legal
 
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:17.720 align:start position:0%
system you don't have the things that we
 
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
hold dear in this country these private
 
00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:22.839 align:start position:0%
rules I would say to you uh
 
00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:25.799 align:start position:0%
representative the corporate law
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
does not have a political philosophy it
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
is it is something that enables
 
00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
individuals to come together there are
 
00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:37.640 align:start position:0%
corporations whose leaders are very
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
strong uh Progressive registered
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
Democrats there are leaders of
 
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:45.799 align:start position:0%
Corporations who are very strong uh free
 
00:52:45.799 --> 00:52:47.190 align:start position:0%
Corporations who are very strong uh free
market

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
Republicans it is not the legal
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that enables and
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
clarifies the legal status of that
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
corporation that comes at it from one
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
way or another in this case having sat
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
for nine months on the commission and
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
learned about this what I found is that
 
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
you have political personalities from
 
00:53:10.589 --> 00:53:10.599 align:start position:0%
all across the Spectrum just like every
 
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
human endeavor who are taking advantage
 
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
of these Technologies to deliver
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
services and products and opportunities
 
00:53:22.829 --> 00:53:22.839 align:start position:0%
to individuals who want to come together
 
00:53:26.349 --> 00:53:26.359 align:start position:0%
for that stated purpose the only problem
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
now is that when they come together
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
nobody knows what the consequences are
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
legally so the this law is not tilting
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
one way or another I would submit uh
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
respectfully representative that your
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
reading of autonomous as unregulated in
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is absolutely wrong it's not
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
this creates a transparent legal system
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
like the corporate law like the LLC law
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
like the statutory Investment Trust law
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
like the Cooperative law like the trust
 
00:54:05.789 --> 00:54:05.799 align:start position:0%
law that says New Hampshire state laws
 
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
are modern and they facilitate sound
 
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
Economic Development and growth for the
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
benefit hopefully of people who live in
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
this jurisdiction and I think that it is
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
these this is not political this is
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
about a balanced legal structure that
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
can be used by human beings trying to
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
achieve their goals like the American
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
dream sounds great and uh I need the
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
details and I think I would urge you you
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
have had a chance if you take sorry
 
00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.710 align:start position:0%
have had a chance if you take sorry
sorry

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
sorry you have to know is that he has in
 
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
the past voted against all
 
00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
blockchain I I'm sorry I'm sorry if I
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
had my good friends here who are I've
 
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
worked it three years from the lobbing
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
group they would have been slapping me
 
00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
in the back of the head with that
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge but I care deeply about your
 
00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
comment I I think you you actually hit
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
the nail on the head when you say it is
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
RA really re when it comes to a
 
00:55:11.789 --> 00:55:11.799 align:start position:0%
Libertarian yeah this is
 
00:55:11.799 --> 00:55:13.109 align:start position:0%
Libertarian yeah this is
anti-libertarian

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
anti-libertarian
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
because Libertarians would say is they
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
don't want any laws they wanted to be
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
the wild west out there they wanted to
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
be a freefor all so what's decentralized
 
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.750 align:start position:0%
be a freefor all so what's decentralized
mean

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
let's Okay so let's let's just say that
 
00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.309 align:start position:0%
let's Okay so let's let's just say that
these

00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
words these are just words okay and
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes when I read a bill and they
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
have and have these other references and
 
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:39.640 align:start position:0%
I have no idea where they're coming from
 
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
with us it do so I would say is forget
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
about the title forget about these words
 
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
think in your mind what we're about to
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
do here is very similar to the LLC
 
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
statute which was we are now in creating
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
a new incorporation
 
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle that is different okay it is
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
definitely different than in the other
 
00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
incorporation vehicle that we've had
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
right we start out with s corpse you
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
know or B Corps and then s Corps and we
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
even have B corporations you know which
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
are promoting to suppos to be um
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
politically correct and you know doing
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
you know sound environmental things is a
 
00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:19.799 align:start position:0%
Bor believe it or not so we we passed
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
that in the Hampshire okay so this in
 
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
llc's all of that is every we have
 
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
different structure so in this room we
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
have the Secretary of State we have our
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
Corporation division here okay and
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
they're saying is that that no
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
libertarian would ever intentionally
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
want to be registered with
 
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
them okay we are forcing them to be
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
registered and by we're doing it by the
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
forces is we are attracting to them to
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
have this structure to give them that
 
00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
Integrity wherever business is doing it
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
so that they are not criminally involved
 
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
criminals don't like laws right
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
criminals if you want to do a criminal
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
activity you would not want to be in
 
00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:08.359 align:start position:0%
thisor crypto do some washing but this
 
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
is not crypto well okay is a lot of the
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
langu language I understand the
 
00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:17.039 align:start position:0%
blockchain concept makes it feel that
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
way but at the end of the day the most
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
important thing is is that you have to
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
register with the
 
00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
state well I heard that okay that's that
 
00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
takes that takes all exactly all the
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
other stuff that you your fear of
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
blockchain is that we now you have to be
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
known you have to have there's bylaws
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
that are up on the web you have to have
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
all your rules and regulations and what
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
you're doing has to be public
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
information representative spe is
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
next so and this is for Anita's benefit
 
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
I guess uh I spent a lot of time over
 
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
the summer going through this in
 
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.230 align:start position:0%
the summer going through this in
excruciating

00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
excruciating
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
detail and the dowo community and crypto
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
Community is a little bit like the wild
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
west right now and the idea that we have
 
00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
some really thought through thought out
 
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
laws and uh
 
00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:15.559 align:start position:0%
registration Tech uh this whole thing
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
the whole the bill I think is a terrific
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
idea because
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
it it's going to H whether we want it to
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
or not D exist
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
and by the way I found dozens of
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
different kind of dows on the internet
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
Dows that rent apartments Dows that buy
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
land dials that buy art dials that
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
create art uh dials that create money uh
 
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies Dows that exchange uh
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
stock uh portfolios all kinds of things
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
and if we don't get some laws around
 
00:58:49.119 --> 00:58:49.870 align:start position:0%
and if we don't get some laws around
this

00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
stuff and make it so that it's
 
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
controllable to the extent that we're
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
not taking advantage of constantly and
 
00:59:00.029 --> 00:59:00.039 align:start position:0%
investors can actually invest in these
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
things and not end up like uh FTX and
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
Sam bankman freed and lose eight billion
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
dollar overnight we have to have this we
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
have no choice we have to do this the
 
00:59:14.349 --> 00:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
technology is moving whether we like it
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
or not so we get to get our heads around
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
it and it is a little complex but it's
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
not that bad it really isn't that bad
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
and hey you know I know I do read
 
00:59:27.069 --> 00:59:27.079 align:start position:0%
automobile manuals for
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
fun so for me this is really not any as
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
bad as
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%

answer any questions you have I haven't
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
had a chance to read through the new
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment but I did read through and we
 
01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time in our department
 
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
discussing the um previous amendment to
 
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
this one so we are happy to work with
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
the committee um if you think we are the
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
the best um um Department to organize
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
this and I think it does make a lot of
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
sense um we would be happy to do that I
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
did um speak with the sponsor about the
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact to our department and that
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
there might be a fiscal impact um we
 
01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:23.559 align:start position:0%
would need to have some uh expertise in
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
this area to help us out to especially
 
01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:29.799 align:start position:0%
create the RFP for this uh I can see um
 
01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
us creating a blockchain registry for
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
this which would also be um some I
 
01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
believe something first the nation to
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
create a blockchain registry for the
 
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
purpose of blockchain or Dao um
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
companies um anything else you want to
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
add um no other
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
the okay better go um uh the in terms of
 
01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:57.160 align:start position:0%

01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
and also served previously in that job
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
for for four years
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
okay um yeah the uh in terms of the the
 
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
the the new uh duties that have been um
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
added in the the current the new
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment are certainly things that this
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
office certainly has um the ability to
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
do certainly say we we need some to
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
bring in some some expertise certainly
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
from the technology side but um our
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
ability to find out exactly and analyze
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
what other jurisdictions are doing Sly
 
01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
been following this very closely uh in
 
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
the various uh developments with regard
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
to Doos around the country I know that
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh let say Utah's law will go into
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
effect in January and they're currently
 
01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
building a a process to to be able to
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
register Dows I know Virginia has been
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
working on this as well and I said so I
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
think we're You Know It uh we can't we
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
can't move too quickly in terms of being
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
able to be able to um provide a a
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
structure here that's uh going to be um
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
helpful in terms of uh be able to to
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
identify these these these entities we
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
first started with the original Bill
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
there was there really wasn't any en any
 
01:03:08.269 --> 01:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
structure entity structure there in
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
terms of the fact that um we creating a
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
new um business registry but again on on
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
a blockchain um concept is very exciting
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
to to us certainly and uh the um the
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
fact that we'll have a place where when
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
someone wants to create a dow they'll
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
start out by first inting their intent
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
to do so but filing with a notice with
 
01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
us at the Secretary of State's office
 
01:03:28.269 --> 01:03:28.279 align:start position:0%
we'll Ure they have a registered agent
 
01:03:30.269 --> 01:03:30.279 align:start position:0%
for service of process um and then they
 
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
move forward with the accreditation
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
authority to to meet all the
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
requirements of the Dow so I think
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
that's a very uh interesting concept
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
certainly should be should be certainly
 
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
workable for
 
01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
us okay questions
 
01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.069 align:start position:0%
us okay questions
from

01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
Herbert u i I need to to see like you
 
01:03:59.230 --> 01:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
said the llc's only came around out of
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
Wyoming of all places but apparently
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
Wyoming is uh into this and um I'm not
 
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
uh at all comfortable at this point with
 
01:04:14.029 --> 01:04:14.039 align:start position:0%
the uh Concepts here they sound good uh
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
or in a vague way i' still I've still
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
don't I mean the Providence of
 
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency was
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
crime so uh that's that's I'm I'm I am I
 
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh is who what does this come from you
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
know why is there suddenly this
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
huge uh push in order to rewrite our
 
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.589 align:start position:0%
huge uh push in order to rewrite our
laws

01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:40.599 align:start position:0%
laws
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
decentralized which has a connotation
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
for me and autonomous also has a
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
connotation for me and um and
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
libertarian fits I see red flags go up
 
01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.710 align:start position:0%
libertarian fits I see red flags go up
everywhere

01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
now how long do you
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
think it will take in order to because
 
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
this has been two years and they're
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
working really hard trying to get things
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
together how long would it take to make
 
01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.390 align:start position:0%
together how long would it take to make
me

01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
comfortable that there is some control
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
here that there is this is not this is
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
not something you that uh um you know
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
the government has a responsibility to
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
the citizens I don't want to put them in
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
danger I sounds good what's a token a
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
token was a ticket a ticket we already
 
01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
have now a token goes through the
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
internet and maybe it make becomes real
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
fast and doesn't cost as much and I'm
 
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with that but
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
um I I know I just know from
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
experience that the ones
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
that go like like that and say man I
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
know what I can do with
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
this are not are not honest people and
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
that's why I I'm very worried
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm not at all satisfied at
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
this point and I'm just trying to get
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
something from you when are you going to
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
be able to satisfy me then is this no
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
this is it's going to take a while
 
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
because this is this is complicated
 
01:06:20.829 --> 01:06:20.839 align:start position:0%
stuff um yes I can just like said I
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
don't not sure that I can I can be I'll
 
01:06:24.029 --> 01:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
be the that will satisfy your con
 
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
concerns but um one of the thing that
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
that we find attractive about the about
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
the the bill is that for example anyone
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
who's going to create it out number one
 
01:06:33.269 --> 01:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
is going to create file an intent to do
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
so so our Bureau of security is going to
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
know from the get-go when someone is
 
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
creating a dow they can look at the
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
structure they can see the bylaws they
 
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
can see the process if they are if they
 
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
fall into the definitional Securities
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to register
 
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to be regulated so
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
from that perspective I think we feel
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
pretty comfortable that it won't be
 
01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
$1,000 form the first year it's going to
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
be a small growing process but it will
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
allow our our our infrastructure to be
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
able to identify these folks see how
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
they're organized and then be able to
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
follow through to make sure they're
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
following the banking laws the
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
Securities laws insurance laws whatever
 
01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
is applicable
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
um the one thing too about about these
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
entities which which um I also find very
 
01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
rep positive from a consumer point of
 
01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:14.839 align:start position:0%
view is that right now if you form an
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
LLC after you form the LLC the only
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
information you have to give us is the
 
01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
name of one of your members or or a
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
manager we don't know who all the owners
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
of the LLC are we don't know what their
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
operating agreement is we don't have any
 
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
information about there's no
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
transparency there with a DA everything
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
is completely transparent if we to see
 
01:07:34.349 --> 01:07:34.359 align:start position:0%
the process that decisions are being
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
made by by The Entity as well as if they
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
appoint any administrators the names of
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
those persons are going to be on the web
 
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to know exactly who the
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
people are that are behind the the the
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh the Dow in terms of taking any
 
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
actions on their behalf so there's a
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
great deal of transparency that makes it
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
available to Consumers whether they're
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
members of the Dow or not which we also
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
think is pretty attractive for because
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
view representative Spear and then
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
represent just just a quick comment
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between a DA and
 
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
these laws the Dows are out there
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
whether we like it or not or or don't
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
like it or do like it or whatever
 
01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
they're out there this is just to her
 
01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
them in and to control what
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
access we as investors have to be able
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
to understand what's going on with the
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
Dow but these laws don't create
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
Dows these these laws allow us to
 
01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
control the Dow and to have transparency
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
with the Dow so there's a difference and
 
01:08:34.829 --> 01:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
and Dows are out there you're not going
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
to stop it they're happening because
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
they are legal in the United
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
States good point representative thank
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
you do you see any element of the Dows
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
security thank you for the question
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
representative I I think it's it depends
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
on what kind of um Dow that it is I'm
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
sure there are some Dows out there that
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
do sell Securities but there's others
 
01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
that may be like a a Condominium
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
Association um where they just vote on
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
um things that happen with their
 
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
Association so it depends on what the
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
Dow is set up to do it's just like any
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
company so so not only might they have
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
to file Dow um information they might
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
have to uh actually uh file for as a
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
security correct in some instances yes
 
01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
and I think that um representative said
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
on page 18 line 22 that this would not
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
prevent them from or this would not this
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
would still they would still have to
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
follow all other appical state laws
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you can't skirt it okay so I was
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
going to be done but I uh uh urged me to
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
have Kamar you know Baka come on up and
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
and give us a give us a story or two you
 
01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
know tell us tell
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
put some put some meat on one of these
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
bones for us so we have an idea what
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
about my name is Kumar buap pattinam um
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
of Manchester New Hampshire my
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
background is in mathematics and
 
01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
cryptography and I work in the asset
 
01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.350 align:start position:0%
cryptography and I work in the asset
tokenization

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
tokenization
 
01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
space of I would like to clarify while
 
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
we have been calling these organizations
 
01:10:20.669 --> 01:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
Dows a better rhetorical term from the
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
comments I've heard would be an
 
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
algorithmically governed Corporation
 
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
because that is what it is instead of
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
having let's say a a CEO or a board of
 
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
directors make corporate decisions we
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
have an algorithm
 
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
that controls the corporation controls
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
what it does and what this bill would in
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
effect do by creating a registry of
 
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.950 align:start position:0%
effect do by creating a registry of
these

01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
algorithms is provide sound legal
 
01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.630 align:start position:0%
algorithms is provide sound legal
structure

01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.390 align:start position:0%
structure
for

01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
this new form of corporate governance
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
that has made its way to the stand I
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
mean the primary reason why I'm in favor
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill in addition to all the
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
reasons spoken about is that fraud
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
actually will decline quite a bit if I'm
 
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
pitching a dow to my investors or
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
clients I can open up the Secretary of
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
State's website and say outright this is
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
the algorithm this is how this
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
investment or this firm is
 
01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.229 align:start position:0%
investment or this firm is
governed

01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
governed
 
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
and there is absolutely no way
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
that any investor can hide manipulate
 
01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.990 align:start position:0%
that any investor can hide manipulate
hide

01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
hide
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
and engage in Acts of fraud that they
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
actually would be able to under
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
traditional corporate governance as
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
we've seen with FTX and s bank and freed
 
01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
in addition this bill would also greatly
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
encourage shareholder participation
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
corporate voting at best is very
 
01:12:00.629 --> 01:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
difficult and at worst Byzantine which
 
01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
leads to most of us even in our
 
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
investments throwing our vote away to
 
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
proxies by
 
01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
allowing by allowing a cryptographically
 
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
secure corporate voting method we can
 
01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
directly interact with our Corporation
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
and we can express our opinions without
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
a chilling effect because algorithms are
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
not susceptible to power plays and
 
01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:23.990 align:start position:0%
not susceptible to power plays and
conflict

01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
are and
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
in and finally if anything this bill
 
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
would similar to New Hampshire's trust
 
01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
laws bring a lot of domestic and forign
 
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
wealth to the state which is why I'm
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
here testifying in favor of this Bill
 
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time and
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
I'm open to answer any
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
questions represent Senor Herbert has a
 
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.590 align:start position:0%
questions represent Senor Herbert has a
question

01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:02.679 align:start position:0%
algorithms um are your your
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh your expertise as a mathematician I'm
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
assuming that you've actually written
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
algorithms uh and and know all about
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
them yes now the idea is my concern one
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
of my concerns is that um nothing is
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
perfect and the first people to find out
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
where a weakness
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
is are usually going to do something
 
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
illegal now that's just
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
history uh and and and you so I'm I need
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
to know that these
 
01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
algorithms uh I mean I've heard you know
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
somebody losing an algorithm and the
 
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
money is gone and they were some guy
 
01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
went into a dump in uh in England I mean
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
it was just outrageous but I need to be
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know I am not secure yet with uh
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
this push and uh and do algorithms ever
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
make mistakes I mean is uh to aay your
 
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
concerns I would say that algorithms are
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
in no means perfect but they are a lot
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
better at managing than humans because
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
we are prone to error and more arguably
 
01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
more so than
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
computers and to your point of let's say
 
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
losing your key it is a lot more
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to let's say lose a key than
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
lose that much of cash stuffed under
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
your mattress in that sense algorithms
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
are much more secure and even when they
 
01:14:43.629 --> 01:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
fail because algorithms do fail in the
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
in a similar manner that humans do they
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
fail predictably which
 
01:14:52.629 --> 01:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
makes the legal recognition of dows or
 
01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
as I would say algorithmically governed
 
01:14:59.629 --> 01:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
to necessary to encourage corporate
 
01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
Innovation okay just one follow on
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
follow so
 
01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
um if you're helping uh the state of New
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire write these laws and
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
everybody's learning more and more about
 
01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
them um does this mean that we need to
 
01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
have somebody
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
with your kind of skill
 
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
set at you know we just talked to the
 
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
corporate division of the state do we
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
need to have somebody with your skill
 
01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.070 align:start position:0%
need to have somebody with your skill
set

01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
set
 
01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
uh as you know a full-time employee I
 
01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
mean I'd be a lot more uh comfortable if
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
there was that kind of
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
expertise in the uh in in our
 
01:15:51.629 --> 01:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
governance what this bill does is all it
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
does is to the representatives point the
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
algorithms are out there this bill just
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
puts them in a
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
registry similar to how a limited
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
liability Corporation operates I'd argue
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
that the skill set that is necessary is
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
the exact same as an
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
LLC the only difference is these
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
corporations are being run by an
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.350 align:start position:0%
 
people

01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
what time is it now okay represent
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you for coming I I do want
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
to make one point of clarification and
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh Kumar uh you haven't had any input in
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
this legislation is that correct yes so
 
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
there's no input but we're open to
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
suggestions from you so I want to make
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
that clear um so this is this is how I
 
01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
Envision the transparency aspect right
 
01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
so we all imagine xay glasses you know
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
that they sell them in the back of
 
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
magazines you put the xray glasses on
 
01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.350 align:start position:0%
magazines you put the xray glasses on
right

01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh so a dow is sort of like x-ray vision
 
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
on how a corporation a corporation under
 
01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
the structure operates you can see all
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
the decisions and the logic behind those
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
decisions like to a fine granular uh
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
level uh would you agree with that
 
01:17:16.719 --> 01:17:18.149 align:start position:0%
level uh would you agree with that
assessment

01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
yes what ad Dow effectively does is by
 
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
making the algorithms public investors
 
01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
clients everyone can see exactly what is
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
going on bringing far more transparency
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
structures great thank you very much
 
01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
okay I think we'll we'll stop this now
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
and uh we will take it up when we
 
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
schedule our next subcommittee and I
 
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
think we talking about
 
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
what it was November what was the
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
November 7th what day of the week was
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.870 align:start position:0%
November 7th what day of the week was
that

01:17:57.870 --> 01:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
okay so November 7th we'll we'll take
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
this up
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
again all right let's move on to the
 
01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.790 align:start position:0%
again all right let's move on to the
next

01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.070 align:start position:0%
next
bill

01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
pasas okay representative spear you're
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:40.430 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.920 --> 01:19:13.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
okay when last we
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
met in a place far far away and long ago
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
we had two bills hp2 42 and HP
 
01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
465 those two bills
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
465 prohibited the sale of carpets with
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
pasas and 242 prohibited the sale of
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.629 --> 01:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
pasas neither Bill required that the
 
01:19:47.629 --> 01:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
state test anything it was going to be a
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
some notion of a clearing house and
 
01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
vendors would have to put certifications
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
into their Clearing House swearing that
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
they don't have any PS in those uh those
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
um components products and if they did
 
01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
then they could sell them in the state
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and if they did not
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to sell them in
 
01:20:12.189 --> 01:20:12.199 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the things that got me
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
really bothered by this not by the bills
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
but how I got into this past thing was I
 
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
the discovery materials from lawsuits
 
01:20:33.149 --> 01:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
that happened to uh Dupont and
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
3M for 30 or 40
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
years Dupont and 3M
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
knew that they were poisoning their
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
employees as a matter of fact one of the
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
cases that settled in
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
1998 required Dupont to publish the
 
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
results of their findings
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
in the real world you would not be
 
01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that kind of an experiment
 
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
on any set of
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
people they published information that
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
said there was no impact when they fig
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
figured out when they were required by
 
01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
law to publish the results they found
 
01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:17.639 align:start position:0%
out that pasas was causing testiscle
 
01:21:21.070 --> 01:21:21.080 align:start position:0%

01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
and low birth
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
weight when they found out that the
 
01:21:33.629 --> 01:21:33.639 align:start position:0%
women who were working in those
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
facilities were being impacted they
 
01:21:37.709 --> 01:21:37.719 align:start position:0%
transferred them as soon as they got
 
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
pregnant they transferred them out of
 
01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:39.990 align:start position:0%
pregnant they transferred them out of
the

01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
facility a reputable
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
company in my mind a reputable company
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
would never have done that but be that
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
as it
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
may then came the FDA and the FDA
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
says the FDA
 
01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
says they don't test anything right in
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
this particular case I don't know if
 
01:22:05.709 --> 01:22:05.719 align:start position:0%
they test anything in any other uh
 
01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
industry but they don't test in the
 
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
chemical industry relating to past what
 
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
they do is they get letters and reports
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
from companies that say our components
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
are safe and the only thing you worry
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
about are bip are uh breakdown products
 
01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
safe FDA published two two reports last
 
01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
earlier this year actually this year but
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
earlier this year in which they said
 
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
that chemical companies were giving them
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
affidavits that said this stuff was safe
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
when in fact in the public research had
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
already proven they were not safe and so
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
the we couldn't count on the FDA anymore
 
01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
EPA steps in and they start saying
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
things about the water and they put
 
01:22:57.229 --> 01:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
limits on the water uh the
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill has now some money
 
01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
in it to try and clean up some of the
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
stuff 3M in their lawsuit they settle
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
for 12 billion now to me being a jaded
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
New Yorker anybody who's willing to
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
settle for 12 billion do without going
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
to court has something to hide but
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
me so all of that money is going to be
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
used to try and clean this up but P
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
cleaning up PS is very very difficult
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay so the only way we're going to stop
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
this is by getting it out of the stream
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
to begin with is to not letting it come
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
in now we have 3M and we have Dupont and
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
we have Honeywell and they are all part
 
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
of the pest manufacturing
 
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
industry but there are nine other
 
01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
companies in the world at Manu
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
manufactur Pest and and as a matter of
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
fact the largest one is in China and we
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
get a lot of our clothes that are
 
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured over there so they're
 
01:23:59.229 --> 01:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
coming in with PFS Coatings there's I
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
don't know how we would have even stop
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
that but maybe California is going to
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
try that being said for due
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
out ah I can't find it 90% of the past
 
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
that's in our
 
01:24:24.270 --> 01:24:24.280 align:start position:0%
waste uh solid waste uh facilities comes
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
from food packaging alone
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
90% there are studies that have been
 
01:24:32.270 --> 01:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
done by both
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh I want to say uh what is it uh oh
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
several universities and I I just I have
 
01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
papers on it but I'm sorry I'm my brain
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
isn't as fast as it once was there are a
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
number of studies that show that pest
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
leeches out of the food packaging and
 
01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
goes into the food almost instantly of
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
that packaging being put on the food
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
there have been blood tests that show
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
how the pest has increased in people's
 
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
blood from the minute they step in to
 
01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
the minute after they finish a meal that
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
comes from McDonald's or comes from even
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh microwave
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
popcorn so the past that's going into
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
the waste is leeching out and is going
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
into our
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
groundwater and as a result of that our
 
01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
groundwater's being polluted and
 
01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:24.639 align:start position:0%
remember remember I said 90% of the
 
01:25:27.149 --> 01:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
pollution that's in the pest pollution
 
01:25:29.629 --> 01:25:29.639 align:start position:0%
in the waste is coming from pest at of
 
01:25:29.639 --> 01:25:31.430 align:start position:0%
in the waste is coming from pest at of
food

01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
food
 
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.719 align:start position:0%
packaging so that's the setting that
 
01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
we're in and the only way we're going to
 
01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
stop this is by not allowing it into the
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
state and there's there's bills in 24
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
States and there's current active bills
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
that have actually been enacted in 12
 
01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
states to stop this and unfortunately we
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
happen to be in an area that's been hard
 
01:25:53.709 --> 01:25:53.719 align:start position:0%
hit worse than most
 
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
others we have the highest pediatric
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
cancer rate in the country we have the
 
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
second highest breast cancer rate in the
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
country we have the highest bladder
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
cancer rate in the country we are being
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
polluted all over the place and it's not
 
01:26:13.229 --> 01:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
just pest but that's a part of
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
it and I think as a legislative body one
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
of the things we have to do is try and
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
protect ourselves as best we can and
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
this is something something that's easy
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
to do so when we last met John
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
suggested uh representative hunt
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
suggested that we combine the two
 
01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:37.400 align:start position:0%
bills since then Karen eel eel has
 
01:26:40.030 --> 01:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
worked to combine the two
 
01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
bills and set up and more definition
 
01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
with the Clearing House and worked with
 
01:26:46.990 --> 01:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
num MOA and Dees num MOA is the
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
Northeast Waste Management official
 
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
Association and they are uh collections
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
of Dees officials in the Northeast that
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
work on these kinds of things and they
 
01:26:59.790 --> 01:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
put together model legislation which I
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
just got the other day it's a little
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
more broad than what we want it still is
 
01:27:06.030 --> 01:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
it's better than it was but it's still a
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
broad but Karen has been able to uh work
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
with that and work with the bill that
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
came out of Vermont and has set up
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
something and the way we're doing it the
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
way we're doing it is this
 
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
rather than tighten up the definition of
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
past because some people want it to be
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
defined this way some people want it to
 
01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
find that way all different ways we're
 
01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
just saying in these four products and
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
the four products are food packaging
 
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
carpeting children's toys and dental
 
01:27:43.470 --> 01:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
floss in these four products no
 
01:27:45.629 --> 01:27:45.639 align:start position:0%
pasas you can put it anywhere else you
 
01:27:48.189 --> 01:27:48.199 align:start position:0%
want but yet not putting it in there
 
01:27:49.629 --> 01:27:49.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to protect the
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
kids we're going to protect our food
 
01:27:51.679 --> 01:27:53.830 align:start position:0%
kids we're going to protect our food
source

01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
and keep it out of your mouth for
 
01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.709 align:start position:0%
and keep it out of your mouth for
goodness

01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
goodness
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
sake because the really the some of the
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
new uh the new uh Dental flosses are
 
01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
very very slippery because they have
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
pasas in
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
them and you don't need that in your
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
mouth and because it's rubbing against
 
01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:10.590 align:start position:0%
mouth and because it's rubbing against
your

01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
out so we don't want to really tighten
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
up the uh loose tighten up the
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
definition now what the EPA has done and
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
I have the law right here so if anybody
 
01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
wants to question it 155
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
Pages what the EPA has done is they said
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to create a registry now
 
01:28:34.590 --> 01:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
they're not g they won't
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
include breakdown products which I think
 
01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:39.400 align:start position:0%
is a mistake but they said they can't at
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
this time that doesn't mean they won't
 
01:28:45.109 --> 01:28:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
1447 PS chemical
 
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
definitions and they what they're doing
 
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
is they're tracking every everybody who
 
01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
makes any of this stuff or makes a
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
product that contains this stuff has to
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
put it in their registry once it's in
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
the registry they will decide in a few
 
01:29:02.189 --> 01:29:02.199 align:start position:0%
years from now which are the ones that
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
are coming in and that are hurting us
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
the most and then they will make the
 
01:29:07.629 --> 01:29:07.639 align:start position:0%
laws then laws will be enacted if
 
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
Congress wants to otherwise EPA doesn't
 
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
have that
 
01:29:13.229 --> 01:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
ability what we want to do is we're
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
going to say just these four products
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
that's the end of it you put them on the
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
registry if you make any of these
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
products you put it on the registry you
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
swear that you're not going to put any
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
past in them and you put and you present
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
specific data now we have several of
 
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
these Clearing Houses already in
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
existence in the Northeast there's about
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
four of them in fact one of them was set
 
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
up by our own Dees for mercury so it' be
 
01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
the same kind of thing just the same
 
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
exact kind of thing like the Mercury one
 
01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
and the reason why I'm not in a hurry to
 
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
pass these bills right now is that
 
01:29:49.109 --> 01:29:49.119 align:start position:0%
database hasn't been set up
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
yet so it'll be set up very shortly but
 
01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:55.400 align:start position:0%
they need these they need a bill to push
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
it to get the to get the things set up
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
so what I ask of you is this if we put
 
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
these two bills and I'm looking at you
 
01:30:06.199 --> 01:30:08.550 align:start position:0%
these two bills and I'm looking at you
representative

01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:11.109 --> 01:30:11.119 align:start position:0%
hunt if we put these two bills on
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
interim study for now so that we can
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
have representative eel's bill which
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
does the things we talked about can we
 
01:30:22.189 --> 01:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
commit to the fact that first of all
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
that bill will come
 
01:30:26.830 --> 01:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
here and you can do your little magic I
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:33.109 --> 01:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
can and if it when it does come here we
 
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
give it a fair
 
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
things you haven't shed enough blood
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
today um so no the I mean obviously the
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
speaker makes that choice and I I will I
 
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
will speak to the speaker and then we'll
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
bring it and ab a fair hearing and and I
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
would say it it'll absolutely get a fair
 
01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
hearing you know the obviously the big
 
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
touchy point is the the one one polymer
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
or two or more polymer and and and the
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
food packaging because the the
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
is very leery how they're because they
 
01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
they see themselves as the regulator of
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
that rather than uh Waste Systems so
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
those having I'm just telling you now
 
01:31:24.109 --> 01:31:24.119 align:start position:0%
what I know will be the issues okay but
 
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
and so but absolutely we'll have a fe
 
01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and absolutely will you know
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
work work to find a resolution you know
 
01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's mean I have to say when once I
 
01:31:35.709 --> 01:31:35.719 align:start position:0%
found out about the Mercury uh and and
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
this the Clearing House concept um I
 
01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
knew that that was was a winner and that
 
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
that was the right way to go and that
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
because it's we're not creating a new a
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
new system a new process that that that
 
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing now so in my
 
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
mind that is if you're ever gonna
 
01:31:53.669 --> 01:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
address the PFS problem that is the way
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.590 --> 01:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
it generally
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
not I think I'm signed on to so many
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
bills this year it's just it's you know
 
01:32:05.229 --> 01:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
too much too
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
much so thanks oh you okay so yes we
 
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
collab just really quickly um as the
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
owner of food service operation
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
basically um these Clearing Houses
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
already exist here in the state so when
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
I am ordering I generally select things
 
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
that are pasos free it just needed you
 
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
to know that it already is in existence
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
these companies that are basically
 
01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
National and international they already
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
have these things in place because other
 
01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
states are protecting against it and
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
they're trying to be preemptive I would
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
guess of the liability issues and they
 
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
care about the welfare of the people
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
they're feeding so um I have that um
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
concern with the products that I am
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
purchasing and I just need you to know
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
that this is already in
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
existence okay okay but it's not
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
mandatory it is not right right and and
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
I one thing I've have been amazed at and
 
01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
my wife ly said here we've been every
 
01:33:04.270 --> 01:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
time I have an opportunity to ask people
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
about do you have past or know anything
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
about past they all look at me like I
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
have three heads on I mean evidently p
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
is the best is not out there and I mean
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
even in a furniture store they have no
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
idea about people there A lot of
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
uneducated people well I don't know if
 
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
it's educated I would not say that I'm
 
01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
an un educated person the only reason I
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
know about p is because you know I read
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
the newspaper about what happened in
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
marac you know if it hadn't if it hadn't
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
happened at peas you know for the fire
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
retardant materials and and marac with
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
one Factory I don't think I would known
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
pasas so any rate so the motion that
 
01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
representative spear will take each one
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
up at the separately um we'll start out
 
01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
with with uh this the first one on the
 
01:33:53.639 --> 01:33:54.910 align:start position:0%
with with uh this the first one on the
list

01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
465 representative spear um moves to
 
01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:00.950 align:start position:0%
465 representative spear um moves to
interim

01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
interim
 
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
study 465 and and 242 well we'll do
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
we'll do them each separately
 
01:34:08.239 --> 01:34:11.750 align:start position:0%
we'll do them each separately
okay

01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:15.070 --> 01:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so just just a question about
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
that this is the second year yes it's
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
going be the second interim study where
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
does how does that work okay so interim
 
01:34:22.830 --> 01:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
study that's good glad you asked so inim
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
study means uh this bill will hit the
 
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
house floor the first week of January so
 
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
um don't want to miss that
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
week because every committee has the
 
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
same same issue that that first week and
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
then this I think the in the second week
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
all the bills are going to be all these
 
01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
bills are going to hit the floor
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
everything that was uh retained and um
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
and it once it's if the interim study is
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
passed by the full body uh that means we
 
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
will will get a chance to talk about
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
this again next
 
01:34:59.070 --> 01:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
September and that would be after we've
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
taken action on whatever bill so it uh
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
historically we always you know we say
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
in at that time and then at that time
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
the vote is recommended or not
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation but
 
01:35:14.669 --> 01:35:14.679 align:start position:0%
that would obviously be depending about
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
whatever happens to Evil's bill this
 
01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
coming year but yes we will get to talk
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
Fall this bill can come up in the next
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
session correct whether it's inter study
 
01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:37.159 align:start position:0%
or not or not recommended for uh
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
legislation correct well the key element
 
01:35:46.510 --> 01:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
is that if um if we if we kill a bill
 
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
you can't reintroduce it okay interim
 
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
study is not not a kill motion even
 
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
though people call it Killing Me Gently
 
01:35:56.830 --> 01:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
but it's not a kill motion it it's the
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
bill is still alive so absolutely the
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
bill in in the the subject matter can be
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
reinduced in the second year but not the
 
01:36:08.109 --> 01:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
second year but next session well the
 
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
next session it's it's a clean slate
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
exactly you know every every you get you
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
could you could bring in the same issue
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
every two years for the rest of your
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
life if you as long as you keep getting
 
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
elected right so I don't know why why
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
interim study how is it how is that
 
01:36:26.189 --> 01:36:26.199 align:start position:0%
rather than kill it no well interim
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
study is to show that we still care
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
about this issue we have a vehicle to
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
talk about it and and has it's just a
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
baseline so no I I have no problem with
 
01:36:37.870 --> 01:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
inter and then and then the issue comes
 
01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
down to is next year whether it's
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation or
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
not recommended and at that point in
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
time we'll talk about we'll talk about
 
01:36:48.109 --> 01:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
what happened slowly and it informs it
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
keeps keeps it keeps the issue alive so
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
I mean other issues it's like the
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
committee committee could always talk
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
about a certain subject matter and and
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
have that subject matter around so yes M
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
Spirit we talked about just a little bit
 
01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
about the definition of what PS is right
 
01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:08.679 align:start position:0%
and the way it is in the these the two
 
01:37:11.229 --> 01:37:11.239 align:start position:0%
bills that we have here that we've been
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
talking about is that it can be as small
 
01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
as one carbon
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
Florine pair if you will and there's
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
been objections to that in the case of
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
pmoa their definition is one fully
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
fluorinated carbon and one partially
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
fluorinated carbon pair one and a half
 
01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
yes killing me it's not really one and a
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.149 --> 01:37:45.159 align:start position:0%
is part of the problem is is
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
hfos hfos are a a a type of uh
 
01:37:57.589 --> 01:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
past that the EPA does not consider past
 
01:37:59.950 --> 01:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous because hfos that's the
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
chemical that's used in like uh
 
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
refrigerators and stuff because as soon
 
01:38:07.229 --> 01:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
as it hits the atmosphere it breaks down
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
pretty quick the problem with
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
hfos is that the breakdown
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
products are very toxic and they last
 
01:38:20.189 --> 01:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
for 30 years and they land in the water
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
and they they're even even less
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
filterable than pz chemicals
 
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
are but I I don't I'm not trying to ban
 
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
those I you know they have a a place and
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
there's people who work with that and
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's some other issue that's another
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
issue we just want to ban whatever
 
01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
chemical you're putting in food
 
01:38:44.189 --> 01:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
children's toys carpets and dental
 
01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
floors so it's not the definition it's
 
01:38:47.599 --> 01:38:48.750 align:start position:0%
floors so it's not the definition it's
the

01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
use yes repres representative m um I'm a
 
01:38:55.149 --> 01:38:55.159 align:start position:0%
little bit confused uh I thought that
 
01:38:57.310 --> 01:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
these two bills we will put on inter
 
01:39:00.589 --> 01:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
term study and we look at them uh a year
 
01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
from now but in the meantime this
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
combination bill will come up be in the
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
interim January and we can vote on that
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
is that correct yeah so yeah so we we we
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
actually retained this this first year
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
was is
 
01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
retaining okay and and so um we could
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
have I would say is if things were
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
moving along fast enough faster with new
 
01:39:27.229 --> 01:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Mo or the New England Mota
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
we might have been able to amend one of
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
these bills with that language but the
 
01:39:35.229 --> 01:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
fact is the fact the fact is that no
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
matter what the effective data is going
 
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
to be pushed out to 2025 anyways so it's
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
just that that that the uh and I'm
 
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
honoring represent spe and represent EV
 
01:39:48.189 --> 01:39:48.199 align:start position:0%
the sponsor that you know they they
 
01:39:50.589 --> 01:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
requested that we would just keep these
 
01:39:53.149 --> 01:39:53.159 align:start position:0%
alive you know we study them uh but that
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
at the end day you know we'll we'll
 
01:39:58.030 --> 01:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
address this issue with the next Bill
 
01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:00.920 align:start position:0%

uh was supposed to go to the service
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
what do they call it
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
here HCS HCS it went to HCS who I guess
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
was supposed I thought was supposed to
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
distribute it to everybody but we don't
 
01:42:42.669 --> 01:42:42.679 align:start position:0%
have it so so okay all right um other
 
01:42:44.589 --> 01:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
than that it's done it's pretty simple
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
you have it right now on your computer
 
01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
right I do okay uh can I yeah I want her
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%

01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple if you're it's pretty
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
simple you just read it that's what I
 
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
was thinking it's it doesn't seem like
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's worth the
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
paper uh I mean to print it out 18 times
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
um historically we've always uh said
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
that that we have to have a that that PR
 
01:43:28.589 --> 01:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
C we have everybody has it in their
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
hands so that you you
 
01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
know it's it's a security issue okay I'm
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
good she was there pretty simple so
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
do it's what the guy asked for so but I
 
01:43:44.589 --> 01:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
guess I could you know every rule is
 
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
made to be broken so does everyone have
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
everyone have have it on their
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
toy oh it was just subcommittee we just
 
01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:02.189 --> 01:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
sub you want to can you just you want me
 
01:44:04.350 --> 01:44:04.360 align:start position:0%
to just read it
 
01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:13.229 --> 01:44:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.599 --> 01:44:22.510 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:44:22.510 --> 01:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.560 --> 01:50:30.030 align:start position:0%
 
bunch

01:50:30.030 --> 01:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
right come back all right let's get
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
lunch all right
 
01:50:38.639 --> 01:50:40.470 align:start position:0%
lunch all right
so

01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
um representative taxton uh Second and
 
01:50:46.030 --> 01:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
uh by
 
01:50:50.069 --> 01:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
representative Hammond um moves uh a to
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
pass on the amendment and he's
 
01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak to his Amendment
 
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
motion well it's not really complicated
 
01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
it's not like the PF
 
01:51:04.510 --> 01:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
thing uh when we when we met last time
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh the the request was made the
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
preference was that the uh whole section
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
be removed or so that's what we did and
 
01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
it repeals I'll just read it for the
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
sake of the record uh
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
the motion or the amendment is to repeal
 
01:51:27.069 --> 01:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
the following RSA 155 colon 40 relative
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
to the requirements to provide toilet
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
facilities in restaurants RSA 155 col 41
 
01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
relative to the penalty for failure to
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
provide such toilet
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
facilities and the analysis is this bill
 
01:51:40.990 --> 01:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
removes the requirement that restaurants
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
and other businesses that serve food to
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
the public provide toilet facilities for
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
patrons that's
 
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:50.709 align:start position:0%
patrons that's
it

01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
and so we have a new member of our
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
committee welcome rep
 
01:51:58.109 --> 01:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
MCU um and uh I think maybe we need a
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
little bit of catch up on the issue
 
01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
around this uh bill so it's my
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
understanding and someone correct me if
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong that there are building codes
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
that supersede this and corre and make
 
01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
this statute obsolete right that was the
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
real point the the building it's not
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
like restaurants are no longer going to
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
have bathrooms right uh the point of
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
this was this is redundant and there
 
01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
were so many exceptions in it as it was
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
with but you have to have a you don't
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
have to have a bathroom if you're if
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
you're a food truck if you're a hot dog
 
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
stand and various other things so the
 
01:52:36.109 --> 01:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
suggestion was made since it's already
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
covered in building code that this the
 
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
whole section be
 
01:52:42.669 --> 01:52:42.679 align:start position:0%
eliminated makes sense yeah I watched a
 
01:52:45.069 --> 01:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
lot of YouTube hearings uh but I thought
 
01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
this one was simple enough I could Skip
 
01:52:49.109 --> 01:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
and evidently not so thanks for the
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
catchup y
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
yes okay everybody else said right
 
01:52:57.629 --> 01:52:57.639 align:start position:0%
everybody remembers remembers that day
 
01:53:00.629 --> 01:53:00.639 align:start position:0%
right so this is still the business this
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
is business
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
still okay uh so oh all those in favor
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass on the amendment please
 
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:12.840 align:start position:0%

01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
ta representative taxon second by
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon moves uh ought to
 
01:53:30.069 --> 01:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
pass as amended any discussion on the
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
motion seeing none the clerk does not
 
01:53:34.350 --> 01:53:34.360 align:start position:0%

oppos so moved
 
01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
done um I just want to um let everybody
 
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
know the first bill we're going to be
 
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
taking up the liquor
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill and um there there was a you guys
 
01:53:58.750 --> 01:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
got it mailed out to you late last night
 
01:54:01.229 --> 01:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
and I did not have a chance to read it
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh and I am making a couple of changes
 
01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
on it um and and
 
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
um and if you have it near you uh what
 
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
where is that on the section one uh
 
01:54:17.470 --> 01:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
cannot exceed we the current law is 10
 
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
days so we want to keep the current law
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
10 days but that's only if all the
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
employees have had
 
01:54:30.270 --> 01:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
training and then the UN Roman numeral
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
well un R little little
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
eye um the second offense uh uh up has
 
01:54:40.589 --> 01:54:40.599 align:start position:0%
30-day would still be the up to that
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
still leaves the commission to decide
 
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
whether that uh was really um the
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
situational situation which is the way
 
01:54:50.589 --> 01:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
we've over always handled it with the
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission so that is what I
 
01:54:55.470 --> 01:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
would like to take up as an
 
01:54:58.709 --> 01:54:58.719 align:start position:0%

afternoon

02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:44.080 --> 02:51:43.550 align:start position:0%
 
for

02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:43.560 --> 02:59:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
for

02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:12.840 --> 03:28:25.269 align:start position:0%
 
I

03:28:25.269 --> 03:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:30.030 --> 03:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
what's that 198
 
03:28:34.389 --> 03:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
what's oh yeah okay yeah the social yeah
 
03:28:40.189 --> 03:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:40.199 --> 03:29:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:29:09.830 --> 03:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:15.630 --> 03:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:15.640 --> 03:29:18.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:29:18.070 --> 03:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:18.080 --> 03:29:25.750 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:29:25.750 --> 03:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:29.550 --> 03:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
uh okay obviously this is a work in
 
03:29:32.309 --> 03:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
progress um and we have been moving
 
03:29:34.110 --> 03:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
along in terms of coming up with the
 
03:29:34.120 --> 03:29:35.070 align:start position:0%
along in terms of coming up with the
right

03:29:35.070 --> 03:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:29:38.309 --> 03:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
language um so at this point this is
 
03:29:42.429 --> 03:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
where I'm at and I if we can discuss and
 
03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
if anybody want to take take differ
 
03:29:46.309 --> 03:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
opinions to
 
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:54.710 --> 03:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee judges Ru
 
03:29:59.309 --> 03:29:59.319 align:start position:0%
in okay all right um to start out with
 
03:30:02.550 --> 03:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
is um I know the the original bill was
 
03:30:04.469 --> 03:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
introduced as
 
03:30:09.309 --> 03:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth law um the problem when you
 
03:30:13.990 --> 03:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
put a name on a on on a bill is that
 
03:30:14.000 --> 03:30:15.469 align:start position:0%
put a name on a on on a bill is that
name

03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
name
 
03:30:18.110 --> 03:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
disappears you know it's not in the
 
03:30:21.710 --> 03:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
statute and um I have had times where
 
03:30:23.469 --> 03:30:23.479 align:start position:0%
people said well I thought you guys
 
03:30:26.150 --> 03:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
passed this law and I go you know you
 
03:30:30.269 --> 03:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
know so I as much as I I want everyone
 
03:30:32.469 --> 03:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
to know that we are taking up this
 
03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislation now uh in her honor and
 
03:30:37.630 --> 03:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
that's important that we are but at the
 
03:30:41.389 --> 03:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
same time um putting her name in the
 
03:30:44.229 --> 03:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
rsas uh is not it's not and I have no
 
03:30:45.510 --> 03:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
control over it's just not going to
 
03:30:48.990 --> 03:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
happen it's not it would be lost um and
 
03:30:50.630 --> 03:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
and I hate to you know have a in and
 
03:30:52.189 --> 03:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
someone say why why didn't you tell us
 
03:30:54.349 --> 03:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
that that was going to happen so I'm I'm
 
03:30:58.870 --> 03:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
just going to be upfront that um I think
 
03:31:01.630 --> 03:31:01.640 align:start position:0%
if um if they look up the B the bill
 
03:31:04.110 --> 03:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
then I think they'll probably reference
 
03:31:06.710 --> 03:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh Elizabeth cro if you I mean if you
 
03:31:09.189 --> 03:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
Google it or you know whatever if you
 
03:31:12.510 --> 03:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
you know that will pop up no no no it's
 
03:31:15.269 --> 03:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
gone it just once it's when it's in the
 
03:31:19.030 --> 03:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
RSA right not so the only time that name
 
03:31:22.469 --> 03:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
is there is is chapter law okay and the
 
03:31:24.070 --> 03:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
chapter is those yellow books I don't
 
03:31:26.150 --> 03:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
knowbody you ever SE they every year
 
03:31:27.510 --> 03:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
they try to get us to take the yellow
 
03:31:29.790 --> 03:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
books and right I've seen them and they
 
03:31:31.750 --> 03:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
have extra ones and nobody Wars them and
 
03:31:34.110 --> 03:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
that's the only place it'll ever be yeah
 
03:31:35.950 --> 03:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
so and I I just I just want to be
 
03:31:37.309 --> 03:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
straight because I think this is
 
03:31:40.469 --> 03:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
important legislation and and um and I
 
03:31:43.070 --> 03:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
think it's important that that you know
 
03:31:45.030 --> 03:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
we get it done and we don't you know
 
03:31:47.510 --> 03:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
without any pretense of what else it
 
03:31:50.189 --> 03:31:50.199 align:start position:0%
could be or not be
 
03:31:52.950 --> 03:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
um having said that uh I have to
 
03:31:55.429 --> 03:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
emphasize to everyone that this
 
03:31:59.269 --> 03:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
committee has had this legislation about
 
03:32:01.670 --> 03:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
changing um the 10
 
03:32:04.389 --> 03:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
days multiple times it's not this is not
 
03:32:06.349 --> 03:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
the first time we're revisiting it it
 
03:32:08.229 --> 03:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
just happens to be coincidentally that
 
03:32:10.269 --> 03:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
we're now doing it when the department
 
03:32:14.030 --> 03:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
is working on their rules anyways so it
 
03:32:15.870 --> 03:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
it worked out this is a good time for us
 
03:32:17.349 --> 03:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
to revisit
 
03:32:17.359 --> 03:32:19.429 align:start position:0%
to revisit
this

03:32:19.429 --> 03:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
um I think and I and I proposed it
 
03:32:25.750 --> 03:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
before that the most important thing
 
03:32:28.150 --> 03:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
that this committee is going to get
 
03:32:33.429 --> 03:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
across is how important training is that
 
03:32:35.469 --> 03:32:35.479 align:start position:0%
we need these employees to be trained
 
03:32:37.349 --> 03:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
and we need employers to not think
 
03:32:39.870 --> 03:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
that's a place where they can save money
 
03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
and cut costs
 
03:32:44.030 --> 03:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
so if nothing else with this bill is
 
03:32:47.110 --> 03:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here is impress
 
03:32:52.389 --> 03:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
upon um lenes the importance of of that
 
03:32:55.750 --> 03:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
so having said that um uh I I think
 
03:32:59.189 --> 03:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
we'll we're will leave the 10 days but
 
03:33:01.550 --> 03:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
they have have to get the training which
 
03:33:03.950 --> 03:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
is uh representative kill's bill that
 
03:33:06.189 --> 03:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
he's put in multiple times over the
 
03:33:08.469 --> 03:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
years and we've never passed but that we
 
03:33:11.670 --> 03:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
are now going to pass it and um that
 
03:33:15.269 --> 03:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
that that 30 days uh but then if in
 
03:33:19.030 --> 03:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
given the severity of the case um that
 
03:33:21.070 --> 03:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's not going to stop at 10: it it can
 
03:33:23.630 --> 03:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
go all the way up to 30 uh and that and
 
03:33:25.910 --> 03:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
that is done through the hearing process
 
03:33:27.830 --> 03:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
by the by The Liquor
 
03:33:30.429 --> 03:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
Commission um and then going on to the
 
03:33:34.030 --> 03:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
second offense um and that seven off is
 
03:33:35.670 --> 03:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
is within a seven-year
 
03:33:39.590 --> 03:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
window um and at that point um you know
 
03:33:41.389 --> 03:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
that that uh
 
03:33:43.830 --> 03:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
the training the training issues
 
03:33:47.030 --> 03:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
didn't the window of training is gone uh
 
03:33:48.830 --> 03:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
so now we we were going to go at least a
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
minimum of 15 days up to 30
 
03:33:56.229 --> 03:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
days um and as much as uh you know the
 
03:33:58.189 --> 03:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
hospitality business or you know
 
03:34:01.070 --> 03:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
restaurants would say 30 days is a is
 
03:34:03.070 --> 03:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
this you might as well be
 
03:34:05.590 --> 03:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
revocation um they're going to have to
 
03:34:08.670 --> 03:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
make that case to the commission that
 
03:34:10.990 --> 03:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
that whatever happened was not you know
 
03:34:14.070 --> 03:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's not worth worthy of the 30 days
 
03:34:16.269 --> 03:34:16.279 align:start position:0%
so um and then of course the third
 
03:34:18.349 --> 03:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
events is
 
03:34:21.429 --> 03:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
revocation but hopefully that will never
 
03:34:21.439 --> 03:34:22.389 align:start position:0%
revocation but hopefully that will never
ever

03:34:22.389 --> 03:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
ever
 
03:34:25.710 --> 03:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
happen so that's that's where I'm at and
 
03:34:27.469 --> 03:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly willing to to listen to
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
anybody have any feelings or
 
03:34:33.870 --> 03:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
differences on that but it seems to
 
03:34:36.550 --> 03:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
balance both sides but gets what I think
 
03:34:38.229 --> 03:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
is the most important thing is to
 
03:34:41.590 --> 03:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
emphasize how important is training the
 
03:34:41.600 --> 03:34:46.150 align:start position:0%
emphasize how important is training the
training

03:34:46.150 --> 03:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:46.160 --> 03:34:48.309 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:34:48.309 --> 03:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:34:48.319 --> 03:34:50.189 align:start position:0%
is
MH

03:34:50.189 --> 03:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
MH
 
03:34:53.229 --> 03:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
okay um so if everybody's okay then
 
03:34:54.950 --> 03:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's what the amendment that will look
 
03:34:58.030 --> 03:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
like when we take it up on November
 
03:35:01.229 --> 03:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
7th so I will also I will because we
 
03:35:03.349 --> 03:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
don't have the official Amendment um I
 
03:35:04.870 --> 03:35:04.880 align:start position:0%

03:38:31.990 --> 03:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
people just stay anyway because they
 
03:38:35.590 --> 03:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
want to hear how it went but I
 
03:38:35.600 --> 03:38:37.389 align:start position:0%
want to hear how it went but I
mean

03:38:37.389 --> 03:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:38:41.189 --> 03:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
if I think you could speak
 
03:38:42.389 --> 03:38:42.399 align:start position:0%
if you want you're not on the sub
 
03:38:49.510 --> 03:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:09.239 --> 03:43:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:38.880 --> 03:47:38.510 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:38.520 --> 03:51:25.550 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:51:25.550 --> 03:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:25.560 --> 03:51:27.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:51:27.630 --> 03:51:27.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:51:31.070 --> 03:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh last but not least Health uh health
 
03:51:33.670 --> 03:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
insurance bills okay first up Senate
 
03:51:35.389 --> 03:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 198 directing the insurance
 
03:51:37.309 --> 03:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
department to conduct a cost study of
 
03:51:39.149 --> 03:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
providing coverage or certain reprodu
 
03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
productive health
 
03:51:49.469 --> 03:51:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:49.479 --> 03:51:58.590 align:start position:0%
 
Alex

03:51:58.590 --> 03:51:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:12.710 --> 03:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:16.510 --> 03:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
good D your microphone and then I I told
 
03:52:18.870 --> 03:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
because my wife was here earlier that
 
03:52:21.149 --> 03:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
you people have to really pull this
 
03:52:24.229 --> 03:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
thing close to your mouth so if you
 
03:52:25.950 --> 03:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking to it and if you can't
 
03:52:25.960 --> 03:52:26.750 align:start position:0%
you're talking to it and if you can't
hear

03:52:26.750 --> 03:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
hear
 
03:52:29.309 --> 03:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
yourself that means nobody else can hear
 
03:52:32.990 --> 03:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
you so you you actually you know they
 
03:52:36.309 --> 03:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
they have it real well Ed so you can we
 
03:52:39.110 --> 03:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
don't have feedback but you do need to
 
03:52:42.429 --> 03:52:42.439 align:start position:0%
hold it very close to your to
 
03:52:42.439 --> 03:52:45.030 align:start position:0%
hold it very close to your to
mouth

03:52:45.030 --> 03:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
mouth
 
03:52:45.040 --> 03:52:47.710 align:start position:0%
mouth
okay

03:52:47.710 --> 03:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:52:50.590 --> 03:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
perfect so um introduce
 
03:52:54.349 --> 03:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
yourself I'm Alex Fel uh Health reform
 
03:52:56.389 --> 03:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
instructor for the insurance
 
03:52:58.389 --> 03:52:58.399 align:start position:0%
department I'm Michelle heat and I'm the
 
03:53:00.149 --> 03:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
health law policy legal
 
03:53:04.990 --> 03:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
council welcome and uh the two of us um
 
03:53:07.510 --> 03:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
were interacted with the external
 
03:53:11.149 --> 03:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
Actuarial firm that did the cost study
 
03:53:13.070 --> 03:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
um on this
 
03:53:16.189 --> 03:53:16.199 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
03:53:19.030 --> 03:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
and it's posted on our
 
03:53:21.670 --> 03:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
website um and would
 
03:53:24.990 --> 03:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
you like to hear a short description of
 
03:53:28.990 --> 03:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
the findings uh we we like the executive
 
03:53:31.229 --> 03:53:31.239 align:start position:0%
summary well I'll give you even shorter
 
03:53:38.110 --> 03:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
than that um the um study um divides the
 
03:53:43.469 --> 03:53:43.479 align:start position:0%
costs of up uh into two categories
 
03:53:48.510 --> 03:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
um um one sort of General category for
 
03:53:50.309 --> 03:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
assisted reproductive
 
03:53:55.229 --> 03:53:55.239 align:start position:0%
treatment and uh separate category for
 
03:54:00.110 --> 03:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
preservation um and uh in order to make
 
03:54:04.469 --> 03:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh uh this calculation about cost First
 
03:54:06.309 --> 03:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
there was a calculation about the number
 
03:54:08.309 --> 03:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
of people who would be eligible for the
 
03:54:08.319 --> 03:54:10.309 align:start position:0%
of people who would be eligible for the
services

03:54:10.309 --> 03:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:54:12.830 --> 03:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
um and then an estimation of the number
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
of people who would use the services and
 
03:54:19.630 --> 03:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
then that was multiplied by uh an
 
03:54:24.149 --> 03:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
estimation of the cost per Service uh
 
03:54:29.269 --> 03:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
for a variety of services that
 
03:54:31.070 --> 03:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
um are
 
03:54:35.950 --> 03:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
involved um and the uh first part of the
 
03:54:41.269 --> 03:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
study um found used a low medium and
 
03:54:41.279 --> 03:54:42.710 align:start position:0%
study um found used a low medium and
high

03:54:42.710 --> 03:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
high
 
03:54:47.910 --> 03:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
estimate um because it's very hard
 
03:54:51.309 --> 03:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
to uh pick numbers about the number of
 
03:54:54.429 --> 03:54:54.439 align:start position:0%
people who will be using the service um
 
03:54:59.229 --> 03:54:59.239 align:start position:0%
so it's more common to use this range um
 
03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
and the cost was expressed as a per
 
03:55:05.630 --> 03:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
member per month amount so you can think
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
of that as monthly
 
03:55:13.590 --> 03:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
premium um um and the low estimate U for
 
03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
the first part of the coverage was
 
03:55:21.349 --> 03:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
2525 and the high estimate was $1100
 
03:55:26.950 --> 03:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:32.510 --> 03:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
$50.2 um so those are large numbers um
 
03:55:35.590 --> 03:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at mandate coverage
 
03:55:39.309 --> 03:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
um estimates generally um
 
03:55:42.309 --> 03:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
um and then for the preservation part of
 
03:55:44.269 --> 03:55:44.279 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for
 
03:55:47.429 --> 03:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
that oh there we
 
03:55:51.710 --> 03:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
go um um two questions before we go on
 
03:55:54.189 --> 03:55:54.199 align:start position:0%
um again this is only affecting the
 
03:55:56.389 --> 03:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
small group right we're only the large
 
03:55:59.030 --> 03:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
group and and the large
 
03:56:01.510 --> 03:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
group only the large group only the
 
03:56:03.229 --> 03:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
large group so excluding individual
 
03:56:04.990 --> 03:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
market and small group Market in order
 
03:56:10.670 --> 03:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
to uh avoid that um issue the oh right
 
03:56:13.790 --> 03:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
the unfunded mandate under the UN
 
03:56:16.990 --> 03:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act yeah so we could we
 
03:56:19.349 --> 03:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
can force this onto large employer or
 
03:56:21.149 --> 03:56:21.159 align:start position:0%
large employers being the
 
03:56:27.229 --> 03:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
of over 51 to 100 is that 51 and above
 
03:56:30.229 --> 03:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
51 up yeah who were still buying the
 
03:56:33.630 --> 03:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
fully insured product rather than the
 
03:56:37.269 --> 03:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
being an aressa right so how many how
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
many lives were they they thinking that
 
03:56:41.910 --> 03:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
that that was going to pick
 
03:56:48.510 --> 03:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
up well um the total um oh there it is I
 
03:56:53.630 --> 03:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
was just going to plug head 237,000
 
03:56:58.710 --> 03:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay 237 237,000 is the potential pool
 
03:57:00.670 --> 03:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
but it's very difficult to estimate how
 
03:57:02.510 --> 03:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
many people would actually utilize these
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
serves so that's why we have the low
 
03:57:06.910 --> 03:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
medium and high So based on the low
 
03:57:09.750 --> 03:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
medium high estimates I think the low
 
03:57:12.950 --> 03:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
uptake was around 6,000 and high uptake
 
03:57:16.189 --> 03:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:20.670 --> 03:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
23,700 right so if we think that the
 
03:57:24.670 --> 03:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
average premium of the large employer is
 
03:57:25.670 --> 03:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:57:28.550 --> 03:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
be 600 500
 
03:57:34.990 --> 03:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:38.389 --> 03:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
10% yes this would be a sub holy moly
 
03:57:40.710 --> 03:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:42.990 --> 03:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
so part of the problem with this mandate
 
03:57:44.670 --> 03:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
study is that the language in the
 
03:57:47.710 --> 03:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
proposed bill was very broad so that
 
03:57:51.229 --> 03:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
opened up um a large variety of
 
03:57:53.269 --> 03:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
potential services that would be
 
03:57:56.110 --> 03:57:56.120 align:start position:0%
included and there's also language in
 
03:57:57.910 --> 03:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
the bill that this would be for a c
 
03:57:59.590 --> 03:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
certain classes of people however that
 
03:58:01.550 --> 03:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
would be discriminatory to just single
 
03:58:03.950 --> 03:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
out certain classes to allow to give
 
03:58:06.870 --> 03:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
them the covered benefit so we took we
 
03:58:08.750 --> 03:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
kind of disregarded that because would
 
03:58:10.830 --> 03:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
be discriminatory and we applied it to
 
03:58:12.309 --> 03:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
anyone that would be eligible for these
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
services so those two factors really
 
03:58:18.590 --> 03:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
increase the cost um if there's um going
 
03:58:20.269 --> 03:58:20.279 align:start position:0%
to be efforts to try to bring down the
 
03:58:22.349 --> 03:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
cost some of the suggestions would be to
 
03:58:25.110 --> 03:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
limit the types of services or put in
 
03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
some kind of parameters about what
 
03:58:29.229 --> 03:58:29.239 align:start position:0%
specific Services would be covered and
 
03:58:31.550 --> 03:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
in one what instances and that could
 
03:58:35.070 --> 03:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
potentially bring down the cost but um
 
03:58:38.550 --> 03:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay this this study considered that why
 
03:58:41.429 --> 03:58:41.439 align:start position:0%
wide variety of services so that's why
 
03:58:45.309 --> 03:58:45.319 align:start position:0%
the um amount is full spectrum
 
03:58:48.550 --> 03:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
yes yeah it was a little bit unusual
 
03:58:52.189 --> 03:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
usually we get the um proposed mandate
 
03:58:54.670 --> 03:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
already expressed in legislative
 
03:58:57.790 --> 03:58:57.800 align:start position:0%
language and then it gets referred to us
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
and this was this bill was actually
 
03:59:01.269 --> 03:59:01.279 align:start position:0%
itself about
 
03:59:05.349 --> 03:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
referring um mandate and we struggled
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
very much with questions of
 
03:59:07.439 --> 03:59:10.870 align:start position:0%
very much with questions of
interpretation

03:59:10.870 --> 03:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:14.429 --> 03:59:14.439 align:start position:0%
great okay why don't you keep going did
 
03:59:17.550 --> 03:59:17.560 align:start position:0%
unless did we get everything yeah the
 
03:59:19.990 --> 03:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
second part uh you know of the coverage
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
that was um
 
03:59:24.790 --> 03:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
evaluated I've lost the pages but it was
 
03:59:31.110 --> 03:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
also uh significant numbers um you're on
 
03:59:35.670 --> 03:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
it uh the low end was $9 PM pm and the
 
03:59:39.429 --> 03:59:39.439 align:start position:0%
highend was $35 PM pm um and the middle
 
03:59:39.439 --> 03:59:40.269 align:start position:0%
highend was $35 PM pm um and the middle
was

03:59:40.269 --> 03:59:40.279 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:59:43.750 --> 03:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
18 um for the preservation part of the
 
03:59:46.070 --> 03:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
services yeah you're you're got to speak
 
03:59:47.670 --> 03:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
a little
 
03:59:51.630 --> 03:59:51.640 align:start position:0%
louder okay I'll start over
 
03:59:56.429 --> 03:59:56.439 align:start position:0%
yeah the uh the low uh for as a Express
 
03:59:58.830 --> 03:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
and per member per month for the
 
04:00:01.510 --> 04:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
preservation Services was $9 the high
 
04:00:01.520 --> 04:00:02.309 align:start position:0%
preservation Services was $9 the high
was

04:00:02.309 --> 04:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:00:04.990 --> 04:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
$35.50 in the middle was
 
04:00:07.910 --> 04:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
$18 per member per month yeah so well
 
04:00:11.429 --> 04:00:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:15.510 --> 04:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
some preservation of egg and spr egg
 
04:00:17.070 --> 04:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
04:00:21.189 --> 04:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:21.199 --> 04:00:23.349 align:start position:0%
 
Chiller

04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
Chiller
 
04:00:27.550 --> 04:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
okay all right sen represent Terry so as
 
04:00:29.510 --> 04:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
I understand it in your initial
 
04:00:32.229 --> 04:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
presentation here or report to us you're
 
04:00:35.670 --> 04:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
saying that you're finding the language
 
04:00:38.950 --> 04:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill as being overly Broad
 
04:00:42.710 --> 04:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
and also a second problem is that it's
 
04:00:45.950 --> 04:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
it on its face is
 
04:00:48.790 --> 04:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
discriminatory uh well no The Way It Was
 
04:00:51.429 --> 04:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
Written had it seemed to leave no stone
 
04:00:54.429 --> 04:00:54.439 align:start position:0%
unturn in terms of all the circumstances
 
04:00:56.830 --> 04:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
so there wasn't any kind of parameters
 
04:00:59.229 --> 04:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
that would have limited to how who we
 
04:01:01.630 --> 04:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
could get the benefit so so therefore
 
04:01:03.910 --> 04:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
would would you might not conclude that
 
04:01:07.950 --> 04:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
the the the Bill's language needs work
 
04:01:12.070 --> 04:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
and and would be open to amendment to to
 
04:01:15.269 --> 04:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
yeah to to uh address the concerns that
 
04:01:18.910 --> 04:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
you have articulated yes um we've
 
04:01:20.710 --> 04:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
because you didn't say that but I'm I'm
 
04:01:22.469 --> 04:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
kind of inferring that from oh
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely your very there's uh the
 
04:01:29.229 --> 04:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
potential here for um designing
 
04:01:33.110 --> 04:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that um Works in response to
 
04:01:37.510 --> 04:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
the report to um limit the coverages uh
 
04:01:40.990 --> 04:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
to more closely align with I think what
 
04:01:41.000 --> 04:01:43.110 align:start position:0%
to more closely align with I think what
was

04:01:43.110 --> 04:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:01:47.030 --> 04:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
intended so yes if I may follow so so
 
04:01:49.149 --> 04:01:49.159 align:start position:0%
you what I'm hearing is that the bill
 
04:01:51.070 --> 04:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
that you're that you studied the
 
04:01:52.349 --> 04:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
language that you studied you would
 
04:01:54.429 --> 04:01:54.439 align:start position:0%
consider to
 
04:01:56.550 --> 04:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
be less than
 
04:01:59.389 --> 04:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
desirable and and and defective I don't
 
04:02:02.510 --> 04:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
mean to be pajora of here but it's it's
 
04:02:04.469 --> 04:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
deficient and defective and needs to be
 
04:02:07.149 --> 04:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
rectified in order to be able to be
 
04:02:07.159 --> 04:02:10.670 align:start position:0%
rectified in order to be able to be
viable

04:02:10.670 --> 04:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:13.070 --> 04:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
so what was actually in the bill that
 
04:02:15.510 --> 04:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
was presented to us was really a bill to
 
04:02:18.870 --> 04:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
create a cost study report and it gave
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
um some very general parameters it's not
 
04:02:24.910 --> 04:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily written in the context of if
 
04:02:28.510 --> 04:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
you were to um Implement a new mandate
 
04:02:30.189 --> 04:02:30.199 align:start position:0%
it was not written in that context it
 
04:02:32.309 --> 04:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
was really just to do this cost study
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
but when we did the cost study there was
 
04:02:36.870 --> 04:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
no specifics really put into it so
 
04:02:38.269 --> 04:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
that's why we ended up having to do do
 
04:02:41.269 --> 04:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
this very general very broad considering
 
04:02:44.309 --> 04:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
a whole spectrum of services so it we
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
would recommend if you want to bring
 
04:02:48.630 --> 04:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
down the cost in future legislation
 
04:02:50.110 --> 04:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
because this was just to do the study
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
and the study's done so I'm not sure
 
04:02:53.469 --> 04:02:53.479 align:start position:0%
that you would necessarily want to move
 
04:02:56.429 --> 04:02:56.439 align:start position:0%
forward with this but if you want to um
 
04:02:58.429 --> 04:02:58.439 align:start position:0%
introduce some new legislation on this
 
04:03:00.950 --> 04:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
issue um it would be advisable to
 
04:03:03.830 --> 04:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
include some definitions or some
 
04:03:06.750 --> 04:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
parameters about what specifically um
 
04:03:12.830 --> 04:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:14.910 --> 04:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
pelli do you know if uh did you look at
 
04:03:19.710 --> 04:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
other states to see what their
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
experiences were how many other states
 
04:03:24.590 --> 04:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
so we did not do the analysis Freeman
 
04:03:26.710 --> 04:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
did the analysis and they did review
 
04:03:30.670 --> 04:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
other states no state has um legislation
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
that's this broad that would remove um
 
04:03:35.469 --> 04:03:35.479 align:start position:0%
the requirement of medical necessity we
 
04:03:37.229 --> 04:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
do in New Hampshire already have a
 
04:03:39.070 --> 04:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
mandate on par U ility Services in the
 
04:03:41.349 --> 04:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
large group Market but that is limited
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
to what's medically necessary and I
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
believe this um the intention behind
 
04:03:47.149 --> 04:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
this type of legislation was to expand
 
04:03:47.159 --> 04:03:55.229 align:start position:0%
this type of legislation was to expand
that

04:03:55.229 --> 04:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:58.670 --> 04:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
coverage thank you very
 
04:04:02.269 --> 04:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
much all right
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh obviously I I guess first I want to
 
04:04:07.830 --> 04:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody understands that
 
04:04:09.630 --> 04:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
little conversation that Alex and I had
 
04:04:12.070 --> 04:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
just had there and that is when the
 
04:04:15.670 --> 04:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act was passed uh back
 
04:04:17.630 --> 04:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
when they called it Obamacare I guess
 
04:04:22.149 --> 04:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
and uh when it was passed um they they
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
were going to originally the concept was
 
04:04:26.269 --> 04:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
they were going to come up with a menu
 
04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
of mandates that were going to be uh
 
04:04:30.950 --> 04:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
consistent and through throughout the
 
04:04:33.429 --> 04:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
country and and then they've realized
 
04:04:35.389 --> 04:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
that that was extremely problematic
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
because every state had different
 
04:04:41.510 --> 04:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
mandates had different elements so they
 
04:04:44.229 --> 04:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
um you could call it the Kick the Can
 
04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
down the road what they said instead was
 
04:04:49.309 --> 04:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
that um okay each state is stuck with
 
04:04:51.189 --> 04:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
the mandates that they
 
04:04:55.389 --> 04:04:55.399 align:start position:0%
have and that after going forward if you
 
04:04:57.349 --> 04:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
want to pass a new health insurance
 
04:04:59.630 --> 04:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
mandate uh and this may be reason why we
 
04:05:02.510 --> 04:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
haven't seen too many since then uh is
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
that the state would have to pay for the
 
04:05:09.870 --> 04:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
Mandate so the Sation that I I guess I
 
04:05:13.469 --> 04:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
had you know I I knew that the uh small
 
04:05:17.149 --> 04:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
employer you know was was uh 2 to
 
04:05:19.710 --> 04:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
50 in New Hampshire we actually we were
 
04:05:21.189 --> 04:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
one that was we were kind of
 
04:05:23.389 --> 04:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
controversial with our 1 to 50 but but
 
04:05:27.229 --> 04:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
we that it was 2 to 50 and then and then
 
04:05:28.830 --> 04:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
um when our what we call our fully
 
04:05:32.469 --> 04:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
insured Market um was large employers
 
04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
are 51 and and up so saying that uh so I
 
04:05:38.910 --> 04:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
guess this is a a Learning lesson for
 
04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
everyone if you see a health insurance
 
04:05:45.149 --> 04:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
mandate be aware that you're not
 
04:05:47.550 --> 04:05:47.560 align:start position:0%
affecting the small employer or the
 
04:05:50.070 --> 04:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
individuals which is really ones who
 
04:05:51.830 --> 04:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
would be hurt the most by any new
 
04:05:54.469 --> 04:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
mandate in terms of Premium increase but
 
04:05:58.149 --> 04:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
that um is only into employers that are
 
04:06:01.750 --> 04:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
51 or greater that have not switched to
 
04:06:04.429 --> 04:06:04.439 align:start position:0%
an Arisa plan that they are just still
 
04:06:06.830 --> 04:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
in the fully insured Market which we
 
04:06:09.070 --> 04:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
just learned there are two 130 some
 
04:06:12.030 --> 04:06:12.040 align:start position:0%
businesses who were in that which yeah
 
04:06:15.429 --> 04:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
excuse me so and that's that's a good
 
04:06:16.990 --> 04:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
you know that's good
 
04:06:19.630 --> 04:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
20 whatever States population million
 
04:06:22.389 --> 04:06:22.399 align:start position:0%
six so that's a you know a pretty high
 
04:06:22.399 --> 04:06:23.910 align:start position:0%
six so that's a you know a pretty high
number

04:06:23.910 --> 04:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:06:29.429 --> 04:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
so okay uh who would like to uh make an
 
04:06:32.429 --> 04:06:32.439 align:start position:0%
an expedient legislation motion okay
 
04:06:33.990 --> 04:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative Terry anybody want to
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
Second it represent
 
04:06:36.800 --> 04:06:42.870 align:start position:0%
Second it represent
collabro

04:06:42.870 --> 04:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion of
 
04:06:46.830 --> 04:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate seeing none all
 
04:06:50.189 --> 04:06:50.199 align:start position:0%

okay all
 
04:07:09.110 --> 04:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
right next up uh Senate bill 35 relative

04:07:20.070 --> 04:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:22.229 --> 04:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
okay and you guys have been spending a
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
lot of time working on this I
 
04:07:26.429 --> 04:07:26.439 align:start position:0%
hope right
 
04:07:32.109 --> 04:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.389 --> 04:07:36.399 align:start position:0%
so and others is is Alex when is his
 
04:07:38.910 --> 04:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
convers off by budget or how do how do
 
04:07:41.510 --> 04:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
we how do we handle consultants in our
 
04:07:44.109 --> 04:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
in our budget it's part of the secret
 
04:07:47.590 --> 04:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
sauce Mr chairman I consider Alex to be
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
a uh successfully failed retiree failed
 
04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
at trying to retire
 
04:07:57.870 --> 04:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
right so yeah there was um a good amount
 
04:08:04.109 --> 04:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
of work um done on this bill um we felt
 
04:08:07.710 --> 04:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
we had a mandate from this committee um
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
to see what we could do by bringing the
 
04:08:14.070 --> 04:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together both the carriers
 
04:08:17.389 --> 04:08:17.399 align:start position:0%
and uh mental health providers who um
 
04:08:21.149 --> 04:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
were trying to uh bill under this
 
04:08:25.229 --> 04:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
Primary Care behavioral health model of
 
04:08:28.189 --> 04:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
care wow you really you're kind of
 
04:08:31.710 --> 04:08:31.720 align:start position:0%
mellowed in your old age that was always
 
04:08:34.109 --> 04:08:34.119 align:start position:0%
you were so much louder when you were
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
when you were the deputy
 
04:08:36.600 --> 04:08:38.309 align:start position:0%
when you were the deputy
dog

04:08:38.309 --> 04:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
dog
 
04:08:41.790 --> 04:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
okay um there was good representation in
 
04:08:44.349 --> 04:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
the working group both from uh Mental
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
Health Providers and from the carriers
 
04:08:51.309 --> 04:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
and um a spirit of uh collaboration so
 
04:08:54.349 --> 04:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
it was kind of fun to work with this
 
04:08:58.950 --> 04:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
group um the problem um that seems to
 
04:09:01.229 --> 04:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
have been occurring which we verified in
 
04:09:03.309 --> 04:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the claims data there was a
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
fairly High denial rate for the specific
 
04:09:09.750 --> 04:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
codes um that were being build for this
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
service um is that uh some of the codes
 
04:09:17.469 --> 04:09:17.479 align:start position:0%
are quite new this model of care is new
 
04:09:22.269 --> 04:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
um and uh it's not easy to build
 
04:09:25.950 --> 04:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
correctly or to um process the bills
 
04:09:30.590 --> 04:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
correctly uh because it's a new thing um
 
04:09:33.510 --> 04:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
so we identified that as one of the
 
04:09:38.189 --> 04:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
issues and then uh there was um
 
04:09:41.630 --> 04:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
a subset or one issue in particular uh
 
04:09:44.030 --> 04:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
that seemed to be causing the most
 
04:09:47.630 --> 04:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
problem uh which was that um a lot of
 
04:09:51.590 --> 04:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
these bills that were developed uh by
 
04:09:55.229 --> 04:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
those entities that um develop these
 
04:10:00.790 --> 04:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
codes um set up uh this mechanism where
 
04:10:02.189 --> 04:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
payment uh has to be or the bill has to
 
04:10:07.229 --> 04:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
be submitted by the billing provider
 
04:10:10.030 --> 04:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
which which um in this model would be
 
04:10:12.590 --> 04:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
the um primary care
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
provider um and uh that makes it
 
04:10:19.109 --> 04:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
difficult for someone who uh for example
 
04:10:21.309 --> 04:10:21.319 align:start position:0%
just has a contractual relationship with
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
the primary care provider which is one
 
04:10:26.990 --> 04:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
way of setting up this model uh to then
 
04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
have to build only through that provider
 
04:10:36.189 --> 04:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
is um difficult um so we identified some
 
04:10:38.349 --> 04:10:38.359 align:start position:0%
codes that we believe believe can be
 
04:10:40.229 --> 04:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
used for billing
 
04:10:45.429 --> 04:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
directly and um we are we have a
 
04:10:49.070 --> 04:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
bulletin that the department will issue
 
04:10:51.870 --> 04:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
um basically providing instruction to
 
04:10:55.790 --> 04:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
the carriers to make a special effort to
 
04:10:57.870 --> 04:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
review the claims that are coming in
 
04:11:01.590 --> 04:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
associated with this care model um to
 
04:11:04.469 --> 04:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
identify issues and most importantly to
 
04:11:08.269 --> 04:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
reach out to the providers and uh um
 
04:11:11.229 --> 04:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are making clear
 
04:11:15.149 --> 04:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
what the uh procedure is for building
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
under these new
 
04:11:20.429 --> 04:11:20.439 align:start position:0%
codes so that's the
 
04:11:22.630 --> 04:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
plan thank you Mr chairman what I would
 
04:11:24.349 --> 04:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
add to that and the reason why I wanted
 
04:11:27.910 --> 04:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
to come up here is to share with you
 
04:11:30.070 --> 04:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
what that bulletin process is I don't
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
think we've had an opportunity to talk
 
04:11:33.149 --> 04:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
about that in any of the times that the
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
department has appeared before the
 
04:11:37.670 --> 04:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
committee so as all of you well know try
 
04:11:39.630 --> 04:11:39.640 align:start position:0%
as hard as you might when you craft a
 
04:11:42.550 --> 04:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation when you put a new
 
04:11:44.750 --> 04:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
statute into effect it's impossible in
 
04:11:46.870 --> 04:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
all circumstances to get it exactly
 
04:11:49.389 --> 04:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
right which is why you all have the Jael
 
04:11:51.269 --> 04:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
car process which helps to smooth out
 
04:11:52.750 --> 04:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
the rough edges to help with the
 
04:11:55.469 --> 04:11:55.479 align:start position:0%
implementation process uh to build up
 
04:11:57.790 --> 04:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
the structure around that law to ensure
 
04:12:00.109 --> 04:12:00.119 align:start position:0%
that you are achieving what was intended
 
04:12:00.990 --> 04:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:12:04.429 --> 04:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
statute for Regulators for us we have
 
04:12:06.149 --> 04:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
another tool that can help with that
 
04:12:07.710 --> 04:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
process and it's called the bullet
 
04:12:10.590 --> 04:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
process and so while it does not have
 
04:12:12.790 --> 04:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
the effect of Law and while we do not
 
04:12:14.830 --> 04:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
have to come before the legislature to
 
04:12:17.070 --> 04:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
achieve it what it essentially amounts
 
04:12:19.710 --> 04:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
to is based off of the statute or the
 
04:12:22.109 --> 04:12:22.119 align:start position:0%
rule if there is a rule in place for
 
04:12:25.229 --> 04:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
this this is how the department is going
 
04:12:27.990 --> 04:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
to interpret the most appropriate way
 
04:12:30.389 --> 04:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
for us to regulate this particular
 
04:12:33.389 --> 04:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
statute or Rule and so what Alex was
 
04:12:36.030 --> 04:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
able to do was to bring the stakeholders
 
04:12:38.670 --> 04:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
together in a very collaborative of way
 
04:12:41.189 --> 04:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
and say we can actually achieve this by
 
04:12:43.710 --> 04:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
the department clarifying how it wants
 
04:12:46.750 --> 04:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
this process to go forward and so the
 
04:12:49.030 --> 04:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
beauty of that is we can issue that
 
04:12:51.750 --> 04:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
bulletin at any moment and it will go
 
04:12:54.269 --> 04:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
into effect at that moment and hopefully
 
04:12:56.269 --> 04:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
we can start to iron out some of the
 
04:12:58.030 --> 04:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
issues here I will tell you that this is
 
04:13:00.469 --> 04:13:00.479 align:start position:0%
not the only circumstance where we have
 
04:13:02.950 --> 04:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
seen this type of thing uh the state has
 
04:13:04.510 --> 04:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
brought on a number of different
 
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
Services uh over the past several years
 
04:13:10.229 --> 04:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
um that need to have that billing
 
04:13:11.870 --> 04:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
process ironed out and so I think what
 
04:13:13.269 --> 04:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
we've done here is created a very
 
04:13:16.189 --> 04:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
successful model for us to go forward
 
04:13:17.870 --> 04:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
and address some of these other issues
 
04:13:22.830 --> 04:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:25.469 --> 04:13:25.479 align:start position:0%
Arenas I I I would have to say that I
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
too have urged you guys to do a
 
04:13:30.630 --> 04:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
bulletins over the years and and usually
 
04:13:32.349 --> 04:13:32.359 align:start position:0%
would it's it's a it's a procedural
 
04:13:34.229 --> 04:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
thing and it's just letting the
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
companies know exactly how they should
 
04:13:37.870 --> 04:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
handle it
 
04:13:42.349 --> 04:13:42.359 align:start position:0%
and so so yes representa Terry so would
 
04:13:44.670 --> 04:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
it be correct for me to understand that
 
04:13:47.269 --> 04:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
in your conversations with the parties
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
involved in this issue that all are are
 
04:13:53.429 --> 04:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
satisfied if not in agreement that this
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
is the way to
 
04:13:59.550 --> 04:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
proceed yeah I I think there's um a good
 
04:14:02.670 --> 04:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
consensus that um this is a good way to
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
proceed uh we're doing taking the
 
04:14:07.630 --> 04:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
unusual step um
 
04:14:10.389 --> 04:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
in this case of circulating a draft
 
04:14:13.990 --> 04:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
bulletin with that group to make sure
 
04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
that um we have that um consensus good
 
04:14:21.309 --> 04:14:21.319 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and having said that
 
04:14:24.870 --> 04:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking at John who is the
 
04:14:31.109 --> 04:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
my uh best way to handle a situation
 
04:14:36.109 --> 04:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
like this is that uh we will um interim
 
04:14:38.670 --> 04:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
study the bill and so that a year from
 
04:14:40.830 --> 04:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
now you can come back and uh when we
 
04:14:42.910 --> 04:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
when we take up interim studies you can
 
04:14:45.870 --> 04:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
come back and tell us or John can tell
 
04:14:48.590 --> 04:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
us what what has been the outcome of
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
this bulletin and whether it's it's been
 
04:14:54.309 --> 04:14:54.319 align:start position:0%
as successful as we would hope
 
04:14:54.319 --> 04:14:56.870 align:start position:0%
as successful as we would hope
so

04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:14:59.550 --> 04:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much John you want
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:06.000 --> 04:15:09.910 align:start position:0%
 
in

04:15:09.910 --> 04:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:11.349 --> 04:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
me of
 
04:15:13.269 --> 04:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chair members of
 
04:15:14.269 --> 04:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
04:15:15.630 --> 04:15:15.640 align:start position:0%
John dejoy I'm representing the New
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Psychological Association and
 
04:15:19.349 --> 04:15:19.359 align:start position:0%
and what the commissioner and Alex have
 
04:15:22.149 --> 04:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
just uh outlined is we agree with
 
04:15:25.349 --> 04:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
completely uh we we my client is
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
requesting that we not go to interim
 
04:15:28.830 --> 04:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
study just yet we would like to see the
 
04:15:33.269 --> 04:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
draft bolon because they if depending on
 
04:15:34.910 --> 04:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
the draft bullet if we're able to iron
 
04:15:37.349 --> 04:15:37.359 align:start position:0%
everything out which we think we have
 
04:15:40.670 --> 04:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
have um we're happy to either inm study
 
04:15:43.229 --> 04:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
or kill the bill at that point however
 
04:15:47.269 --> 04:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
if not then they want to keep open the
 
04:15:49.070 --> 04:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
option for a couple more weeks to move
 
04:15:52.349 --> 04:15:52.359 align:start position:0%
the bill forward it is our expectation
 
04:15:53.950 --> 04:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
that the bullton will resolve things
 
04:15:56.149 --> 04:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
once we can see the draft that is the
 
04:15:58.950 --> 04:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
expectation we're working
 
04:16:01.830 --> 04:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
under okay so how long will you guys
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:05.920 --> 04:16:10.750 align:start position:0%
 
Bulletin

04:16:10.750 --> 04:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:13.790 --> 04:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
days okay because so we're we're
 
04:16:16.229 --> 04:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
scheduling to exact this bill on the 7th
 
04:16:16.239 --> 04:16:17.950 align:start position:0%
scheduling to exact this bill on the 7th
November

04:16:17.950 --> 04:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
November
 
04:16:17.960 --> 04:16:20.550 align:start position:0%
November
7th

04:16:20.550 --> 04:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
7th
 
04:16:23.229 --> 04:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
so bulletin should be on the
 
04:16:26.229 --> 04:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
street as I said please don't hear this
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
as expecting an adverse outcome we
 
04:16:31.149 --> 04:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
expect a positive outcome it's just my
 
04:16:32.590 --> 04:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
client would like to see The Bu front
 
04:16:35.070 --> 04:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
you like to see the eyes dotted and the
 
04:16:37.990 --> 04:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
t's crossed okay okay so we'll we'll
 
04:16:40.790 --> 04:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
hold up for our final uh decision on
 
04:16:40.800 --> 04:16:42.030 align:start position:0%
hold up for our final uh decision on
that

04:16:42.030 --> 04:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
come come November
 
04:16:48.990 --> 04:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
7th okay all right that's fine we can
 
04:16:52.229 --> 04:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
hold off no
 
04:16:52.239 --> 04:16:54.070 align:start position:0%
hold off no
problem

04:16:54.070 --> 04:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:16:57.510 --> 04:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
um I mean I guess we
 
04:16:59.550 --> 04:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
could because we're gonna come back
 
04:17:01.349 --> 04:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to come back and I mean I
 
04:17:03.149 --> 04:17:03.159 align:start position:0%
but I wouldn't schedule another com so
 
04:17:04.870 --> 04:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
so let's just do let's do the interim
 
04:17:07.469 --> 04:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
study motion but that if the bulletin
 
04:17:11.149 --> 04:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
comes out and and if it's okay um you
 
04:17:12.990 --> 04:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
know so let's take up the inter room
 
04:17:15.870 --> 04:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
study so so I move um interim study
 
04:17:20.550 --> 04:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:24.389 --> 04:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
cabro before we vote question yes
 
04:17:28.030 --> 04:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
so by taking this tact of interim
 
04:17:31.149 --> 04:17:31.159 align:start position:0%
studying it yeah it it's easier to
 
04:17:33.950 --> 04:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
withdraw it on the 7th rather than to
 
04:17:35.950 --> 04:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
well does to make a motion to interim
 
04:17:37.590 --> 04:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
study it on the 7th
 
04:17:39.870 --> 04:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
right we generally generally six to one
 
04:17:41.469 --> 04:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
half doesn't the other I mean you're
 
04:17:42.710 --> 04:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
preferring that we enter and study it
 
04:17:44.830 --> 04:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
and then withdraw it if everything works
 
04:17:47.189 --> 04:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
out exactly thank you
 
04:17:50.229 --> 04:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
yeah okay is the motion clear all those
 
04:17:55.469 --> 04:17:55.479 align:start position:0%
in favor say I those opposed so move
 
04:17:55.479 --> 04:17:57.510 align:start position:0%
in favor say I those opposed so move
unanimously

04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
unanimously
 
04:17:59.510 --> 04:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
04:18:02.189 --> 04:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
right let me just
 
04:18:02.199 --> 04:18:05.710 align:start position:0%
right let me just
make

04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:05.720 --> 04:18:10.149 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:18:10.149 --> 04:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:13.590 --> 04:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay um relative to insurance coverage
 
04:18:16.950 --> 04:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
for Pain Management Services
 
04:18:19.550 --> 04:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
303 represent
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
collabro I would like to bring new life
 
04:18:25.189 --> 04:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
into this bill I have talked to um its
 
04:18:25.199 --> 04:18:26.429 align:start position:0%
into this bill I have talked to um its
sponsors

04:18:26.429 --> 04:18:26.439 align:start position:0%
sponsors
 
04:18:29.830 --> 04:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
today um what I've taken the time to do
 
04:18:31.550 --> 04:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
most of the summer is basically working
 
04:18:34.910 --> 04:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
on HB 66 which is a study to study the
 
04:18:37.309 --> 04:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
integrative uh model of collaborative
 
04:18:39.469 --> 04:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
medicine for chronic pain in the state
 
04:18:39.479 --> 04:18:40.469 align:start position:0%
medicine for chronic pain in the state
non-

04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
non-
 
04:18:43.109 --> 04:18:43.119 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutically what you have is five
 
04:18:45.750 --> 04:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
members of the House and Senate
 
04:18:48.349 --> 04:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
basically sitting there um every two
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
weeks doing research about this and some
 
04:18:52.710 --> 04:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
of us have gone offsite and done some
 
04:18:55.510 --> 04:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
research to find out how can we in
 
04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
bottom line is make this efficient
 
04:19:01.269 --> 04:19:01.279 align:start position:0%
effective reduce emergency room visits
 
04:19:03.109 --> 04:19:03.119 align:start position:0%
reduce the stress on providers like
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
myself and keep them from retiring
 
04:19:07.990 --> 04:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
really young and and allow us to have
 
04:19:10.149 --> 04:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
some solutions here and it becomes very
 
04:19:13.229 --> 04:19:13.239 align:start position:0%
obvious over time that the economic
 
04:19:16.590 --> 04:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
model of expanding care to include those
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
licenses um medical licenses in the
 
04:19:22.269 --> 04:19:22.279 align:start position:0%
state for those supportive systems
 
04:19:24.030 --> 04:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
they're less invasive they have better
 
04:19:26.469 --> 04:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
efficacy they cost less and in UVM it
 
04:19:27.950 --> 04:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
showed us very
 
04:19:31.349 --> 04:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
plainly that six months of operation
 
04:19:32.670 --> 04:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
within their chronic Integrative
 
04:19:35.590 --> 04:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
Medicine model and there are only 10 per
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
um 10 participants in that of that six
 
04:19:41.750 --> 04:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
month study that was the same cost as
 
04:19:45.389 --> 04:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
one and a half epidural injections as a
 
04:19:47.870 --> 04:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
PCP I find out that people have chronic
 
04:19:49.269 --> 04:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
pain because of how many times they've
 
04:19:51.389 --> 04:19:51.399 align:start position:0%
gone to urgent care emergency rooms how
 
04:19:53.070 --> 04:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
many time has been wasted how they're
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
abusing the
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
vicadin I see this from the other side
 
04:20:02.149 --> 04:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
and so I'm trying to open this channel
 
04:20:04.630 --> 04:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
of treatment options for everybody
 
04:20:06.990 --> 04:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
without a mandate because I think in
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
time they're going to see what I already
 
04:20:11.109 --> 04:20:11.119 align:start position:0%
know with my degree in community health
 
04:20:14.030 --> 04:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
and psychology and in medicine that this
 
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
is a better model it's more effective
 
04:20:19.149 --> 04:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
it's going to free up a lot of things
 
04:20:21.590 --> 04:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to save marriages and I could
 
04:20:23.229 --> 04:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
tell you that the coorbit disorders
 
04:20:26.189 --> 04:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
associated with chronic pain obesity
 
04:20:28.710 --> 04:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
diabetes congestive heart failure we are
 
04:20:32.189 --> 04:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
tackling all of that now me as the
 
04:20:34.070 --> 04:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis medical lead of the state
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to save
 
04:20:40.189 --> 04:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
lives I want to save people from bik and
 
04:20:43.109 --> 04:20:43.119 align:start position:0%
when they lose their jobs and lose their
 
04:20:45.429 --> 04:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
insurance and can no longer see their
 
04:20:47.510 --> 04:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
pcps that they don't turn to the street
 
04:20:47.520 --> 04:20:48.469 align:start position:0%
pcps that they don't turn to the street
for

04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:20:50.670 --> 04:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
fentel and that's what I'm hoping to
 
04:20:52.830 --> 04:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
accomplish with this now I spoke to the
 
04:20:55.630 --> 04:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
members of this committee who are not in
 
04:20:58.070 --> 04:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
the same party as me and they are all in
 
04:21:00.510 --> 04:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
agreement with what we are trying to do
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
here and I would like to see the
 
04:21:03.510 --> 04:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
insurance companies do the right thing
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
in time I know a lot of them have
 
04:21:07.149 --> 04:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
already seen that
 
04:21:08.830 --> 04:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
and they see that the benefits can be
 
04:21:12.189 --> 04:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
helpful but I want to limit what we
 
04:21:15.750 --> 04:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
permit there has to be guard rails and
 
04:21:17.670 --> 04:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
that includes lure for the state if they
 
04:21:20.229 --> 04:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
deemed us capable of practicing medicine
 
04:21:22.670 --> 04:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
we should be reimbursed for it now I
 
04:21:24.189 --> 04:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
won't get into how much that fee for
 
04:21:25.510 --> 04:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
service is because if you knew
 
04:21:27.750 --> 04:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
acupuncture only yielded $18 per
 
04:21:29.189 --> 04:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
injection you would know that that's not
 
04:21:31.429 --> 04:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
a very affordable sustainable model but
 
04:21:33.149 --> 04:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to tackle with HB
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
66 not with
 
04:21:40.030 --> 04:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:42.790 --> 04:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
you would you like to make a
 
04:21:46.189 --> 04:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
motion I would love for us to take it
 
04:21:50.830 --> 04:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:53.630 --> 04:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
seventh sorry I would move to interim
 
04:21:56.830 --> 04:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
study no we are not talking about an
 
04:21:58.830 --> 04:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
interim study we want to move forward on
 
04:22:03.229 --> 04:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
it I told you I got the entire group to
 
04:22:07.269 --> 04:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
agree do we move forward with it non-man
 
04:22:09.990 --> 04:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
ated but as
 
04:22:13.710 --> 04:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:15.790 --> 04:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
Amendments okay I guess if you that's
 
04:22:16.910 --> 04:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
what you were trying to tell me earlier
 
04:22:19.149 --> 04:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I totally missed that um the
 
04:22:21.469 --> 04:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
the sponsor asked me to in and he
 
04:22:23.429 --> 04:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
corrected his CH changed it which is
 
04:22:26.269 --> 04:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
what I told you before we came in here
 
04:22:28.590 --> 04:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
he does not want to put it into interim
 
04:22:31.830 --> 04:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
study he wants us to move forward he
 
04:22:35.950 --> 04:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
agreed yeah well okay well we're a long
 
04:22:38.189 --> 04:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
way I mean when I when I plugged in the
 
04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
bill and pulled up the bill and said
 
04:22:45.429 --> 04:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
change all the all the no shs to he sent
 
04:22:47.830 --> 04:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
it he sent it to us a few weeks ago the
 
04:22:50.349 --> 04:22:50.359 align:start position:0%
amended bill yeah but I I took what he
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
sent me and I turned all the shs to May
 
04:22:55.790 --> 04:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
there was 25 of
 
04:22:58.630 --> 04:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
them that's what I I but we didn't get
 
04:23:00.550 --> 04:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
that amend we have we don't have that
 
04:23:02.950 --> 04:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment what do you mean we don't have
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment that says
 
04:23:08.189 --> 04:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
May you need the amend I thought he'd
 
04:23:10.389 --> 04:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
send that into OSS okay I'll get him to
 
04:23:13.990 --> 04:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
do that but that's that is what we had
 
04:23:14.000 --> 04:23:14.790 align:start position:0%
do that but that's that is what we had
talked

04:23:14.790 --> 04:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
talked
 
04:23:18.349 --> 04:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
about well he obviously I you saying he
 
04:23:20.189 --> 04:23:20.199 align:start position:0%
tried to call me or talking no he sent
 
04:23:21.910 --> 04:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
the corrected amended and you corrected
 
04:23:23.670 --> 04:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
it but I never got those revisions from
 
04:23:23.680 --> 04:23:25.189 align:start position:0%
it but I never got those revisions from
you

04:23:25.189 --> 04:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:23:28.429 --> 04:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
no I I don't think
 
04:23:31.710 --> 04:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
so who's on
 
04:23:31.720 --> 04:23:34.590 align:start position:0%
so who's on
[Music]

04:23:34.590 --> 04:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:23:37.149 --> 04:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
first yeah I I
 
04:23:40.550 --> 04:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't I mean at this at this point he he
 
04:23:43.229 --> 04:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
told me to interum study the bill and he
 
04:23:45.510 --> 04:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
changed that when I told him that we had
 
04:23:48.429 --> 04:23:48.439 align:start position:0%
support here from other people and that
 
04:23:50.349 --> 04:23:50.359 align:start position:0%
we would not mandate conversation with
 
04:23:51.790 --> 04:23:51.800 align:start position:0%
him that we and I had that conversation
 
04:23:53.189 --> 04:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
when we walked in here and I tried to
 
04:23:54.990 --> 04:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
explain to you that he would like to
 
04:23:56.550 --> 04:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
pull this spell out of retention Gary
 
04:23:57.790 --> 04:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
Merchant would like to pull this spell
 
04:23:59.229 --> 04:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
out of retention Dave lungren would like
 
04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
to pull this spell out of retention and
 
04:24:01.630 --> 04:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
I would like to pull the spell out of
 
04:24:03.790 --> 04:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
attention we're trying to expand healthc
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
care access without a mandate I don't
 
04:24:07.550 --> 04:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
see that being complicated
 
04:24:07.560 --> 04:24:09.910 align:start position:0%
see that being complicated
thing

04:24:09.910 --> 04:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:24:12.990 --> 04:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
Well here here's the problem what the
 
04:24:13.000 --> 04:24:14.830 align:start position:0%
Well here here's the problem what the
bill

04:24:14.830 --> 04:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:24:18.149 --> 04:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
does even if even if we turn everything
 
04:24:24.070 --> 04:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
into May okay is a whole new process
 
04:24:26.910 --> 04:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
procedure and what he told me was that
 
04:24:30.389 --> 04:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
he he they wanted to pursue that in ' 66
 
04:24:33.750 --> 04:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
we are we're just let's work on the
 
04:24:35.870 --> 04:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
wording and the amendment let's take
 
04:24:37.070 --> 04:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
what whatever it is that you're
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
contending without out but that is
 
04:24:40.550 --> 04:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
essentially what he wants to see happen
 
04:24:42.510 --> 04:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
is that we limit it to 12 visits that we
 
04:24:44.229 --> 04:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
include those professions that have the
 
04:24:44.239 --> 04:24:45.389 align:start position:0%
include those professions that have the
license

04:24:45.389 --> 04:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:24:48.550 --> 04:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
sure and that we not make it a mandate
 
04:24:51.550 --> 04:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
the How We Do It Is HP 66's Legacy well
 
04:24:54.030 --> 04:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
but the whole idea is this whole new way
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
of looking at Health that's HB 66's
 
04:24:59.309 --> 04:24:59.319 align:start position:0%
Legacy not this part that was what we
 
04:24:59.319 --> 04:25:03.429 align:start position:0%
Legacy not this part that was what we
talked

04:25:03.429 --> 04:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
about uh Mr chairman so uh so how do how
 
04:25:10.910 --> 04:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
how how does how do the two relate then
 
04:25:12.510 --> 04:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
why is one necessary for the other I
 
04:25:14.750 --> 04:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
mean just just for illumination so that
 
04:25:16.469 --> 04:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
some of us on this side who are right
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
now trying to understand what's going on
 
04:25:21.710 --> 04:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
here I mean it's it's it's so confusing
 
04:25:24.870 --> 04:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
I'll just be right now gener if I
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
were to for me to address chronic pain
 
04:25:29.590 --> 04:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
for a patient I have three or four
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
people I can call in my tools in my tool
 
04:25:33.630 --> 04:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
belt okay what we're trying to do is
 
04:25:35.590 --> 04:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
expand with those codes whatever those
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
things for that chronic pain that we
 
04:25:39.510 --> 04:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
extend it to various other entities who
 
04:25:41.109 --> 04:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
are licensed through the state as well
 
04:25:43.510 --> 04:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
acupuncture Chiropractic most insurance
 
04:25:46.389 --> 04:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
companies are starting to include that
 
04:25:47.710 --> 04:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
but not all of
 
04:25:50.349 --> 04:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
them they're more effective Solutions
 
04:25:52.630 --> 04:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes shorter quicker res resolution
 
04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
and avoidance of er might follow up so
 
04:25:57.830 --> 04:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm still trying to understand the
 
04:26:00.269 --> 04:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
relationship between the two bills and
 
04:26:02.950 --> 04:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
how they relate to each other HB 66 was
 
04:26:02.960 --> 04:26:04.830 align:start position:0%
how they relate to each other HB 66 was
mandated

04:26:04.830 --> 04:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
04:26:07.830 --> 04:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
by what I've been asked to do by the
 
04:26:09.830 --> 04:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
speaker is essentially find a model for
 
04:26:12.349 --> 04:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
the state to deal with collaborative
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
medicine um to deal with chronic pain we
 
04:26:18.070 --> 04:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
are trying to do that it's a bipartisan
 
04:26:20.309 --> 04:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
effort these stakeholders here today are
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
there for that particular committee as
 
04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
well and the research that we're doing
 
04:26:26.910 --> 04:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
is basically trying to figure out how to
 
04:26:28.710 --> 04:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
solve that problem for the state I
 
04:26:30.149 --> 04:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
highly doubt we'll get it done by
 
04:26:31.670 --> 04:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
December we will probably extend it
 
04:26:34.349 --> 04:26:34.359 align:start position:0%
through the following year and work on
 
04:26:37.309 --> 04:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
that as creating a collaborative model
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
what this is trying to extend is
 
04:26:42.309 --> 04:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
coverage for those services for chronic
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
pain to include the other
 
04:26:48.990 --> 04:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
providers okay but not mandate the costs
 
04:26:51.070 --> 04:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
and not mandate that they have to cover
 
04:26:53.590 --> 04:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
it in time they'll see that it is useful
 
04:26:56.070 --> 04:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
and it is going to save them money and
 
04:26:57.830 --> 04:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
that it is a more efficient model
 
04:27:01.109 --> 04:27:01.119 align:start position:0%
research has shown that since um 2010 so
 
04:27:01.910 --> 04:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know how long you want to
 
04:27:04.429 --> 04:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
prolong this we're in brief recess for
 
04:27:07.830 --> 04:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
five minutes while I call call
 
04:27:09.469 --> 04:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
Dave Nel I have this
 
04:27:11.990 --> 04:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
number so are these so like the
 
04:27:14.710 --> 04:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists and whatever are they not
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
now covered they're not considered
 
04:27:20.870 --> 04:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
providers so this bill wants to consider
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
wants to make it but not mandate that
 
04:27:25.149 --> 04:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
they be provid because now we're going
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
from Shell to May that's right so so so
 
04:27:33.429 --> 04:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
isn't this still then very if May
 
04:27:35.590 --> 04:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
becomes permissive so what are we
 
04:27:35.600 --> 04:27:37.109 align:start position:0%
becomes permissive so what are we
accomplish

04:27:37.109 --> 04:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
04:27:39.830 --> 04:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
by making this permissive because it's
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
opening the
 
04:27:44.269 --> 04:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
door what we already know so so are you
 
04:27:46.469 --> 04:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
saying they need nudges these the
 
04:27:46.479 --> 04:27:54.070 align:start position:0%
saying they need nudges these the
insurance

04:27:54.070 --> 04:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:57.550 --> 04:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
people I don't want any
 
04:28:00.590 --> 04:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
insurance I want to come to
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:04.840 --> 04:28:12.309 align:start position:0%
 
in

04:28:12.309 --> 04:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:14.750 --> 04:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
so why don't we have one bill instead of
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
two it makes it more complicated to have
 
04:28:19.790 --> 04:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
one bill instead of two no to make two
 
04:28:23.070 --> 04:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
bills well no well no actually you're no
 
04:28:24.349 --> 04:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
actually you're describing what's going
 
04:28:28.510 --> 04:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:30.269 --> 04:28:30.279 align:start position:0%
complicated so we want to have a
 
04:28:31.710 --> 04:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
collaborative model but we don't want to
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
mandate it on the insurance companies we
 
04:28:36.550 --> 04:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
want them to do it but we need to use
 
04:28:39.429 --> 04:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
language like May which is an effect of
 
04:28:41.429 --> 04:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
which is therefore has the effect of a
 
04:28:44.189 --> 04:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
resolution right a resolution which says
 
04:28:47.229 --> 04:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
this is the sense of the legisl the
 
04:28:48.750 --> 04:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
legislature has the sense that this is
 
04:28:50.189 --> 04:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
where we would like you to go we're not
 
04:28:52.910 --> 04:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
mandating you to do this at this point
 
04:28:55.950 --> 04:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
04:28:58.269 --> 04:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
well from a favorable point of view
 
04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
would say this is quite elegant this
 
04:29:02.229 --> 04:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
procedure on the other hand I would say
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's some
 
04:29:04.720 --> 04:29:06.269 align:start position:0%
it's some
convoluted

04:29:06.269 --> 04:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
convoluted
 
04:29:14.469 --> 04:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:16.830 --> 04:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
side okay so what what I would like to
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.720 --> 04:30:04.630 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:30:04.640 --> 04:30:07.710 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:30:07.710 --> 04:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:11.309 --> 04:30:11.319 align:start position:0%

04:31:09.680 --> 04:31:13.870 align:start position:0%
are visuals
[Laughter]

we got to help our uh tree tree Paper
 
04:31:29.189 --> 04:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
Industries here look all the paper we we
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
just have PowerPoint that's right he was
 
04:31:32.630 --> 04:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
asking me for he was asking for a
 
04:31:34.229 --> 04:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint and I said no there's no
 
04:31:36.710 --> 04:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint we got no stinking power
 
04:31:38.630 --> 04:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
points is this recycled paper or is this
 
04:31:41.830 --> 04:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
a virgin no I it's you know Jean

04:31:51.229 --> 04:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:53.830 --> 04:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
help that sounds like Jean yeah that
 
04:31:55.590 --> 04:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
sounds like Jean that's why I beat them
 
04:31:58.590 --> 04:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
there there's just too many trees I know
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:10.670 --> 04:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:12.910 --> 04:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
out yeah you know we throw everything
 
04:32:17.750 --> 04:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:19.990 --> 04:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
glass you drive into the transfer
 
04:32:22.149 --> 04:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
station and all this is recycling
 
04:32:24.910 --> 04:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory it's got all that glass paper
 
04:32:27.990 --> 04:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
whatever and then it says all right only
 
04:32:30.109 --> 04:32:30.119 align:start position:0%

beton Court I have the pleasure serving
 
04:32:34.830 --> 04:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
04:32:36.550 --> 04:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
insurance department Department you have
 
04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
met Michelle previously you have met
 
04:32:41.790 --> 04:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
Alex previously but wisely hiding
 
04:32:43.389 --> 04:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the back there is Jason
 
04:32:44.910 --> 04:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
Dexter the head of our life and health
 
04:32:47.630 --> 04:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
Division and collectively they have put
 
04:32:49.510 --> 04:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
this afternoon's presentation together
 
04:32:52.710 --> 04:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
for you as we promis that we would while
 
04:32:54.990 --> 04:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
today's discussion is
 
04:32:57.990 --> 04:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
obenson a bill 82 which is prompt
 
04:32:59.189 --> 04:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
payment of
 
04:33:01.870 --> 04:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
claims we appreciate and we hope as a
 
04:33:03.710 --> 04:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
result of this presentation that you
 
04:33:05.830 --> 04:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
will appreciate that there there are
 
04:33:08.789 --> 04:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
deeper underlying currents at play that
 
04:33:11.150 --> 04:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
have prompted this legislation beyond
 
04:33:14.551 --> 04:33:14.561 align:start position:0%
the narrow definition of prompt pay and
 
04:33:16.349 --> 04:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
so therefore we have crafted a
 
04:33:19.029 --> 04:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
presentation that hopefully provides you
 
04:33:21.070 --> 04:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
with some of the critical information
 
04:33:22.949 --> 04:33:22.959 align:start position:0%
about the core issues that many of you
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
indicated to us that you have been
 
04:33:24.480 --> 04:33:25.429 align:start position:0%
indicated to us that you have been
hearing

04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:33:28.269 --> 04:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
about as you will hear under the narrow
 
04:33:31.390 --> 04:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
definition of prompt pay there are no
 
04:33:34.390 --> 04:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
issues in New Hampshire our carriers are
 
04:33:36.390 --> 04:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
paying claims slightly faster than the
 
04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
national average that being said at the
 
04:33:42.551 --> 04:33:42.561 align:start position:0%
same time we know that there are issues
 
04:33:45.470 --> 04:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
with varying degrees of prominence which
 
04:33:48.349 --> 04:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
account with accounts receivable that
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
carriers owe to
 
04:33:53.150 --> 04:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
Providers therefore I believe we can
 
04:33:56.029 --> 04:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
logically deduce that the issue is not
 
04:33:58.990 --> 04:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
prompt pay as this legislation
 
04:34:01.349 --> 04:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
contemplates but something more complex
 
04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
and deep we are going to share with you
 
04:34:06.429 --> 04:34:06.439 align:start position:0%
what we believe those issues are based
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
on our observations and Analysis however
 
04:34:14.230 --> 04:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
fundamentally there are two major issues
 
04:34:18.470 --> 04:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
the first is that the billing system is
 
04:34:18.480 --> 04:34:20.390 align:start position:0%
the first is that the billing system is
mind-numbingly

04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
mind-numbingly
 
04:34:23.470 --> 04:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
complicated and the second issue is that
 
04:34:23.480 --> 04:34:24.551 align:start position:0%
complicated and the second issue is that
human

04:34:24.551 --> 04:34:24.561 align:start position:0%
human
 
04:34:27.349 --> 04:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
beings all of which of us are of course
 
04:34:30.310 --> 04:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
fallible are trying to navigate that
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
incredibly complex
 
04:34:35.070 --> 04:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
system this is not to say that those who
 
04:34:37.869 --> 04:34:37.879 align:start position:0%
are responsible for billing on both the
 
04:34:40.269 --> 04:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
part of the carrier or the provider is
 
04:34:43.750 --> 04:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
not working hard or they're not smart or
 
04:34:46.510 --> 04:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
they're not doing their best what I am
 
04:34:48.310 --> 04:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
trying to get across to you is that this
 
04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
is a system that is going to have its
 
04:34:54.310 --> 04:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
flaws and despite best efforts mistakes
 
04:34:55.949 --> 04:34:55.959 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
04:34:58.390 --> 04:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
made therefore to help you understand
 
04:35:00.990 --> 04:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
the complexity and provide context to
 
04:35:02.510 --> 04:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
what carriers and hospitals are
 
04:35:05.349 --> 04:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
struggling with my team is going to walk
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
through a presentation that seeks to
 
04:35:09.470 --> 04:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
accomplish a few things walk you through
 
04:35:11.189 --> 04:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
and help you understand the claims
 
04:35:14.109 --> 04:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
handling and processing process they
 
04:35:16.910 --> 04:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
will then detail to you the legal prompt
 
04:35:19.750 --> 04:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
payment standards in current law and
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
then we will share with you where things
 
04:35:24.590 --> 04:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
can go wrong in that system and the role
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
that the insurance department can play
 
04:35:28.910 --> 04:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
in helping to resolve those
 
04:35:31.310 --> 04:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
issues I think it's really important
 
04:35:33.150 --> 04:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
that at no time and I appreciate the
 
04:35:34.590 --> 04:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
fact that this has been a long-going
 
04:35:34.600 --> 04:35:35.709 align:start position:0%
fact that this has been a long-going
discussion

04:35:35.709 --> 04:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:35:38.750 --> 04:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
in the state it is not helpful to try to
 
04:35:40.670 --> 04:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
view this situation through the Paradigm
 
04:35:43.590 --> 04:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
of good guys and bad guys I think what
 
04:35:46.551 --> 04:35:46.561 align:start position:0%
we need to focus our full attention on
 
04:35:49.551 --> 04:35:49.561 align:start position:0%
is how to resolve these as I said and
 
04:35:53.551 --> 04:35:53.561 align:start position:0%
we'll repeat again incredibly complex
 
04:35:56.429 --> 04:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
issues what is Mission critical is
 
04:35:58.869 --> 04:35:58.879 align:start position:0%
getting all to focus their entire
 
04:36:01.949 --> 04:36:01.959 align:start position:0%
attention on fixing the issues and so to
 
04:36:04.349 --> 04:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
help you better understand how we can do
 
04:36:06.510 --> 04:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
that I will turn the presentation over
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.269 --> 04:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
Michelle hello again my name is Michelle
 
04:36:16.629 --> 04:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
heat and I'm the health law and policy
 
04:36:19.109 --> 04:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
legal councel and um we don't have the
 
04:36:21.390 --> 04:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint set up but we'll flip through
 
04:36:23.189 --> 04:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
the pages together so I'll try to tell
 
04:36:27.189 --> 04:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
you exactly where I am in it so um as DJ
 
04:36:29.150 --> 04:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
said we want to just go over the life
 
04:36:31.349 --> 04:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
cycle of a claim what goes into filing
 
04:36:33.750 --> 04:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
it and the complexities of that not just
 
04:36:35.470 --> 04:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
in filing it but in processing ing it
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
and then going through um an overview
 
04:36:39.990 --> 04:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
what the New Hampshire insurance
 
04:36:42.869 --> 04:36:42.879 align:start position:0%
department does so if you turn to slide
 
04:36:44.629 --> 04:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
number two the
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
background again the purpose of this
 
04:36:48.189 --> 04:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
presentation is to explain the
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
requirements of New Hampshire's prop pay
 
04:36:52.230 --> 04:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
law and the complexities of the health
 
04:36:55.390 --> 04:36:55.400 align:start position:0%

04:36:58.390 --> 04:36:58.400 align:start position:0%

chip
 
04:37:11.869 --> 04:37:11.879 align:start position:0%
orare so that's very important to keep
 
04:37:14.629 --> 04:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
in mind and this is really being um
 
04:37:16.510 --> 04:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
provided as an overview for
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
informational purposes it's not going to
 
04:37:21.230 --> 04:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
address every um hiccup that can happen
 
04:37:23.670 --> 04:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
in the processing of a
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
claim so if you turn to the next slide
 
04:37:28.349 --> 04:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
number three the life cycle of a clean
 
04:37:30.709 --> 04:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
claim this is a little bit of a visual
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
to show you exactly what goes into uh
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
processing a claim first you need to
 
04:37:37.551 --> 04:37:37.561 align:start position:0%
have a covered person who receives
 
04:37:40.510 --> 04:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
care that um from a provider usually
 
04:37:42.789 --> 04:37:42.799 align:start position:0%
that's in network that provider collects
 
04:37:45.990 --> 04:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
information has to fill out a claim form
 
04:37:47.590 --> 04:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
submit that claim form within a certain
 
04:37:49.709 --> 04:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
amount of time and then it gets to the
 
04:37:51.349 --> 04:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
health carrier and the health carrier
 
04:37:53.429 --> 04:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
process that claim in accordance with
 
04:37:55.429 --> 04:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
the benefits of the covered person's
 
04:37:58.470 --> 04:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
plan and uh for electronic claims this
 
04:38:00.750 --> 04:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be done within 15 days
 
04:38:03.150 --> 04:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
for paper claims they have 30 days to
 
04:38:05.510 --> 04:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
complete this process
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
we turn to the next slide number four
 
04:38:09.390 --> 04:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
billing for
 
04:38:12.670 --> 04:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
care so before we can even process a
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
claim or submit a claim there has to be
 
04:38:17.830 --> 04:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
care that's provided to a covered person
 
04:38:19.551 --> 04:38:19.561 align:start position:0%
um in accordance with that person's
 
04:38:21.750 --> 04:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
insurance policy for covered benefits
 
04:38:23.310 --> 04:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
this will typically require them to go
 
04:38:25.750 --> 04:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
to an in network or preferred provider
 
04:38:28.230 --> 04:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
and receive medically necessary care
 
04:38:30.029 --> 04:38:30.039 align:start position:0%
sometimes that will also require prior
 
04:38:31.789 --> 04:38:31.799 align:start position:0%
authorization or they may need a
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
referral from their primary care
 
04:38:34.910 --> 04:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
provider before they can even rece
 
04:38:37.750 --> 04:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
receive the care the provider also needs
 
04:38:39.750 --> 04:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
to collect the covered person's most
 
04:38:42.390 --> 04:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
up-to-date insurance information people
 
04:38:44.310 --> 04:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
um will frequently change insurance
 
04:38:47.109 --> 04:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
carriers lose coverage gain coverage and
 
04:38:49.189 --> 04:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
if there's no coverage on the day of the
 
04:38:50.949 --> 04:38:50.959 align:start position:0%
services then there can be no payment
 
04:38:52.590 --> 04:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
for those services so it's very
 
04:38:53.789 --> 04:38:53.799 align:start position:0%
important to have the most up-to-date
 
04:38:55.949 --> 04:38:55.959 align:start position:0%
insurance information and then claims
 
04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
need to be submitted within 90 days and
 
04:39:00.029 --> 04:39:00.039 align:start position:0%
include all necessary information that
 
04:39:01.949 --> 04:39:01.959 align:start position:0%
means proper billing codes relevant
 
04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
modifiers proper diagnosis codes and
 
04:39:06.869 --> 04:39:06.879 align:start position:0%
correct provider information including
 
04:39:09.429 --> 04:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
the provider's address and NPI number so
 
04:39:11.070 --> 04:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
if you turn to the next slide number
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
five this is a copy of a paper claim
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
form that's it's a standardized form so
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
it's the same every time you submit it
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
and it has a lot of basic information
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
the top part is um what you can't hardly
 
04:39:26.189 --> 04:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
see uh because it's a little tiny is the
 
04:39:28.429 --> 04:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
patient information and then the bottom
 
04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
half is where you would put in um the
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
treatment codes diagnosis codes and mod
 
04:39:36.150 --> 04:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
modify iers if they apply and all that
 
04:39:37.830 --> 04:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
information and it seems like it should
 
04:39:40.070 --> 04:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
be a very straightforward process but
 
04:39:42.788 --> 04:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
just to give you some visuals uh these
 
04:39:47.430 --> 04:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
two manuals are for hcps and CPT codes
 
04:39:49.910 --> 04:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
these are full of codes that could
 
04:39:52.150 --> 04:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
possibly be built so there's a Code
 
04:39:54.030 --> 04:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
almost for everything and um like we
 
04:39:55.230 --> 04:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
were talking about earlier we're always
 
04:39:56.990 --> 04:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
coming up with new codes for new
 
04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
services and this is the ICD manual this
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
this is specific to diagnoses and the
 
04:40:04.590 --> 04:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
diagnoses have to line up properly with
 
04:40:07.070 --> 04:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
the services in the CPT codes and the
 
04:40:09.868 --> 04:40:09.878 align:start position:0%
hipi codes so it gets very complex and
 
04:40:10.990 --> 04:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
you really need to know what you're
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
doing in order to fill out these forms
 
04:40:15.948 --> 04:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
if um the right code is not used with
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
the right diagnosis code it's not going
 
04:40:20.628 --> 04:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
to be covered so that's part of the pro
 
04:40:22.430 --> 04:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
um I W say problem but that's part of
 
04:40:24.030 --> 04:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
the process is making sure you're using
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
the codes properly they also need to be
 
04:40:28.830 --> 04:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
used in accordance with the contract so
 
04:40:30.510 --> 04:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
the provider we're talking about in
 
04:40:32.110 --> 04:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
network providers here has a contract
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
with the carrier and there's certain
 
04:40:35.470 --> 04:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
ways that they need to build things
 
04:40:36.990 --> 04:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes there needs to be modifiers
 
04:40:38.510 --> 04:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes that are bundled services or
 
04:40:40.590 --> 04:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
unbundled so they have to be build in
 
04:40:43.670 --> 04:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
accordance with the contract as well so
 
04:40:48.270 --> 04:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:51.030 --> 04:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
carrier sure we have a question here
 
04:40:51.040 --> 04:40:53.150 align:start position:0%
carrier sure we have a question here
yeah

04:40:53.150 --> 04:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:40:57.830 --> 04:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
and so the person filling out um the
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
claim form is she or he a uh coder a
 
04:41:05.310 --> 04:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
medical uh what do they call them
 
04:41:07.070 --> 04:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
it would depend on the practice but yeah
 
04:41:10.430 --> 04:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of um medical billers who
 
04:41:12.150 --> 04:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
specialize in how to use these codes
 
04:41:13.868 --> 04:41:13.878 align:start position:0%
appropriately depending on the practice
 
04:41:15.910 --> 04:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
size it could be you know someone that's
 
04:41:17.628 --> 04:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
working in the front office of a smaller
 
04:41:20.110 --> 04:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
practice yeah and if it's a hospital you
 
04:41:22.590 --> 04:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
probably have um more sophisticated and
 
04:41:24.750 --> 04:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
again it the number of codes depends on
 
04:41:27.390 --> 04:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
the type of practice if you're um a
 
04:41:29.390 --> 04:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
mental health provider for example
 
04:41:30.670 --> 04:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
you're only probably dealing with a
 
04:41:32.628 --> 04:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
handful of codes whereas if you're a
 
04:41:35.150 --> 04:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
hospital you're dealing with a wide
 
04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
variety of codes and possible
 
04:41:40.830 --> 04:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
diagnoses so if the code is not uh a
 
04:41:43.628 --> 04:41:43.638 align:start position:0%
proper code then that's when things go
 
04:41:45.750 --> 04:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
arai and yes and we're gonna get to that
 
04:41:48.868 --> 04:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
next thanks so that's all everything
 
04:41:50.590 --> 04:41:50.600 align:start position:0%
that goes into just being able to submit
 
04:41:51.948 --> 04:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
the code so what we're going to talk
 
04:41:54.788 --> 04:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
about next is um I'm on slide six here
 
04:41:56.590 --> 04:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
the prompt pay law and what exactly is
 
04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
included in it claims denials claim
 
04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
denials and adverse determinations the
 
04:42:03.470 --> 04:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
appeals process and external review so
 
04:42:07.470 --> 04:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
turning now to to um slide seven prompt
 
04:42:09.510 --> 04:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
pay law which is RSA
 
04:42:13.110 --> 04:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
420j 8- a and this is our prompt play
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
law that um sets out certain time
 
04:42:17.430 --> 04:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
periods what's important to note about
 
04:42:19.150 --> 04:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
prompt pay law is that it doesn't
 
04:42:21.430 --> 04:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily guarantee payment what it's
 
04:42:22.910 --> 04:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
really talking about is that the claim
 
04:42:25.390 --> 04:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
is going to be processed within 15 days
 
04:42:28.030 --> 04:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
if it's electronic or 30 days if it's um
 
04:42:29.070 --> 04:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
a paper
 
04:42:32.470 --> 04:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
claim and in order for it to be
 
04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
processed it has to be a clean claim
 
04:42:36.590 --> 04:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
claim so a clean claim definition is
 
04:42:38.948 --> 04:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
there in paragraph 2 um and we're
 
04:42:40.910 --> 04:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
talking about it includes all the most
 
04:42:42.628 --> 04:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
current procedural codes all the
 
04:42:44.270 --> 04:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
required Fields they're filled out
 
04:42:45.868 --> 04:42:45.878 align:start position:0%
correctly and completely so that the
 
04:42:49.030 --> 04:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
carrier can easily process the claim now
 
04:42:51.270 --> 04:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
if it is a clean claim everything's
 
04:42:52.550 --> 04:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
filled out but there's additional
 
04:42:54.430 --> 04:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
information that's needed then the
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
carrier can request that additional
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
information the clock stops and once
 
04:43:00.670 --> 04:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
they receive that additional information
 
04:43:02.190 --> 04:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
the carryer now has 45 days to
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
adjudicate the
 
04:43:03.480 --> 04:43:05.628 align:start position:0%
adjudicate the
claim

04:43:05.628 --> 04:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
claim
 
04:43:08.110 --> 04:43:08.120 align:start position:0%
so moving on to our next slide number
 
04:43:10.830 --> 04:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
eight also included in our prompt pay
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
law is um an enforcement provision and
 
04:43:15.628 --> 04:43:15.638 align:start position:0%
this is specific to prompt pay and it's
 
04:43:17.110 --> 04:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit different than our general
 
04:43:19.110 --> 04:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement Provisions but it's
 
04:43:21.070 --> 04:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
important to highlight it because the
 
04:43:23.550 --> 04:43:23.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement for prompt pay comes into
 
04:43:26.110 --> 04:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
play when the commissioner has
 
04:43:28.510 --> 04:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
determined or established a pattern of
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
overdue payments now the statute doesn't
 
04:43:33.910 --> 04:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
Define a pattern of overdue payments but
 
04:43:36.510 --> 04:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
um we follow the market
 
04:43:39.390 --> 04:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
conduct regulation handbook which is
 
04:43:41.990 --> 04:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
this pile here that's um put out by the
 
04:43:44.788 --> 04:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
neicc and it sets standards for how to
 
04:43:47.030 --> 04:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
do Market conduct examinations and
 
04:43:49.750 --> 04:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
Analysis um and it's fairly uniform
 
04:43:51.430 --> 04:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
across the country but each state has
 
04:43:53.550 --> 04:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
its own specific laws that may um
 
04:43:55.510 --> 04:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
require some tweaking but generally
 
04:43:56.948 --> 04:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
according to the market regulation
 
04:43:59.510 --> 04:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
handbook a 7% error rate is an
 
04:44:01.670 --> 04:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
established Bank Benchmark for claim
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
practices that means if in the midst of
 
04:44:06.350 --> 04:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
a examination we find that there's an
 
04:44:09.150 --> 04:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
error rate of greater than 7% then it's
 
04:44:11.390 --> 04:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
presumed that the claims are not being
 
04:44:14.270 --> 04:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
handled in accordance with law if it's
 
04:44:16.590 --> 04:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
less than 7% then it's presumed that
 
04:44:19.070 --> 04:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
there's substantial compliance so that's
 
04:44:20.830 --> 04:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
important to keep in mind we're not
 
04:44:22.590 --> 04:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
expecting and it would be somewhat
 
04:44:25.110 --> 04:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
unrealistic to expect that 100% of
 
04:44:27.948 --> 04:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
claims are handled um correctly all the
 
04:44:31.110 --> 04:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
time that would be the perfect utopian
 
04:44:35.070 --> 04:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
world so moving on to um slide 9 which
 
04:44:38.150 --> 04:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
is our mcast data mcast is Market
 
04:44:39.910 --> 04:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
conduct annual statement that's what it
 
04:44:42.150 --> 04:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
stands for and this is data that's
 
04:44:44.390 --> 04:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
collected by the neic on a national
 
04:44:46.750 --> 04:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
level but all state um all our state
 
04:44:49.430 --> 04:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
carriers participate in it and it's a
 
04:44:51.230 --> 04:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
it's a large data call of all different
 
04:44:52.750 --> 04:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of information this is just a
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of a snapshot of some of the
 
04:44:56.590 --> 04:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
information that we got out of it and we
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
use this as part of our market analysis
 
04:44:59.670 --> 04:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
that we'll get to a little bit later but
 
04:45:01.510 --> 04:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
it gives a snapshot of how New Hampshire
 
04:45:04.390 --> 04:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
compares to the rest of the country so
 
04:45:06.550 --> 04:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
according to this data
 
04:45:09.628 --> 04:45:09.638 align:start position:0%
um out of all the claims being filed
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
excluding Pharmacy we have a denial rate
 
04:45:12.080 --> 04:45:13.590 align:start position:0%
excluding Pharmacy we have a denial rate
of

04:45:13.590 --> 04:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:45:16.670 --> 04:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
14.7% Which is less than the national
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
average if we're looking at um claims
 
04:45:21.708 --> 04:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
for submitted by in network providers
 
04:45:22.990 --> 04:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
again excluding
 
04:45:23.000 --> 04:45:24.948 align:start position:0%
again excluding
Pharmacy

04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy
 
04:45:24.958 --> 04:45:26.708 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy
96.25%

04:45:26.708 --> 04:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
96.25%
 
04:45:30.910 --> 04:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
are for in network providers and 3.75%
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
are for out of network providers and
 
04:45:34.708 --> 04:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
that's important because because if
 
04:45:36.270 --> 04:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
you're an in network provider you
 
04:45:38.150 --> 04:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
already have a contract established with
 
04:45:41.430 --> 04:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
the carrier and it's a lot easier to um
 
04:45:43.390 --> 04:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
have your claims processed if you're out
 
04:45:45.230 --> 04:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
of network there's a lot more variables
 
04:45:48.070 --> 04:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
at play so that can lead to delays in um
 
04:45:49.628 --> 04:45:49.638 align:start position:0%
processing the
 
04:45:52.990 --> 04:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
claims so of all the in network claims
 
04:45:54.030 --> 04:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
that were
 
04:45:57.510 --> 04:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:00.590 --> 04:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
96.9% are paid within 30 days now this
 
04:46:02.430 --> 04:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
does not translate to prompt pay because
 
04:46:03.628 --> 04:46:03.638 align:start position:0%
our time periods are a little bit
 
04:46:06.150 --> 04:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
different 30 days is more of a national
 
04:46:08.510 --> 04:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
Benchmark but it does tell us that a
 
04:46:10.990 --> 04:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
very large number are being paid within
 
04:46:11.000 --> 04:46:12.110 align:start position:0%
very large number are being paid within
that

04:46:12.110 --> 04:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:46:16.990 --> 04:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
96 uh of the ones being paid 96.9% are
 
04:46:18.868 --> 04:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
being paid within 30 days so that's a
 
04:46:20.350 --> 04:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
fairly quick
 
04:46:23.830 --> 04:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
turnaround then of the CL in in network
 
04:46:25.628 --> 04:46:25.638 align:start position:0%
claims that are
 
04:46:28.510 --> 04:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
denied those are being processed um at a
 
04:46:29.750 --> 04:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
rate of
 
04:46:32.990 --> 04:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
91.7% within 30 days so those two
 
04:46:34.750 --> 04:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
numbers give us a snapshot to show that
 
04:46:37.270 --> 04:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
the claims are being adjudicated fairly
 
04:46:39.230 --> 04:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
quickly and most of them are being
 
04:46:41.150 --> 04:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
adjudicated for in networ claims
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
excluding Pharmacy within that 30
 
04:46:47.510 --> 04:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
days so if you turn to the next slide
 
04:46:47.520 --> 04:46:49.310 align:start position:0%
days so if you turn to the next slide
number

04:46:49.310 --> 04:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:46:51.310 --> 04:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
10 we're going to start talking about
 
04:46:53.510 --> 04:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
claim denials a little so to just give
 
04:46:55.190 --> 04:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
you some context in the commercial
 
04:46:58.750 --> 04:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
market for calendar year 2022 there were
 
04:47:01.670 --> 04:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
approximately 16.3 million claims
 
04:47:04.430 --> 04:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
submitted so it's a very large number
 
04:47:07.310 --> 04:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
according to our M our our chis data
 
04:47:10.070 --> 04:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's an uh denial rate of about
 
04:47:12.628 --> 04:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
10.3% and I wouldn't compare this to the
 
04:47:14.590 --> 04:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
mcast data because we're kind of talking
 
04:47:16.430 --> 04:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
about different things here but they're
 
04:47:19.708 --> 04:47:19.718 align:start position:0%
somewhat in line so on this slide here
 
04:47:22.708 --> 04:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
um on 10 there's a list according to our
 
04:47:26.150 --> 04:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
chis data as some of the top reasons why
 
04:47:28.948 --> 04:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
claims are denied so we have um an exact
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
duplicate claim information was
 
04:47:32.868 --> 04:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
requested and not provided or is
 
04:47:34.590 --> 04:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
incomplete and you can see see the list
 
04:47:36.150 --> 04:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
and the percentage of claims that are
 
04:47:39.190 --> 04:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
denied based on that reason I also want
 
04:47:40.270 --> 04:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
to draw your attention to the very
 
04:47:42.750 --> 04:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
bottom where we say medical necessity
 
04:47:44.310 --> 04:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
this is not one of the top claims but
 
04:47:45.590 --> 04:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's worth putting on there because
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's one of the um reasons you're
 
04:47:49.830 --> 04:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
going to hear more often and according
 
04:47:52.430 --> 04:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
to our's De it's only
 
04:47:54.788 --> 04:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
0.65% of claims are being denied for
 
04:47:57.270 --> 04:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
that medical necessity reason so when
 
04:47:59.150 --> 04:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
the claim is denied for a lot of these
 
04:48:01.788 --> 04:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
reasons um it's just a matter of
 
04:48:03.270 --> 04:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
correcting the information on the claim
 
04:48:04.948 --> 04:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
maybe submitting more information and
 
04:48:06.750 --> 04:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
then the claim can be resubmitted and
 
04:48:08.910 --> 04:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
processed assuming that they now have
 
04:48:10.230 --> 04:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
all the correct
 
04:48:13.070 --> 04:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
information um if it can't be
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
reprocessed because it's something like
 
04:48:16.910 --> 04:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
medical necessity that's where we get
 
04:48:20.430 --> 04:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
into uh the appeals and external review
 
04:48:22.190 --> 04:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
process so if you turn to the next slide
 
04:48:26.070 --> 04:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
on uh number 11 medical necessity EXC y
 
04:48:27.548 --> 04:48:27.558 align:start position:0%
go ahead could I just interrupt you at
 
04:48:29.990 --> 04:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
this point thank you this is all very um
 
04:48:32.030 --> 04:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
helpful uh could you just tell us a
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
little bit about about more about what
 
04:48:38.110 --> 04:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
the definition of medical necessity is
 
04:48:41.830 --> 04:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
and who decides on what basis it is it
 
04:48:43.948 --> 04:48:43.958 align:start position:0%
is going to tell us yes it is what what
 
04:48:47.350 --> 04:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
a medical necessity is okay yep so we
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
got to Define it
 
04:48:54.390 --> 04:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
great so in 420 j3 are our definitions
 
04:48:58.750 --> 04:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
that are managed care and um XXV DB is
 
04:49:00.750 --> 04:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
medical necessity and it means the
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
healthc care services or products
 
04:49:04.750 --> 04:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
provided to an enrol Le for the purposes
 
04:49:07.150 --> 04:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
of preventing stabilizing diagnosing or
 
04:49:09.910 --> 04:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
treating an illness injury or disease or
 
04:49:11.590 --> 04:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
the symptoms of an illness injury or
 
04:49:13.868 --> 04:49:13.878 align:start position:0%
disease in a matter that is consistent
 
04:49:15.670 --> 04:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
with generally accepted standards of
 
04:49:17.470 --> 04:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
medical practice is clinically
 
04:49:19.548 --> 04:49:19.558 align:start position:0%
appropriate in terms of type frequency
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
extent sight and duration and
 
04:49:23.670 --> 04:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrate through scientific evidence
 
04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
to be effective in improving Health
 
04:49:28.310 --> 04:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
outcomes representative of best practice
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
in the medical profes and not primarily
 
04:49:32.670 --> 04:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
for the convenience of the enrol or
 
04:49:34.150 --> 04:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
physician or other healthare care
 
04:49:36.628 --> 04:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
provider so that is the definition that
 
04:49:39.110 --> 04:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
we apply throughout all of our
 
04:49:40.990 --> 04:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
regulations this is the definition of
 
04:49:43.830 --> 04:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
medical necessity so now so now I do
 
04:49:44.788 --> 04:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:49:46.830 --> 04:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
question this is what I get for not
 
04:49:48.548 --> 04:49:48.558 align:start position:0%
looking ahead that's
 
04:49:50.750 --> 04:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
why now I always used to it used to bug
 
04:49:52.190 --> 04:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
me that people would read five pages
 
04:49:54.670 --> 04:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
ahead and you it couldn't stay with the
 
04:49:58.548 --> 04:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
presentation okay uh so who decides what
 
04:50:01.070 --> 04:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
constitutes generally accepted standards
 
04:50:03.470 --> 04:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
of Medical Practice who who defines what
 
04:50:06.270 --> 04:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
is generally accepted it seems like you
 
04:50:09.310 --> 04:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
drive a truck through that yes so
 
04:50:11.788 --> 04:50:11.798 align:start position:0%
there's generally speaking the way the
 
04:50:13.628 --> 04:50:13.638 align:start position:0%
system is set up the carrier comes up
 
04:50:15.830 --> 04:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
with medical guidelines for the
 
04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
treatment of whatever we're talking
 
04:50:20.628 --> 04:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
about that needs to be based on
 
04:50:22.430 --> 04:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence so peer reviewed
 
04:50:24.470 --> 04:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
articles research you know what's
 
04:50:27.230 --> 04:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
happening in that field so that would be
 
04:50:30.430 --> 04:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
put into the clinical guidelines now if
 
04:50:32.190 --> 04:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
there is a dispute down the line which
 
04:50:34.510 --> 04:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
is where we're going to go next as to
 
04:50:35.948 --> 04:50:35.958 align:start position:0%
you know is that the most up-to-date
 
04:50:37.350 --> 04:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
literature should you be considering
 
04:50:39.270 --> 04:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
something else what about this study
 
04:50:40.430 --> 04:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
then you can go through the appeals and
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
external review process and we'll get to
 
04:50:42.000 --> 04:50:43.030 align:start position:0%
external review process and we'll get to
that

04:50:43.030 --> 04:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:45.470 --> 04:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
next so generally speaking a plan is
 
04:50:47.548 --> 04:50:47.558 align:start position:0%
only going to re reimburse items and
 
04:50:49.230 --> 04:50:49.240 align:start position:0%
services that are medically necessary
 
04:50:50.910 --> 04:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much the Cornerstone
 
04:50:53.948 --> 04:50:53.958 align:start position:0%
of Managed Care um is that you're only
 
04:50:55.470 --> 04:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
and insurance is that you're only going
 
04:50:57.150 --> 04:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
to get reimbursed for things that are
 
04:50:59.310 --> 04:50:59.320 align:start position:0%
medically necessary and also a covered
 
04:51:01.990 --> 04:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
benefit so those are and I would just
 
04:51:04.230 --> 04:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
say over the years we have Revis visited
 
04:51:04.240 --> 04:51:09.270 align:start position:0%
say over the years we have Revis visited
the

04:51:09.270 --> 04:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:11.670 --> 04:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
statute yeah so when you get when you
 
04:51:13.070 --> 04:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
get a claim
 
04:51:16.270 --> 04:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
denied as medically
 
04:51:18.470 --> 04:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
unnecessary somebody's somebody's
 
04:51:20.430 --> 04:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
pushing the envelope here but they
 
04:51:23.548 --> 04:51:23.558 align:start position:0%
already know that it's it's medically
 
04:51:25.150 --> 04:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
unnecessary do you understand what I
 
04:51:27.150 --> 04:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
mean by pushing the envelope it really
 
04:51:29.390 --> 04:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
depends on the um the circumstances
 
04:51:30.548 --> 04:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
would it be included in the
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances as one
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
example it could be that you know yeah
 
04:51:40.670 --> 04:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
generally experimental stuff is excluded
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
because it's not accepted that that is
 
04:51:46.030 --> 04:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
going to address the issue so that's a
 
04:51:48.350 --> 04:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
little bit different but yeah if you're
 
04:51:50.030 --> 04:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
talking about an in network provider
 
04:51:52.430 --> 04:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
they should be up to speed on what is
 
04:51:53.910 --> 04:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
medically necessary or not if there's a
 
04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
disagreement on that that's where we go
 
04:51:57.270 --> 04:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
through the appeals and external review
 
04:51:58.670 --> 04:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
process so what I'm trying to get at
 
04:52:01.470 --> 04:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
here Mr chairman is if it is if if it's
 
04:52:04.470 --> 04:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
known what's medically acceptable
 
04:52:06.788 --> 04:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
then why would somebody put in a claim
 
04:52:08.548 --> 04:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
for something that's medically
 
04:52:11.788 --> 04:52:11.798 align:start position:0%
unnecessary unless they're attempting to
 
04:52:14.510 --> 04:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
shake you know rattle the cage yeah but
 
04:52:16.868 --> 04:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
medically unnecessary was very low right
 
04:52:18.670 --> 04:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't that a low number well well it is
 
04:52:21.750 --> 04:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
but still no it's just it it very rarely
 
04:52:21.760 --> 04:52:23.590 align:start position:0%
but still no it's just it it very rarely
that

04:52:23.590 --> 04:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
happens well let me tell you what I
 
04:52:31.230 --> 04:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
know okay okay we each each health
 
04:52:34.230 --> 04:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
insurance entity has a medical
 
04:52:36.948 --> 04:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
director yep okay and the medical
 
04:52:40.310 --> 04:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
director's responsibility is to know
 
04:52:43.750 --> 04:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
what the uh standard standards of
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
practice the protocols that know know
 
04:52:48.910 --> 04:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
what is expected now one of the things
 
04:52:50.510 --> 04:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
we used to joke about in the committee
 
04:52:52.830 --> 04:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
is we used to call it the cookbook
 
04:52:54.430 --> 04:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
because he would say okay for the first
 
04:52:56.830 --> 04:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
time you do this and then if that didn't
 
04:52:58.830 --> 04:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
work then you do this and then you do
 
04:53:00.110 --> 04:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
this you keep turning the page you know
 
04:53:02.230 --> 04:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
in the cookbook but that at the end of
 
04:53:06.230 --> 04:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
the day everything thing is um is in
 
04:53:07.788 --> 04:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
terms of the standard of practice is
 
04:53:10.310 --> 04:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
what this is what everybody has agreed
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
is the pro appropriate step next
 
04:53:17.310 --> 04:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
step and but that can change and then if
 
04:53:19.830 --> 04:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
you take the example the DSM which is
 
04:53:21.470 --> 04:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
the mental health I mean that we're up
 
04:53:23.670 --> 04:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
to like 14 now and when I first got
 
04:53:26.830 --> 04:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
started we were like four right and so
 
04:53:28.548 --> 04:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
you know that so yes these things do
 
04:53:30.470 --> 04:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
change well well I understand that this
 
04:53:32.270 --> 04:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
is a dynamic
 
04:53:34.670 --> 04:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
process because because we don't have
 
04:53:36.430 --> 04:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
settled science on
 
04:53:39.150 --> 04:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
everything learning has become quite
 
04:53:40.830 --> 04:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
popular these days that's why we call it
 
04:53:42.910 --> 04:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
practicing medic not mastering it
 
04:53:46.270 --> 04:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
medically necessary is is this where
 
04:53:48.628 --> 04:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner vet Court's remarks with
 
04:53:50.430 --> 04:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
respect to people making
 
04:53:53.070 --> 04:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
mistakes why would you why would you put
 
04:53:56.910 --> 04:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
in a claim that you otherwise know is
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
not medically necessary and it therefore
 
04:54:01.548 --> 04:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
becomes part of the0
 
04:54:05.270 --> 04:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
65% so I mean again there is a whole
 
04:54:07.110 --> 04:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
spectrum of reasons why medical
 
04:54:09.270 --> 04:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
necessity can go Ary but one of them
 
04:54:11.230 --> 04:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
could be that you know to treat
 
04:54:11.240 --> 04:54:12.990 align:start position:0%
could be that you know to treat
condition

04:54:12.990 --> 04:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
condition
 
04:54:15.750 --> 04:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
a you know there are you know these
 
04:54:17.868 --> 04:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
different treatments available and the
 
04:54:18.990 --> 04:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
one that
 
04:54:22.708 --> 04:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
you did you know is the most appropriate
 
04:54:24.948 --> 04:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
if the patient exhibits with you know
 
04:54:26.948 --> 04:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
these three symptoms and it could be in
 
04:54:29.230 --> 04:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
this instance the treatment was provided
 
04:54:30.830 --> 04:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
but for this patient they only had two
 
04:54:32.990 --> 04:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
of those symptoms and not all three so
 
04:54:35.628 --> 04:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
maybe was isn't the best so it could be
 
04:54:36.590 --> 04:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
you know things like that there's
 
04:54:38.670 --> 04:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
different criteria that you know a
 
04:54:40.110 --> 04:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
patient would have to meet for a certain
 
04:54:41.910 --> 04:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
condition and it could be that you know
 
04:54:44.430 --> 04:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
the providers is not as up to speed on
 
04:54:46.868 --> 04:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
some of those things and the clinical
 
04:54:49.708 --> 04:54:49.718 align:start position:0%
guidelines can vary by carrier as well
 
04:54:52.788 --> 04:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
so so in the instance if you if I may so
 
04:54:54.470 --> 04:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
so so in the case that you've just cited
 
04:54:55.948 --> 04:54:55.958 align:start position:0%
the example you just cited this is an
 
04:54:58.510 --> 04:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
adverse consequence yes an adverse
 
04:54:59.788 --> 04:54:59.798 align:start position:0%
determination well it's an adverse
 
04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
consequence as well for the for the
 
04:55:06.070 --> 04:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
insured because the provider made a
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
mistake by not choosing the appropriate
 
04:55:09.600 --> 04:55:11.310 align:start position:0%
mistake by not choosing the appropriate
best

04:55:11.310 --> 04:55:11.320 align:start position:0%
best
 
04:55:15.030 --> 04:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
accepted uh course of care yes and in
 
04:55:17.150 --> 04:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
that instance typically the patient is
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
held harmless and the provider has to
 
04:55:21.548 --> 04:55:21.558 align:start position:0%
eat the cost of who decides that that's
 
04:55:25.788 --> 04:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
part of um in provider
 
04:55:28.910 --> 04:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
contracts thank you I could Co thank you
 
04:55:28.920 --> 04:55:30.270 align:start position:0%
contracts thank you I could Co thank you
thank

04:55:30.270 --> 04:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:55:32.590 --> 04:55:32.600 align:start position:0%
you answer some more questions next
 
04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation I
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
passed so if we move on to um 12 appeals
 
04:55:42.150 --> 04:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
so if you have an adverse determination
 
04:55:45.110 --> 04:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
and your claim is denied there is um
 
04:55:47.110 --> 04:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
carriers are required to have a
 
04:55:49.350 --> 04:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
grievance procedures that are appeals
 
04:55:52.470 --> 04:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
processes and if you look at 420 J5
 
04:55:54.270 --> 04:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
there's a list of things that it has to
 
04:55:56.190 --> 04:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
include including time frames who's
 
04:55:58.868 --> 04:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
going to be reviewing it
 
04:55:58.878 --> 04:56:00.430 align:start position:0%
going to be reviewing it
um

04:56:00.430 --> 04:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:03.430 --> 04:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the things is the claiming
 
04:56:05.030 --> 04:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
submit written comments documents
 
04:56:07.628 --> 04:56:07.638 align:start position:0%
records and other information um and all
 
04:56:10.708 --> 04:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
the information and documents submitted
 
04:56:13.390 --> 04:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
would be reviewed um by someone who's
 
04:56:14.750 --> 04:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
different than who made the idential
 
04:56:16.390 --> 04:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
denial so there's a lot of Protections
 
04:56:18.548 --> 04:56:18.558 align:start position:0%
in there if that still does not resolve
 
04:56:21.670 --> 04:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
the issue then if we turn to slide 13
 
04:56:24.070 --> 04:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
you can go to external review so the
 
04:56:25.948 --> 04:56:25.958 align:start position:0%
internal appeals process is handled at
 
04:56:27.230 --> 04:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
the carrier level and even though
 
04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
there's different people they all are
 
04:56:31.190 --> 04:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
within that carrier system external
 
04:56:33.070 --> 04:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
review is going to an independent third
 
04:56:35.310 --> 04:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
part party and the sides submit their
 
04:56:37.390 --> 04:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
both both of their arguments about why
 
04:56:39.390 --> 04:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
something is medically necessary or not
 
04:56:41.030 --> 04:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
and then this independent review
 
04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
organization makes that determination
 
04:56:47.190 --> 04:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
this is binding on the parties and um
 
04:56:48.948 --> 04:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of statutary requirements
 
04:56:50.628 --> 04:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
for how the system works as well so if
 
04:56:54.310 --> 04:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
you looked at 420 j5- a through 420
 
04:56:56.788 --> 04:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
j5- there's a lot of procedures time
 
04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
frames that need to be um complied with
 
04:57:03.350 --> 04:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
and if it's something that needs um an
 
04:57:05.350 --> 04:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
expedient decision there's like a
 
04:57:07.868 --> 04:57:07.878 align:start position:0%
72-hour time frame for um submitting
 
04:57:09.470 --> 04:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
these and getting a
 
04:57:12.590 --> 04:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
response um and our experience uh recent
 
04:57:14.510 --> 04:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
experience with this process is that
 
04:57:17.430 --> 04:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
about 40% of the time the carrier's
 
04:57:20.110 --> 04:57:20.120 align:start position:0%
decision gets overturned so it's a
 
04:57:20.120 --> 04:57:21.670 align:start position:0%
decision gets overturned so it's a
meaningful

04:57:21.670 --> 04:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
04:57:25.070 --> 04:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
process yeah and for calendar year 22
 
04:57:27.910 --> 04:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
there were 46 eligible claims submitted
 
04:57:29.948 --> 04:57:29.958 align:start position:0%
for external review and the department
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
handles that submission
 
04:57:32.200 --> 04:57:33.948 align:start position:0%
handles that submission
process

04:57:33.948 --> 04:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:57:36.590 --> 04:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
so if you turn to um the next slide
 
04:57:36.600 --> 04:57:37.510 align:start position:0%
so if you turn to um the next slide
number

04:57:37.510 --> 04:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:57:37.520 --> 04:57:39.310 align:start position:0%
number
14

04:57:39.310 --> 04:57:39.320 align:start position:0%
14
 
04:57:43.030 --> 04:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
um sometimes claims are adjudicated not
 
04:57:45.868 --> 04:57:45.878 align:start position:0%
as expected and this kind of falls out
 
04:57:48.110 --> 04:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
of the realm of prompt pay because the
 
04:57:50.430 --> 04:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
claim is processed so it's not a
 
04:57:52.590 --> 04:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
violation of prompt pay but the amount
 
04:57:54.670 --> 04:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
of payment the provider may get may not
 
04:57:56.830 --> 04:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
be what they were expecting and it could
 
04:57:58.390 --> 04:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
be that you know they're looking at the
 
04:58:00.788 --> 04:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
wrong fee schedule or miscalculated and
 
04:58:01.868 --> 04:58:01.878 align:start position:0%
thought they were supposed to get more
 
04:58:04.670 --> 04:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
money when in fact they're not
 
04:58:06.390 --> 04:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily entitled to it or it could
 
04:58:08.548 --> 04:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
be that the carrier is Prov
 
04:58:11.310 --> 04:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
um processing it using the wrong fee
 
04:58:13.390 --> 04:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
schedule and are supposed to be paying
 
04:58:16.310 --> 04:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
more money um it could be that there
 
04:58:19.390 --> 04:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
are con system configuration issues that
 
04:58:20.948 --> 04:58:20.958 align:start position:0%
lead to you know wrong fee schedule
 
04:58:23.030 --> 04:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
wrong amount of co- insurance or
 
04:58:24.628 --> 04:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
applying a co- insurance instead of
 
04:58:27.150 --> 04:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
co-payment there's a variety of reasons
 
04:58:28.670 --> 04:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
why things can go wrong and even though
 
04:58:30.190 --> 04:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
the claim is processed and there's no
 
04:58:32.270 --> 04:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
dispute this is a covered benefit there
 
04:58:34.430 --> 04:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
is some discrepancy see and the numbers
 
04:58:36.070 --> 04:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
and what is actually getting paid and
 
04:58:38.708 --> 04:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
what's not so there's a lot of issues
 
04:58:38.718 --> 04:58:39.590 align:start position:0%
what's not so there's a lot of issues
and

04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:42.750 --> 04:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
that unless you go in and do a claims
 
04:58:44.270 --> 04:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
examination you're looking at each one
 
04:58:47.070 --> 04:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
of these individual claims there's no
 
04:58:48.868 --> 04:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
easy way to figure out what exactly went
 
04:58:48.878 --> 04:58:50.110 align:start position:0%
easy way to figure out what exactly went
wrong

04:58:50.110 --> 04:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:58:52.788 --> 04:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
here so that kind of brings us to the
 
04:58:54.670 --> 04:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
role of the insurance department which
 
04:58:58.670 --> 04:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
is slide 15 Mr chairman question yes so
 
04:59:01.470 --> 04:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
are we still within 30 days here or we
 
04:59:04.110 --> 04:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
on a different clock when we move from
 
04:59:06.470 --> 04:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
page 12 to 13 to 14 here in the appeals
 
04:59:09.070 --> 04:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
process there are different timelines so
 
04:59:11.070 --> 04:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
right associated with appeals and
 
04:59:13.590 --> 04:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
Grievances and then again with external
 
04:59:15.150 --> 04:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
review so where are we now what what
 
04:59:16.948 --> 04:59:16.958 align:start position:0%
kind of a clock applies in the appeals
 
04:59:19.708 --> 04:59:19.718 align:start position:0%
process part of it depends on when the
 
04:59:22.030 --> 04:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
um covered person submits the appeal so
 
04:59:24.390 --> 04:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
I believe they have 180 days to submit
 
04:59:26.628 --> 04:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
the appeal and then um assuming you know
 
04:59:27.670 --> 04:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
they have all the right information I
 
04:59:29.270 --> 04:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
believe they have 30 days to adjudicate
 
04:59:31.510 --> 04:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
it but I might have to that but if it
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
was a clean claim so it it just and then
 
04:59:36.830 --> 04:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
by the time the check gets
 
04:59:39.030 --> 04:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
cut it's going to be that's going to be
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
close that's not more than you know the
 
04:59:44.350 --> 04:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
30 plus days and then it's because it's
 
04:59:47.910 --> 04:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
it was adjudicated but but now it's the
 
04:59:50.230 --> 04:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
payment is made and the doctor says oh
 
04:59:51.868 --> 04:59:51.878 align:start position:0%
this is not what I was
 
04:59:53.750 --> 04:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
expecting yes and that would that can
 
04:59:56.070 --> 04:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
happen in a very short period of time
 
04:59:58.590 --> 04:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
yes I'm still back on the clock if if
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
you don't mind so 30 days adverse
 
05:00:02.160 --> 05:00:04.230 align:start position:0%
you don't mind so 30 days adverse
decision

05:00:04.230 --> 05:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:00:08.910 --> 05:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
now uh the provider is
 
05:00:12.470 --> 05:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
notified now we have 180 days he he or
 
05:00:15.750 --> 05:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
she they have 180 days to to appeal if
 
05:00:17.948 --> 05:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
an appeal is filed any time within the
 
05:00:20.350 --> 05:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
180 days then there's a new clock that
 
05:00:23.430 --> 05:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
starts on the appeal and that's 30 days
 
05:00:25.430 --> 05:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
for a decision to be rendered I I
 
05:00:26.628 --> 05:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
believe somebody I'd have to double
 
05:00:28.910 --> 05:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
check that it's in the statute all this
 
05:00:30.270 --> 05:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
is very critical because one of the
 
05:00:31.510 --> 05:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
issues that we're hearing is that these
 
05:00:33.910 --> 05:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
things go on and on and on for forever
 
05:00:36.070 --> 05:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
and and it seems to me that there are
 
05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
definite time frames here yes and and we
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
might not be entirely happy with what
 
05:00:44.230 --> 05:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
they are but it's 30 180 30 yeah so if
 
05:00:45.670 --> 05:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
you could just keep that in mind as you
 
05:00:47.110 --> 05:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
go along I'd appreciate it because I'm
 
05:00:49.270 --> 05:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
trying to keep track of like worst case
 
05:00:52.030 --> 05:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
scenarios here where okay it went 30
 
05:00:54.310 --> 05:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
days I got notified well I the person
 
05:00:57.628 --> 05:00:57.638 align:start position:0%
filed 1879 Days Later well then it was
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
another 30 days okay thank you yes and a
 
05:01:02.390 --> 05:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
lot of time too if more information's
 
05:01:05.110 --> 05:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
needed those clocks stop so it often
 
05:01:07.708 --> 05:01:07.718 align:start position:0%
times becomes dependent on the person
 
05:01:10.470 --> 05:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
making filing these appeals filing the
 
05:01:12.830 --> 05:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
necessary information you know if
 
05:01:15.670 --> 05:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
they're filing it immediately this whole
 
05:01:17.470 --> 05:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
process is going to move much quicker
 
05:01:19.830 --> 05:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
but again if they're waiting to 179th
 
05:01:21.510 --> 05:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
day to do it then it's going to stretch
 
05:01:23.750 --> 05:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
out the process longer okay so in sports
 
05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
terms if we if we might this will be
 
05:01:28.470 --> 05:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
helpful to me basketball or or football
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
we can actually have a
 
05:01:29.920 --> 05:01:31.670 align:start position:0%
we can actually have a
timeout

05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
timeout
 
05:01:34.430 --> 05:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so while the carrier is waiting
 
05:01:36.110 --> 05:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
for them to submit more information once
 
05:01:37.708 --> 05:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
they say oh we can't do anything yet we
 
05:01:39.430 --> 05:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
need you to submit this information the
 
05:01:40.708 --> 05:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
clock stops until they get the
 
05:01:41.788 --> 05:01:41.798 align:start position:0%
additional information and then the
 
05:01:43.948 --> 05:01:43.958 align:start position:0%
clock restarts yes so now now it could
 
05:01:47.590 --> 05:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
be even longer than 180 days yes okay
 
05:01:51.628 --> 05:01:51.638 align:start position:0%
this is very helpful thank you okay okay
 
05:01:55.430 --> 05:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
so are we all set on those those issues
 
05:01:58.070 --> 05:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay so slide 15 the role of insurance
 
05:02:00.190 --> 05:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
department so the insurance department
 
05:02:02.270 --> 05:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
enforces the insurance laws to protect
 
05:02:04.750 --> 05:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
consumers and to ensure a stable market
 
05:02:06.110 --> 05:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
and we do that with our consumer
 
05:02:07.990 --> 05:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
services our market analysis
 
05:02:08.000 --> 05:02:09.390 align:start position:0%
services our market analysis
investigations

05:02:09.390 --> 05:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
05:02:11.670 --> 05:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
examinations what the department does
 
05:02:13.788 --> 05:02:13.798 align:start position:0%
not have the jurisdiction or authority
 
05:02:16.230 --> 05:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
to do is to resolve contractual disputes
 
05:02:18.270 --> 05:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
between insurers and any entity or
 
05:02:21.430 --> 05:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
individual that they contract with so
 
05:02:23.030 --> 05:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's important to keep in mind we're
 
05:02:24.750 --> 05:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
regulating the market we want to make
 
05:02:28.628 --> 05:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
sure things are um moving in accordance
 
05:02:31.628 --> 05:02:31.638 align:start position:0%
with law but part of this issue is
 
05:02:34.110 --> 05:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
contractual disputes between insurers
 
05:02:36.190 --> 05:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
and the entities they contract with and
 
05:02:38.990 --> 05:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have jurisdiction over that so
 
05:02:41.910 --> 05:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next slide number 16 um
 
05:02:43.510 --> 05:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about insurance
 
05:02:45.510 --> 05:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
regulation we like to talk about the
 
05:02:47.670 --> 05:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
Continuum of insurance regulation and
 
05:02:50.310 --> 05:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
that's what this is trying to um show
 
05:02:52.310 --> 05:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
you is that the Continuum gives
 
05:02:54.868 --> 05:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
Regulators the flexibility to use the
 
05:02:56.910 --> 05:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
most appropriate amount of Regulation
 
05:02:59.750 --> 05:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
necessary to address an issue it gives
 
05:03:02.830 --> 05:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
us um more flexibility to use our
 
05:03:05.310 --> 05:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
resources in the most efficient way
 
05:03:08.750 --> 05:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
possible to attain quick results so not
 
05:03:11.070 --> 05:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
every issue is going to lead to a market
 
05:03:13.310 --> 05:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
conduct examination because those are
 
05:03:15.708 --> 05:03:15.718 align:start position:0%
very lengthy timec consuming resource
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
intensive processes sometimes it's um a
 
05:03:21.990 --> 05:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
lot quicker and more effective for us to
 
05:03:23.628 --> 05:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
do light touch which would be on the
 
05:03:25.390 --> 05:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
contact end of the Spectrum which means
 
05:03:27.150 --> 05:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
picking up the phone making a phone call
 
05:03:29.310 --> 05:03:29.320 align:start position:0%
sending a letter something simple like
 
05:03:32.948 --> 05:03:32.958 align:start position:0%
that to resolve the issue and um so
 
05:03:34.350 --> 05:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
that's at one end of the spectrum and
 
05:03:36.390 --> 05:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
then it works up to investigations which
 
05:03:38.070 --> 05:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
can include documents requests
 
05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
interrogatories interviews attempting to
 
05:03:45.910 --> 05:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
um facilitate some type of uh dispute
 
05:03:48.788 --> 05:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
resolution U between the parties and
 
05:03:50.990 --> 05:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
then it goes towards examination
 
05:03:53.910 --> 05:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
examination is a very
 
05:03:57.150 --> 05:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
detailed extensive process that we'll
 
05:03:59.390 --> 05:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
get to later and then all of this can
 
05:04:02.030 --> 05:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
lead to enforcement and on the far right
 
05:04:06.070 --> 05:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
side of enforcement is the um most harsh
 
05:04:07.470 --> 05:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
thing we could do which would be to
 
05:04:09.270 --> 05:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
revoke a license and that would only be
 
05:04:11.150 --> 05:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
in the most extreme situations would we
 
05:04:12.270 --> 05:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
revoke a
 
05:04:15.708 --> 05:04:15.718 align:start position:0%
license so if you turn to slide number
 
05:04:19.788 --> 05:04:19.798 align:start position:0%
17 um our consumer services unit uh is
 
05:04:21.548 --> 05:04:21.558 align:start position:0%
one of the tools we use and they help
 
05:04:23.430 --> 05:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
educate consumers and residents about
 
05:04:27.430 --> 05:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
insurance products assist residents and
 
05:04:29.030 --> 05:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers navigating the
 
05:04:32.270 --> 05:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
complexity of the insurance industry and
 
05:04:32.280 --> 05:04:33.150 align:start position:0%
complexity of the insurance industry and
assist

05:04:33.150 --> 05:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
assist
 
05:04:35.270 --> 05:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
um other department staff in doing
 
05:04:38.548 --> 05:04:38.558 align:start position:0%
investigations so for calendar year 22
 
05:04:41.708 --> 05:04:41.718 align:start position:0%
the consumer services received 313
 
05:04:44.350 --> 05:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints relating to Health
 
05:04:47.948 --> 05:04:47.958 align:start position:0%
Products of those 73% related to some
 
05:04:52.150 --> 05:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
kind of claims issue and of that 73%
 
05:04:55.910 --> 05:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
only 20% of those complaints were
 
05:04:58.510 --> 05:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
confirmed as a regulatory
 
05:05:01.230 --> 05:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
violation we also um our consumer
 
05:05:03.708 --> 05:05:03.718 align:start position:0%
services also helped
 
05:05:06.788 --> 05:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers and we call their
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
um submissions inquiries as opposed to
 
05:05:11.910 --> 05:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
complaints which are by consumers and
 
05:05:14.830 --> 05:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
for calendar year 22 we received 115
 
05:05:17.868 --> 05:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider inquiries 81% of
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
those related to some kind of claims
 
05:05:22.750 --> 05:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
issue and 25% of those were confirmed as
 
05:05:25.270 --> 05:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
a regulatory violation um and then we
 
05:05:26.670 --> 05:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
have our consumer services contact
 
05:05:27.750 --> 05:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
information there if anyone wants to
 
05:05:29.868 --> 05:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
reach out about um their own specific
 
05:05:31.670 --> 05:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
complaint or have a constituent that you
 
05:05:34.110 --> 05:05:34.120 align:start position:0%
would like to direct her way so next
 
05:05:36.910 --> 05:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
slide number 18 we're on market
 
05:05:39.310 --> 05:05:39.320 align:start position:0%
analysis market analysis is another part
 
05:05:40.868 --> 05:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
of the Continuum of Regulation that
 
05:05:42.830 --> 05:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
consists of collecting and analyzing
 
05:05:44.868 --> 05:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
data and other information to assist
 
05:05:46.990 --> 05:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
Regulators in monitoring the market
 
05:05:49.510 --> 05:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
identifying problems early on and
 
05:05:51.948 --> 05:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
focusing resources in a way to better
 
05:05:54.390 --> 05:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
prioritize and coordinate various Market
 
05:05:54.400 --> 05:05:56.150 align:start position:0%
prioritize and coordinate various Market
conduct

05:05:56.150 --> 05:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
05:05:58.990 --> 05:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
functions so if you turn to the next
 
05:06:00.350 --> 05:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
slide number
 
05:06:04.470 --> 05:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
19 um next on the is investigations so
 
05:06:07.990 --> 05:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
our investigation statute is RSA 400
 
05:06:10.628 --> 05:06:10.638 align:start position:0%
a16 um this gives us very broad
 
05:06:12.590 --> 05:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
authority to investigate anything under
 
05:06:16.230 --> 05:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
title 37 which is relating to
 
05:06:20.868 --> 05:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
Insurance um for calendar year 22 our
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
Market conduct team had 45 open in
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
investigations relating to health
 
05:06:28.750 --> 05:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
insurance of those 73% related to some
 
05:06:31.270 --> 05:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
kind of claims handling issue
 
05:06:32.910 --> 05:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
investigations are comp confidential and
 
05:06:34.910 --> 05:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
we can't disclose any of the information
 
05:06:36.430 --> 05:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
obtained during an investigation and
 
05:06:40.190 --> 05:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's by Statute and um we can disclose
 
05:06:42.030 --> 05:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
when we do take a regulatory action so
 
05:06:43.510 --> 05:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
if you want to look at the Department's
 
05:06:45.230 --> 05:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
website under Legal Information if you
 
05:06:47.350 --> 05:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
scroll down towards the bottom there's a
 
05:06:50.670 --> 05:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
listing of all recent regulatory actions
 
05:06:53.190 --> 05:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
that we have taken or hearings that are
 
05:06:55.750 --> 05:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
currently scheduled to take place
 
05:07:00.270 --> 05:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
soon and finally we're on slide 20 um we
 
05:07:02.150 --> 05:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
have Market conduct examinations and
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
again and this is the market conduct
 
05:07:07.708 --> 05:07:07.718 align:start position:0%
regulation handbook it is a very
 
05:07:10.750 --> 05:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
thorough um compilation of how to do a
 
05:07:12.990 --> 05:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
market conduct examination we also have
 
05:07:14.430 --> 05:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
a statute
 
05:07:17.190 --> 05:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
4837 that details the process and that
 
05:07:18.868 --> 05:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
flowchart here kind of details the
 
05:07:21.070 --> 05:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
different stages of an examination
 
05:07:23.830 --> 05:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of due process built in to
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
make sure um carriers have an
 
05:07:29.868 --> 05:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um weigh in when there
 
05:07:32.948 --> 05:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
are findings um and it can lead to
 
05:07:35.390 --> 05:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
there's an examination report um
 
05:07:37.628 --> 05:07:37.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions down the line but it
 
05:07:40.030 --> 05:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
can be a very lengthy process because
 
05:07:43.270 --> 05:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's very detailed and very resource
 
05:07:45.270 --> 05:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
intensive and those are privilege and
 
05:07:47.510 --> 05:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
confidential until regulatory action is
 
05:07:50.030 --> 05:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
taken as well so while we may be in the
 
05:07:52.030 --> 05:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
midst of an Market conduct examination
 
05:07:54.030 --> 05:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
we are unable to disclose any of those
 
05:07:56.230 --> 05:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
details until there is a final
 
05:07:59.350 --> 05:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:02.910 --> 05:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
taken phenomenal job Michelle uh and
 
05:08:05.190 --> 05:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Alex as well uh just a few
 
05:08:07.510 --> 05:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
brief concluding thoughts before we take
 
05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
any questions that you still may have
 
05:08:11.470 --> 05:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
you know obviously I hope the
 
05:08:13.030 --> 05:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
presentation this afternoon has
 
05:08:14.868 --> 05:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
demonstrated the nature and complexity
 
05:08:18.310 --> 05:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
of the issue as I uh outlined at the
 
05:08:21.868 --> 05:08:21.878 align:start position:0%
outset and my belief that
 
05:08:24.190 --> 05:08:24.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think getting to the
 
05:08:26.030 --> 05:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
bottom of this situation is well beyond
 
05:08:27.510 --> 05:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
the scope of
 
05:08:30.150 --> 05:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
legislation and I know that that is
 
05:08:32.948 --> 05:08:32.958 align:start position:0%
perhaps disappointing I used to sit in
 
05:08:36.788 --> 05:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
your seats I completely understand the
 
05:08:39.750 --> 05:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
strong desire to be able to fix problems
 
05:08:40.948 --> 05:08:40.958 align:start position:0%
via piece of
 
05:08:43.350 --> 05:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
legislation unfortunately I think the
 
05:08:45.788 --> 05:08:45.798 align:start position:0%
the nature of this is outside of that
 
05:08:49.070 --> 05:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
scope so what is the answer at least in
 
05:08:50.190 --> 05:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
the short
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
term the answer is for the appropriate
 
05:08:55.270 --> 05:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
individuals and decision makers on both
 
05:08:57.390 --> 05:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
sides both the carrier side and the
 
05:08:59.788 --> 05:08:59.798 align:start position:0%
provider side to come together with the
 
05:09:02.470 --> 05:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
full complement of information in the
 
05:09:04.070 --> 05:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
claims file and work through those
 
05:09:05.948 --> 05:09:05.958 align:start position:0%
claims and my understanding is is that
 
05:09:09.548 --> 05:09:09.558 align:start position:0%
that process is currently well underway
 
05:09:11.470 --> 05:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
that said I appreciate the fact that
 
05:09:14.670 --> 05:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
that process is slow and our hospitals
 
05:09:18.510 --> 05:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
in particular I know are frustrated but
 
05:09:21.070 --> 05:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
as we sit here today at least uh that is
 
05:09:22.990 --> 05:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
the most effective way to resolve these
 
05:09:25.788 --> 05:09:25.798 align:start position:0%
issues and to get the providers
 
05:09:28.990 --> 05:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately uh paid my commitment to
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
you and our Department's commitment to
 
05:09:33.230 --> 05:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
you will be to do do everything that we
 
05:09:36.510 --> 05:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
can to facilitate those conversations to
 
05:09:39.310 --> 05:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
provide resources and expertise wherever
 
05:09:42.750 --> 05:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
and whenever we can and to hold the
 
05:09:44.948 --> 05:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers accountable those are
 
05:09:46.990 --> 05:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
the entities that we have regulatory
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
authority over that is part of our job
 
05:09:52.708 --> 05:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
but as it pertains to the long-standing
 
05:09:55.110 --> 05:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
dispute I have made a personal
 
05:09:57.470 --> 05:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
commitment to do everything that I can
 
05:09:59.788 --> 05:09:59.798 align:start position:0%
to resolve this issue this issue was
 
05:10:02.830 --> 05:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
featured prominently last month when my
 
05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
hearing to be insurance commissioner
 
05:10:08.070 --> 05:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
took place before the executive Council
 
05:10:09.708 --> 05:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
and so that is a commitment that I made
 
05:10:11.830 --> 05:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
to them it is a commitment that I will
 
05:10:15.270 --> 05:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
make uh to you as well you know I think
 
05:10:18.990 --> 05:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
again as you hear and see some of these
 
05:10:21.708 --> 05:10:21.718 align:start position:0%
reports about the current Dynamic I
 
05:10:23.750 --> 05:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
think that of the slides that we've
 
05:10:25.750 --> 05:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
provided you with and I think the
 
05:10:27.708 --> 05:10:27.718 align:start position:0%
material here is incredibly useful to
 
05:10:31.110 --> 05:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
you I think to understand what's going
 
05:10:32.708 --> 05:10:32.718 align:start position:0%
on here
 
05:10:35.190 --> 05:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
it's not prompay it is the issues that
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
are highlighted here on the slide that
 
05:10:41.310 --> 05:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
says claim adjudicated not as expected
 
05:10:43.390 --> 05:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
that is what we believe is at the core
 
05:10:44.270 --> 05:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:10:48.190 --> 05:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
dispute and so again we will work with
 
05:10:50.868 --> 05:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
both sides to figure out these issues if
 
05:10:52.830 --> 05:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
there are glitches in the system if
 
05:10:55.470 --> 05:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
there are systematic problems in the
 
05:10:58.110 --> 05:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
system we will do everything we can to
 
05:11:00.190 --> 05:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
work with the parties to identify those
 
05:11:03.430 --> 05:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
issues too I'll just conclude by saying
 
05:11:05.788 --> 05:11:05.798 align:start position:0%
that you know I've been asked and I know
 
05:11:08.548 --> 05:11:08.558 align:start position:0%
the previous commissioner was asked why
 
05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
not bring forward a market conduct exam
 
05:11:13.750 --> 05:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
to this issue from my perspective the
 
05:11:17.548 --> 05:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
answer is fairly simple my goal is to
 
05:11:21.190 --> 05:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
get the providers paid quickly I am told
 
05:11:22.628 --> 05:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
and they relay to me and I'm sure
 
05:11:24.788 --> 05:11:24.798 align:start position:0%
they've relay to you that some of them
 
05:11:27.270 --> 05:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
are struggling financially and that
 
05:11:30.430 --> 05:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
these holdups are impacting their
 
05:11:33.150 --> 05:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
operations I have absolutely no reason
 
05:11:34.948 --> 05:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
to not believe those claims are
 
05:11:38.470 --> 05:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely true so that being the case
 
05:11:40.150 --> 05:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
the commitment and I think the goal has
 
05:11:42.708 --> 05:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
to be to move as quickly as we can to
 
05:11:44.990 --> 05:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
resolve these issues and get them paid
 
05:11:46.548 --> 05:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
and as I said as grueling as that
 
05:11:49.030 --> 05:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
process is to sit down and make sure the
 
05:11:51.510 --> 05:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
claims are clean to make sure that
 
05:11:53.948 --> 05:11:53.958 align:start position:0%
you've got the interplay between the you
 
05:11:55.708 --> 05:11:55.718 align:start position:0%
know the the the allowed amount the
 
05:11:57.150 --> 05:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
charged amount and all of those
 
05:11:59.150 --> 05:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
different complexities that go into this
 
05:12:02.310 --> 05:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
thing you know It's a Grind I will admit
 
05:12:03.788 --> 05:12:03.798 align:start position:0%
but it is
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
faster than
 
05:12:09.590 --> 05:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
this so at least for
 
05:12:13.590 --> 05:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
now um my goal is to try to do not take
 
05:12:16.390 --> 05:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
the easy way out but to try to do the
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
thing that is going to be most quick
 
05:12:20.470 --> 05:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that we wouldn't do an
 
05:12:23.070 --> 05:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
exam it's a important tool that we have
 
05:12:24.670 --> 05:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
as Regulators I would never take
 
05:12:27.708 --> 05:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
important tools off the table for us uh
 
05:12:29.150 --> 05:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
so it's not to say that we wouldn't at
 
05:12:32.110 --> 05:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
some point uh I am a a patient man a
 
05:12:34.510 --> 05:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
fair man my kids might dispute that some
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
days but I try um I want to see
 
05:12:40.150 --> 05:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
continued progress and I want to see
 
05:12:43.430 --> 05:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
that we are on a trajectory to end this
 
05:12:45.868 --> 05:12:45.878 align:start position:0%
issue and that is going to be my focus
 
05:12:52.830 --> 05:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:54.990 --> 05:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
you any
 
05:12:58.948 --> 05:12:58.958 align:start position:0%
questions so how you when when clearly
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
there are some cases that just go are
 
05:13:02.628 --> 05:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
going on too long
 
05:13:05.590 --> 05:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
how do we create a system where where
 
05:13:08.470 --> 05:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
forces a conversation about how what's
 
05:13:11.030 --> 05:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
going on why I mean it's some is there
 
05:13:14.230 --> 05:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
must be some kind of Drop Dead dat you
 
05:13:17.030 --> 05:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
know something that say boy we need we
 
05:13:18.990 --> 05:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
need to get the parties in the room
 
05:13:21.990 --> 05:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
together and figure out why this case
 
05:13:23.910 --> 05:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
why this is not paid I mean I don't know
 
05:13:25.990 --> 05:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
if it's a dollar amount or a time frame
 
05:13:28.310 --> 05:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
amount or something but it seems to me
 
05:13:31.990 --> 05:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
that there that there has to be some
 
05:13:34.990 --> 05:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
some way to you know to when a case has
 
05:13:36.868 --> 05:13:36.878 align:start position:0%
just been hanging around way too long or
 
05:13:38.990 --> 05:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
just not been paid there's got to be
 
05:13:41.310 --> 05:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
some way we can you know say have the
 
05:13:43.230 --> 05:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
department say intervene and say okay
 
05:13:47.390 --> 05:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:50.590 --> 05:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
of so um as I said we don't have
 
05:13:52.750 --> 05:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over contractual disputes
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
between providers and um and carriers
 
05:13:59.310 --> 05:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
that being said you know the department
 
05:14:02.030 --> 05:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
is a resource available we have in the
 
05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
past and we continue to do so help to
 
05:14:06.868 --> 05:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
try to mediate disputes and get some
 
05:14:10.470 --> 05:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
common ground from those experiences
 
05:14:13.708 --> 05:14:13.718 align:start position:0%
it's not that there is one issue that
 
05:14:16.190 --> 05:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
just needs to be fixed it's not that you
 
05:14:17.708 --> 05:14:17.718 align:start position:0%
know these claims are not being
 
05:14:19.548 --> 05:14:19.558 align:start position:0%
processed because of this one thing it's
 
05:14:22.230 --> 05:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
a variety of issues and a lot of the
 
05:14:24.390 --> 05:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
time it's that the providers and the
 
05:14:26.070 --> 05:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
carriers are in a way talking a
 
05:14:27.670 --> 05:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
different language and they really do
 
05:14:29.230 --> 05:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
need to just get in the same room and
 
05:14:31.788 --> 05:14:31.798 align:start position:0%
work through these things and you know
 
05:14:34.708 --> 05:14:34.718 align:start position:0%
they do have um civil remedies available
 
05:14:36.350 --> 05:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
because this is a contractual dispute
 
05:14:37.788 --> 05:14:37.798 align:start position:0%
between the two
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
parties Mr chairman you're telling
 
05:14:42.310 --> 05:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
you're the physician should sue the
 
05:14:45.110 --> 05:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
insurance company I think that's a last
 
05:14:46.910 --> 05:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
resort I think they should be they'll be
 
05:14:48.990 --> 05:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
able to work out there
 
05:14:52.548 --> 05:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
difficulties yes and with regard with
 
05:14:56.510 --> 05:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
reference to you're not being able to
 
05:14:59.230 --> 05:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
intervene in terms of in in uh
 
05:15:02.510 --> 05:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
contractual disputes nevertheless last
 
05:15:06.270 --> 05:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
with from your Vantage Point are you
 
05:15:08.070 --> 05:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
seeing any
 
05:15:11.430 --> 05:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
patterns that are examples of what might
 
05:15:14.628 --> 05:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
be considered good faith
 
05:15:18.430 --> 05:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
or um suspicious in nature with respect
 
05:15:20.670 --> 05:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
to delays and I'm thinking once again
 
05:15:23.470 --> 05:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
about especially with respect to the
 
05:15:27.230 --> 05:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
clock questions that I posos you know
 
05:15:29.150 --> 05:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
the clock can stop at some point during
 
05:15:31.230 --> 05:15:31.240 align:start position:0%
the 180 days for information I I could
 
05:15:34.230 --> 05:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
see see that hypothetically as a
 
05:15:36.750 --> 05:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
stalling tactic if I wanted to take a
 
05:15:38.990 --> 05:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a dark view of all of this but I
 
05:15:41.470 --> 05:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just not being as involved as you
 
05:15:43.788 --> 05:15:43.798 align:start position:0%
all are I'm just wondering are there any
 
05:15:46.788 --> 05:15:46.798 align:start position:0%
points at which you are seeing things
 
05:15:49.030 --> 05:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
that even though you do not have the
 
05:15:52.548 --> 05:15:52.558 align:start position:0%
tools to be able to effectuate what the
 
05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
chairman is asking to to get things
 
05:15:59.350 --> 05:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
moved along more expeditiously are are
 
05:16:02.628 --> 05:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
you seeing any patterns of behavior that
 
05:16:04.830 --> 05:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
are are suspect and
 
05:16:07.230 --> 05:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
disturbing I have not seen any patterns
 
05:16:08.910 --> 05:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
along the lines of what you described
 
05:16:11.708 --> 05:16:11.718 align:start position:0%
and if I had if I was I would assure you
 
05:16:13.230 --> 05:16:13.240 align:start position:0%
that they would be getting a knock at
 
05:16:16.150 --> 05:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
the door from our enforcement unit uh as
 
05:16:19.110 --> 05:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
I said at the beginning what I see here
 
05:16:21.590 --> 05:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
are people who are trying as best as
 
05:16:24.070 --> 05:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
they can in good faith to work through
 
05:16:27.230 --> 05:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
an incredibly complex system I'll give
 
05:16:30.150 --> 05:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
you an example U Michelle myself Jason
 
05:16:34.590 --> 05:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
Dexter we personally sat in on I guess
 
05:16:36.030 --> 05:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
for a lack of a better term you could
 
05:16:38.990 --> 05:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
call a mediation session between a
 
05:16:41.390 --> 05:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
carrier and New Hampshire hospital we
 
05:16:42.948 --> 05:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
felt as though we had a special
 
05:16:44.868 --> 05:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
obligation to New Hampshire hospital
 
05:16:46.990 --> 05:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
being that they are a state entity and
 
05:16:49.390 --> 05:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
given the nature of the work that they
 
05:16:52.750 --> 05:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
do and to sit down and go through Claim
 
05:16:56.030 --> 05:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
by claim and understand the little ways
 
05:16:58.910 --> 05:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
in which these things can go sideways to
 
05:17:00.788 --> 05:17:00.798 align:start position:0%
Michelle's Point sometimes the
 
05:17:03.628 --> 05:17:03.638 align:start position:0%
communication breakdowns that happen uh
 
05:17:05.350 --> 05:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
where one person is referring to this
 
05:17:06.948 --> 05:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
thing the other person misinterprets
 
05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
what that thing is and then sometimes
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
there are just outright staffing issues
 
05:17:12.910 --> 05:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
I mean I think we all appreciate that
 
05:17:15.510 --> 05:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
across the state there's turnover
 
05:17:17.948 --> 05:17:17.958 align:start position:0%
there's there's Staffing challenges that
 
05:17:19.628 --> 05:17:19.638 align:start position:0%
all come together along with the
 
05:17:20.990 --> 05:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
complexity of the issues that we've
 
05:17:23.430 --> 05:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
talked about to cause
 
05:17:25.990 --> 05:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
delays um you know in sometimes it's a
 
05:17:29.270 --> 05:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
matter of hey uh we sent you an email
 
05:17:30.990 --> 05:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
several months ago saying that the only
 
05:17:34.070 --> 05:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
thing that we needed to properly
 
05:17:35.990 --> 05:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
adjudicate this claim was an explanation
 
05:17:38.430 --> 05:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
of benefits and say okay well where did
 
05:17:40.430 --> 05:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
that email go to well it went to Susan
 
05:17:43.510 --> 05:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
Jones well Susan Jones left three weeks
 
05:17:45.868 --> 05:17:45.878 align:start position:0%
ago so we've got to go through that
 
05:17:49.030 --> 05:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
whole process all over again um as I
 
05:17:52.948 --> 05:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
said it's it's a damnable misery it
 
05:17:54.590 --> 05:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
really is and and there there are no
 
05:17:56.990 --> 05:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
easy solutions here and I appreciate the
 
05:17:59.590 --> 05:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
frustrations I appreciate the pressure
 
05:18:00.910 --> 05:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
that the hospitals and the other
 
05:18:04.628 --> 05:18:04.638 align:start position:0%
providers are facing but I can't I can't
 
05:18:06.750 --> 05:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
come here and and always give you good
 
05:18:08.430 --> 05:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
news I can give you the truth which is
 
05:18:10.030 --> 05:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
what I will always try to do and the
 
05:18:12.510 --> 05:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
truth is is that the way we continue to
 
05:18:14.190 --> 05:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
make some progress with this is to go
 
05:18:16.830 --> 05:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
through this slow and yes long and
 
05:18:19.750 --> 05:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
arduous process uh but it is going to be
 
05:18:21.910 --> 05:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
the thing that will ultimately iron out
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
the issues and then as Michelle said as
 
05:18:26.230 --> 05:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
we go through this process if we are
 
05:18:29.430 --> 05:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
starting to identify systematic issues
 
05:18:32.030 --> 05:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh then it opens up another series of
 
05:18:34.150 --> 05:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
potential tools that we can bring to the
 
05:18:38.670 --> 05:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
table so Mr chair so um it it's
 
05:18:40.030 --> 05:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
interesting you use the word uh
 
05:18:42.510 --> 05:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
systematic or uh because I I I was
 
05:18:45.470 --> 05:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
thinking about if if this is if if
 
05:18:50.948 --> 05:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
you're not finding human issues that are
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
troubling so we're not talking about
 
05:18:54.830 --> 05:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
mistakes you know this went to Susan
 
05:18:58.310 --> 05:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
Jones she's not here anymore whatever so
 
05:19:02.788 --> 05:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
are are you as as you look at the system
 
05:19:06.788 --> 05:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the system is a good
 
05:19:09.990 --> 05:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
system and that it doesn't really need
 
05:19:13.070 --> 05:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
tweaking fixing or overhaul it's not the
 
05:19:16.310 --> 05:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
system that is the problem it's that we
 
05:19:18.310 --> 05:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
have people
 
05:19:20.948 --> 05:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
involved and the people who are feeling
 
05:19:24.830 --> 05:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
this of course are most uh that we're
 
05:19:27.708 --> 05:19:27.718 align:start position:0%
hearing from are the small uh providers
 
05:19:30.548 --> 05:19:30.558 align:start position:0%
and and the uh the patients the policy
 
05:19:32.750 --> 05:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
holders but it's it's not a system
 
05:19:34.708 --> 05:19:34.718 align:start position:0%
problem it's the
 
05:19:37.708 --> 05:19:37.718 align:start position:0%
complexity that's the issue but not the
 
05:19:40.510 --> 05:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
way in which the system is working it's
 
05:19:44.030 --> 05:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
the complexity within the system I think
 
05:19:45.990 --> 05:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
the answer to that is it's it can
 
05:19:47.548 --> 05:19:47.558 align:start position:0%
sometimes be both I mean it is
 
05:19:50.470 --> 05:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
consistent that the system is complex
 
05:19:51.910 --> 05:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
and yes it
 
05:19:53.910 --> 05:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
disproportionately causes headaches for
 
05:19:56.590 --> 05:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
the smaller providers who don't have big
 
05:19:59.310 --> 05:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
back office staffs individuals with
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
years of experience on how to properly
 
05:20:03.990 --> 05:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
build uh and how to properly handle
 
05:20:06.590 --> 05:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
these things yeah it's a it that
 
05:20:10.230 --> 05:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
complexity is and will always be a real
 
05:20:12.788 --> 05:20:12.798 align:start position:0%
challenge for them is there an
 
05:20:15.910 --> 05:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to simplify this system I'm
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
sure that there is that being said you
 
05:20:21.150 --> 05:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
know uh no system is ever going to be
 
05:20:23.708 --> 05:20:23.718 align:start position:0%
perfect and humans are not perfect so it
 
05:20:26.390 --> 05:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's not an absolute in terms of the
 
05:20:28.230 --> 05:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
system though because you raised yeah
 
05:20:30.030 --> 05:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
but so so I just want to stop you at the
 
05:20:32.708 --> 05:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
point we you you said can the system be
 
05:20:35.670 --> 05:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
simplified I'm sure it can be could
 
05:20:37.070 --> 05:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
could you elaborate on that yeah that
 
05:20:38.990 --> 05:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
would have to be a negotiation between
 
05:20:40.590 --> 05:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
the carrier and the provider as to how
 
05:20:41.948 --> 05:20:41.958 align:start position:0%
but you must have something in mind here
 
05:20:44.150 --> 05:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
when you say that it's well beyond my
 
05:20:45.750 --> 05:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
scope no no no no you're saying you
 
05:20:48.190 --> 05:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
believe that it can be simplified sure
 
05:20:49.788 --> 05:20:49.798 align:start position:0%
I'm a I'm an internal Optimist I got to
 
05:20:51.030 --> 05:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
believe there's a better way than what
 
05:20:52.830 --> 05:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
we're looking at it's rooted in optimism
 
05:20:54.070 --> 05:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that there are
 
05:20:55.628 --> 05:20:55.638 align:start position:0%
problems but you can't you you don't
 
05:20:58.350 --> 05:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
have any model in mind here that that
 
05:21:00.390 --> 05:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
would be a simpler model no not as I sit
 
05:21:01.868 --> 05:21:01.878 align:start position:0%
here today all right so I'm getting your
 
05:21:03.548 --> 05:21:03.558 align:start position:0%
optimism thanks you're getting my
 
05:21:05.270 --> 05:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
optimism I'll give it's one of the many
 
05:21:07.150 --> 05:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
services I provide representative Terry
 
05:21:07.160 --> 05:21:08.470 align:start position:0%
services I provide representative Terry
yes

05:21:08.470 --> 05:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:21:11.670 --> 05:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh but to to further elaborate on your
 
05:21:14.190 --> 05:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
point though there are times when the
 
05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
system itself will have an issue and
 
05:21:18.350 --> 05:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a PR an example the
 
05:21:20.750 --> 05:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
state's largest Carrier about two years
 
05:21:23.548 --> 05:21:23.558 align:start position:0%
ago now went through a systems migration
 
05:21:26.430 --> 05:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
in the process of that systems migration
 
05:21:29.230 --> 05:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
as is the case in most circumstances by
 
05:21:31.750 --> 05:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
which you have large systems
 
05:21:34.628 --> 05:21:34.638 align:start position:0%
migrations things didn't go as smoothly
 
05:21:38.190 --> 05:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
as was hoped and so that did create a
 
05:21:41.548 --> 05:21:41.558 align:start position:0%
problem now that problem was identified
 
05:21:45.788 --> 05:21:45.798 align:start position:0%
they're working to remedy the problem to
 
05:21:47.470 --> 05:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
um to my knowledge what has been
 
05:21:50.430 --> 05:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
represented to me is that the most
 
05:21:52.670 --> 05:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
glaring issues of that migration have
 
05:21:55.070 --> 05:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
been addressed but of course there is
 
05:21:57.670 --> 05:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
some residual issues from that that
 
05:21:59.548 --> 05:21:59.558 align:start position:0%
still have to be resolved so there are
 
05:22:01.628 --> 05:22:01.638 align:start position:0%
times when the system itself can break
 
05:22:04.750 --> 05:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
down and and not just be the human
 
05:22:08.070 --> 05:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:11.310 --> 05:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
that yeah I would I would not to split
 
05:22:12.750 --> 05:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
hairs here but I wouldn't consider that
 
05:22:15.510 --> 05:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
so much the system as the procedures
 
05:22:16.990 --> 05:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
that are utilized within the system
 
05:22:19.150 --> 05:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
because you just identified you know the
 
05:22:21.190 --> 05:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
that a change in the way in which the
 
05:22:24.830 --> 05:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
provider was was was uh handling these
 
05:22:26.830 --> 05:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
claims you know we're talking about
 
05:22:29.628 --> 05:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
software computer software so it's it's
 
05:22:32.708 --> 05:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
the it's not the process it's the it's
 
05:22:35.830 --> 05:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
the tools and the mechanisms sure that
 
05:22:38.470 --> 05:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
that that can create greater problems
 
05:22:40.070 --> 05:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
right yes okay the distinction that I
 
05:22:41.708 --> 05:22:41.718 align:start position:0%
was simply trying to make there was
 
05:22:43.990 --> 05:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
during that that period of time during
 
05:22:45.230 --> 05:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
that difficult
 
05:22:47.390 --> 05:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
transition the billing folks could have
 
05:22:49.350 --> 05:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
done everything exactly as they were
 
05:22:50.628 --> 05:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
supposed to have done it and it was
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:01.230 --> 05:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
out okay okay um before we take action I
 
05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
I do want to give the
 
05:23:03.360 --> 05:23:05.230 align:start position:0%
I do want to give the
uh

05:23:05.230 --> 05:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:23:08.628 --> 05:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
sponsor an opportunity to
 
05:23:23.948 --> 05:23:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:27.070 --> 05:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
so the sponsor well excuse me the
 
05:23:29.590 --> 05:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
sponsoring Association is the hospital
 
05:23:32.390 --> 05:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
Association I know you just promoted
 
05:23:34.390 --> 05:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
me now that you're retired maybe you
 
05:23:40.390 --> 05:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:43.990 --> 05:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
house I'm not qualified um so thank you
 
05:23:45.868 --> 05:23:45.878 align:start position:0%
for the record Paula minan Senior vice
 
05:23:47.110 --> 05:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
president state government relations for
 
05:23:48.350 --> 05:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Hospital Association
 
05:23:51.110 --> 05:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
we did ask Senator Susi to sponsor this
 
05:23:54.670 --> 05:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
bill um and um I appreciate you giving
 
05:23:56.868 --> 05:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
me the opportunity to speak for a couple
 
05:24:00.590 --> 05:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
minutes um so and I appreciate very much
 
05:24:02.830 --> 05:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
all the work um that went into this
 
05:24:05.190 --> 05:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
presentation and this was I thought
 
05:24:08.830 --> 05:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
really really well done I I think as and
 
05:24:10.670 --> 05:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
I won't quote anyone that spoke because
 
05:24:12.310 --> 05:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of people that spoke
 
05:24:16.390 --> 05:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
but um it is a very complex system um
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
and that's why prompt pay I would say
 
05:24:21.990 --> 05:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
back in I'm trying to remember I was a
 
05:24:24.510 --> 05:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
representative when this passed probably
 
05:24:28.830 --> 05:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
back in 2009 um when prompt pay passed
 
05:24:31.788 --> 05:24:31.798 align:start position:0%
um what we have found and why we asked
 
05:24:35.110 --> 05:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
this bill to be introduced was because
 
05:24:38.270 --> 05:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
there you know as laws as as you know
 
05:24:40.628 --> 05:24:40.638 align:start position:0%
after a while sometimes we need to um
 
05:24:42.628 --> 05:24:42.638 align:start position:0%
amend laws and that is why we were
 
05:24:45.390 --> 05:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
trying to address um and I'm not going
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
to get into specifics about any carrier
 
05:24:51.110 --> 05:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
but um we put this in for um because our
 
05:24:53.190 --> 05:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals you know have to build many
 
05:24:57.310 --> 05:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
many carriers um and the problem is and
 
05:24:59.470 --> 05:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
I think rep representative Terry was
 
05:25:01.470 --> 05:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
kind of getting to this it when the
 
05:25:04.510 --> 05:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
clock stops and the clock sort of stops
 
05:25:06.948 --> 05:25:06.958 align:start position:0%
um that's kind of the problem that the
 
05:25:11.070 --> 05:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
bill the the claim is pended or denied
 
05:25:13.948 --> 05:25:13.958 align:start position:0%
but when it's pended then you're asking
 
05:25:16.990 --> 05:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
for additional information and then
 
05:25:20.350 --> 05:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
nothing happens so that isn't a clean
 
05:25:23.990 --> 05:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
claim it's it's just sits there it's in
 
05:25:27.868 --> 05:25:27.878 align:start position:0%
their system it's a pended claim so this
 
05:25:30.070 --> 05:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
what I was we were attempting to do is
 
05:25:32.590 --> 05:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
to kind of close that make the clock
 
05:25:34.830 --> 05:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
start ticking again because it's not
 
05:25:38.310 --> 05:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
ticking um so so the part that we added
 
05:25:41.310 --> 05:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
was or to adjudicate the claim within 45
 
05:25:43.310 --> 05:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
calendar days of receipt of additional
 
05:25:46.070 --> 05:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
information and then current law is the
 
05:25:48.070 --> 05:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
claim shall be treated as a clean claim
 
05:25:51.270 --> 05:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
we added that clock start ticking again
 
05:25:53.230 --> 05:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
because it's not ticking that's the
 
05:25:55.750 --> 05:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
problem one of the problems the systems
 
05:26:00.670 --> 05:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
are very complex um and but they don't
 
05:26:03.708 --> 05:26:03.718 align:start position:0%
fall within the clean claim definition
 
05:26:07.510 --> 05:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
so that's what is the problem um because
 
05:26:11.548 --> 05:26:11.558 align:start position:0%
according to the carriers um what else
 
05:26:14.030 --> 05:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
did I so yeah pended I think it these
 
05:26:16.110 --> 05:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
statistics are interesting but another
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
interesting statistic would be to look
 
05:26:21.830 --> 05:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
at the overturn overturn rate of the
 
05:26:24.628 --> 05:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
denials um because we understand that um
 
05:26:27.910 --> 05:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
that that is just administratively just
 
05:26:29.910 --> 05:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
adds so much complexity to the system
 
05:26:31.150 --> 05:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
when you deny
 
05:26:34.590 --> 05:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
you appeal as Michelle um very
 
05:26:37.750 --> 05:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
accurately explained how again other
 
05:26:40.110 --> 05:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
another clock starts ticking but if
 
05:26:42.310 --> 05:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
you're ultimately going to pay the claim
 
05:26:43.948 --> 05:26:43.958 align:start position:0%
that would be a very interesting
 
05:26:45.948 --> 05:26:45.958 align:start position:0%
statistic because that that's just a lot
 
05:26:56.110 --> 05:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:59.070 --> 05:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
um and I think the exter I think her def
 
05:27:01.990 --> 05:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
her um statistic on external review was
 
05:27:06.270 --> 05:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
interesting too CU that one was um to go
 
05:27:08.350 --> 05:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
to external review that's pretty in
 
05:27:12.430 --> 05:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
intense um and for 46 claims 40% of
 
05:27:14.190 --> 05:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
those were overturned so I think that
 
05:27:16.310 --> 05:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's a really interesting statistic as
 
05:27:19.230 --> 05:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
well um but to get back to the bill
 
05:27:21.390 --> 05:27:21.400 align:start position:0%
which um I'm not sure I mean of course
 
05:27:23.590 --> 05:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
we want this we would like you to pass
 
05:27:25.830 --> 05:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
this bill we believe there is a need
 
05:27:29.150 --> 05:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
because again we're trying to address
 
05:27:32.670 --> 05:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
when they they're just sitting there so
 
05:27:34.628 --> 05:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
that's what that's why we were
 
05:27:35.628 --> 05:27:35.638 align:start position:0%
attempting that's what we were
 
05:27:38.990 --> 05:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:42.510 --> 05:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
bill um but I'm not at liberty or I
 
05:27:44.190 --> 05:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
don't think it's appropriate to get into
 
05:27:47.230 --> 05:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
specifics about um any
 
05:27:49.470 --> 05:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
particular process going on between
 
05:27:52.430 --> 05:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals and carriers um but in general
 
05:27:54.628 --> 05:27:54.638 align:start position:0%
that is what we always encourage is that
 
05:27:57.390 --> 05:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
they sit down and work through issue by
 
05:28:00.670 --> 05:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
issue I would contend and I I think some
 
05:28:02.390 --> 05:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
of you know but I worked for an
 
05:28:03.830 --> 05:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier I was provider
 
05:28:06.548 --> 05:28:06.558 align:start position:0%
relations director for 14 years so what
 
05:28:08.788 --> 05:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
I would always tell people is go out and
 
05:28:11.230 --> 05:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
meet with the provider and then let us
 
05:28:13.510 --> 05:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
know if there are systemic issues I
 
05:28:15.350 --> 05:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
would contend sometimes there are
 
05:28:18.788 --> 05:28:18.798 align:start position:0%
systemic issues and we as has been
 
05:28:21.110 --> 05:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
indicated by the commissioner when you
 
05:28:23.830 --> 05:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
go through a system um upgrade which
 
05:28:26.708 --> 05:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
hospitals do um emrs um electronic
 
05:28:29.548 --> 05:28:29.558 align:start position:0%
medical record when they go through um
 
05:28:31.470 --> 05:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
those system system upgrades they there
 
05:28:33.670 --> 05:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
are glitches but we've been dealing with
 
05:28:35.788 --> 05:28:35.798 align:start position:0%
some glitches with some carriers for
 
05:28:39.750 --> 05:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
over two years so that is a long time um
 
05:28:41.788 --> 05:28:41.798 align:start position:0%
so I would contend that there are still
 
05:28:44.788 --> 05:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
system issues and going through Claim by
 
05:28:47.548 --> 05:28:47.558 align:start position:0%
claim while it's helpful what really
 
05:28:49.910 --> 05:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
should be happening is figuring out the
 
05:28:52.548 --> 05:28:52.558 align:start position:0%
system issues that are the trends that
 
05:28:54.590 --> 05:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
are coming out of every single claim
 
05:28:55.948 --> 05:28:55.958 align:start position:0%
that you're reviewing because that is
 
05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
very time consuming for everyone so I
 
05:29:01.270 --> 05:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
think that's all I had I'm happy to
 
05:29:03.948 --> 05:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if I
 
05:29:03.958 --> 05:29:06.548 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if I
can

05:29:06.548 --> 05:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:29:09.868 --> 05:29:09.878 align:start position:0%
so with respect to my earlier questions
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
and following up on your remarks we're
 
05:29:17.350 --> 05:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
there are issues once a I I understand a
 
05:29:19.548 --> 05:29:19.558 align:start position:0%
claim does not become a clean claim when
 
05:29:21.708 --> 05:29:21.718 align:start position:0%
there's a problem right
 
05:29:26.110 --> 05:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
so so a a claim can go into pending
 
05:29:29.110 --> 05:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
status where presumably more information
 
05:29:31.948 --> 05:29:31.958 align:start position:0%
is being requested for whatever reasons
 
05:29:34.670 --> 05:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
correct but that that there is no there
 
05:29:36.590 --> 05:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
is no clock like there is in basketball
 
05:29:38.230 --> 05:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
you only get one minute for a timeout
 
05:29:39.470 --> 05:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
and then you everybody's got to go back
 
05:29:41.310 --> 05:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
out there and play again there is no
 
05:29:41.320 --> 05:29:42.430 align:start position:0%
out there and play again there is no
such

05:29:42.430 --> 05:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
such
 
05:29:45.590 --> 05:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
clock when when a claim goes into Penny
 
05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
it could be in there it could it could
 
05:29:50.310 --> 05:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
be pending indefinitely is that the
 
05:29:52.590 --> 05:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
issue you're identified and identifying
 
05:29:55.628 --> 05:29:55.638 align:start position:0%
and you want a time frame assigned to
 
05:29:57.750 --> 05:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
pending um thank you for your question
 
05:30:01.150 --> 05:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
so when I think Michelle and corly um
 
05:30:03.430 --> 05:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
identified when it it's pended and you
 
05:30:06.270 --> 05:30:06.280 align:start position:0%
request additional information the clock
 
05:30:09.670 --> 05:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
stops there for the for the carrier
 
05:30:11.310 --> 05:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
because they're waiting for the pro
 
05:30:13.230 --> 05:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
provider um unless there's something in
 
05:30:14.830 --> 05:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
the contract I'm not privy to those
 
05:30:17.070 --> 05:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
contracts so I wouldn't know but once
 
05:30:19.270 --> 05:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is what we have been
 
05:30:22.270 --> 05:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
told by our hospitals once the
 
05:30:24.990 --> 05:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
information is requested it's all I mean
 
05:30:26.390 --> 05:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
there are human beings working on the
 
05:30:28.150 --> 05:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
computers but it's all electronic of
 
05:30:31.030 --> 05:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
course so they see what is request Ed
 
05:30:32.788 --> 05:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
did they forget to provide a medical
 
05:30:35.310 --> 05:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
record did they need a lab test results
 
05:30:38.190 --> 05:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
something whatever it is they send
 
05:30:43.230 --> 05:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
that and then what doesn't happen is
 
05:30:44.830 --> 05:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
nothing happens on the other end so
 
05:30:48.030 --> 05:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
there is no clock so that's why I added
 
05:30:50.470 --> 05:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
we added the words that we did to make
 
05:30:53.390 --> 05:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
sure that after 45 days once you get the
 
05:30:53.400 --> 05:30:54.430 align:start position:0%
sure that after 45 days once you get the
additional

05:30:54.430 --> 05:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
additional
 
05:30:57.190 --> 05:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
information once you do something to the
 
05:30:59.910 --> 05:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
claim process it and if you don't
 
05:31:02.788 --> 05:31:02.798 align:start position:0%
process process it then then pay it as a
 
05:31:02.798 --> 05:31:05.628 align:start position:0%
process process it then then pay it as a
clean

05:31:05.628 --> 05:31:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:07.910 --> 05:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
claim so what you're doing is you're
 
05:31:11.190 --> 05:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
adding specificity in terms of what must
 
05:31:14.310 --> 05:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
be done within a certain time frame once
 
05:31:17.110 --> 05:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
certain information is received whereas
 
05:31:21.150 --> 05:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
now there is no specificity there is no
 
05:31:25.110 --> 05:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
time clock it could just stay there
 
05:31:27.270 --> 05:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
forever I've heard that it's not
 
05:31:29.270 --> 05:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
intentional there's no evidence of
 
05:31:31.030 --> 05:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
intentionality but let's just call it
 
05:31:33.830 --> 05:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
benign neglect or you know human error
 
05:31:35.350 --> 05:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
but what you want to do is tighten this
 
05:31:38.470 --> 05:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
up and say once the information is
 
05:31:41.150 --> 05:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
received you have 45 days to make a
 
05:31:43.110 --> 05:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
determination and then it goes to the
 
05:31:45.708 --> 05:31:45.718 align:start position:0%
next step and then we got another clock
 
05:31:50.708 --> 05:31:50.718 align:start position:0%
going on yes yes so do something with it
 
05:31:52.948 --> 05:31:52.958 align:start position:0%
and if it's whatever happens and like
 
05:31:54.548 --> 05:31:54.558 align:start position:0%
you said if there's more action that's
 
05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
needed then that you go to the next step
 
05:31:59.080 --> 05:32:00.948 align:start position:0%
needed then that you go to the next step
y

05:32:00.948 --> 05:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
y
 
05:32:04.948 --> 05:32:04.958 align:start position:0%
okay thank thank you all right so what
 
05:32:08.590 --> 05:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:08.600 --> 05:32:14.110 align:start position:0%
 
bill

05:32:14.110 --> 05:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:17.910 --> 05:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
stud right well I mean well the problem
 
05:32:20.948 --> 05:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
I would have to say Paula is that it's
 
05:32:24.350 --> 05:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
when you say just pay it okay well what
 
05:32:27.030 --> 05:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
happens if it wasn't going to get paid I
 
05:32:28.708 --> 05:32:28.718 align:start position:0%
mean what happens if there and they'll
 
05:32:31.070 --> 05:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
know within a certain period of time
 
05:32:33.310 --> 05:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
isn't just about a time period it's not
 
05:32:34.990 --> 05:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
about a decision it's not about a
 
05:32:38.948 --> 05:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
specific cir no the bill says pay it pay
 
05:32:41.310 --> 05:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
it after a certain point of time just
 
05:32:44.270 --> 05:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
pay it it must be paid regardless that's
 
05:32:46.350 --> 05:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
that's the way I read
 
05:32:51.548 --> 05:32:51.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:54.670 --> 05:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm not sure that this proposed
 
05:32:56.708 --> 05:32:56.718 align:start position:0%
language is necessary because under the
 
05:32:58.830 --> 05:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
law it already says that upon the health
 
05:33:00.590 --> 05:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
carrier's receipt of a requested
 
05:33:02.510 --> 05:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
information the health car shall
 
05:33:04.708 --> 05:33:04.718 align:start position:0%
adjudicate the claim within 45 calendar
 
05:33:07.390 --> 05:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
days so there is already a Time Fair
 
05:33:09.270 --> 05:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
time period built in there but again
 
05:33:11.548 --> 05:33:11.558 align:start position:0%
we're saying adjudicate the claim I'm
 
05:33:13.190 --> 05:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure what the exact language
 
05:33:16.150 --> 05:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
of this bill says but it would either be
 
05:33:17.628 --> 05:33:17.638 align:start position:0%
you pay it because it's covered or you
 
05:33:21.750 --> 05:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
deny it says pay it it says pay it as as
 
05:33:23.708 --> 05:33:23.718 align:start position:0%
though it was a clean claim right isn't
 
05:33:24.788 --> 05:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
that what it says
 
05:33:28.628 --> 05:33:28.638 align:start position:0%
Paula I want to go get it but yeah would
 
05:33:36.230 --> 05:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:39.350 --> 05:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
it does say that but it's not happening
 
05:33:42.628 --> 05:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
so that's what so then treat it as sort
 
05:33:45.270 --> 05:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
of like because it says if current law
 
05:33:48.548 --> 05:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
if the required notice is not provided
 
05:33:52.310 --> 05:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
so if the payer did not send the notice
 
05:33:53.910 --> 05:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
then the claim shall be treated as a
 
05:33:56.830 --> 05:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
clean claim so what we added was it
 
05:33:58.990 --> 05:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
looks like we added that entire bolded
 
05:34:01.750 --> 05:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
but we didn't so it just we added or to
 
05:34:03.670 --> 05:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
adjudicate the claim within 40 if they
 
05:34:07.230 --> 05:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
don't do that sentence above ahead they
 
05:34:09.310 --> 05:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
don't they don't if they don't do it
 
05:34:11.628 --> 05:34:11.638 align:start position:0%
then you have to pay it as a clean claim
 
05:34:15.270 --> 05:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
it I you're right but we're just saying
 
05:34:18.190 --> 05:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
process it so so that's the teeth in
 
05:34:19.830 --> 05:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
other words if you don't do this within
 
05:34:21.990 --> 05:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
45 days then you must pay it as a clean
 
05:34:24.030 --> 05:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
claim yeah no so there's the penalty
 
05:34:24.040 --> 05:34:24.948 align:start position:0%
claim yeah no so there's the penalty
you're

05:34:24.948 --> 05:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:34:27.470 --> 05:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
right okay that's one way so because the
 
05:34:29.030 --> 05:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
language is already that it has to be
 
05:34:31.070 --> 05:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
done within 4 5 days but it doesn't say
 
05:34:32.510 --> 05:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
what happens if you don't do it within
 
05:34:34.390 --> 05:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
45 days and you're saying right well
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
because the the the law doesn't say what
 
05:34:38.708 --> 05:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
has to be done after 45 days if 45 days
 
05:34:40.948 --> 05:34:40.958 align:start position:0%
expires this is what will have to happen
 
05:34:42.948 --> 05:34:42.958 align:start position:0%
this would be the consequence after 45
 
05:34:44.910 --> 05:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
days if if they don't do what they're
 
05:34:48.310 --> 05:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to do time that's a good way to
 
05:34:50.430 --> 05:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
describe it just boiling it down so that
 
05:34:52.670 --> 05:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
we can all understand
 
05:34:55.548 --> 05:34:55.558 align:start position:0%
this okay okay and so now the question
 
05:34:57.030 --> 05:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
be so what do we want to do with this is
 
05:34:59.470 --> 05:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
that true is that true the church is
 
05:35:05.470 --> 05:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:08.628 --> 05:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
so if you don't pay or adjudicate the
 
05:35:10.150 --> 05:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
claim within the time period and it does
 
05:35:12.390 --> 05:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
get covered there is an interest penalty
 
05:35:13.948 --> 05:35:13.958 align:start position:0%
so you would have to pay that additional
 
05:35:15.990 --> 05:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
interest so it to if it took you 60 days
 
05:35:18.430 --> 05:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
to adjudicate your and you had to
 
05:35:20.590 --> 05:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
request additional information you would
 
05:35:22.390 --> 05:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
have to pay that interest for that
 
05:35:24.830 --> 05:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
additional 15 days do you get involved
 
05:35:28.150 --> 05:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
after 45 days if as not necessarily
 
05:35:30.070 --> 05:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
because then it goes back to you know in
 
05:35:34.110 --> 05:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
the midst of a claims exam if that 7% if
 
05:35:37.750 --> 05:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
7% are handled um right if the error
 
05:35:41.390 --> 05:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
rate is less than 7% where pres the
 
05:35:42.590 --> 05:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
presumption is that they're being
 
05:35:44.390 --> 05:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
handled appropriately if it's greater
 
05:35:46.788 --> 05:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
than 7% then there's a presumption that
 
05:35:48.230 --> 05:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
they're not being handled in accordance
 
05:35:49.948 --> 05:35:49.958 align:start position:0%
with law we never presume that there's
 
05:35:51.750 --> 05:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
100% compliance but that's why that
 
05:35:53.548 --> 05:35:53.558 align:start position:0%
interest is built in so if they're
 
05:35:55.910 --> 05:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
unable to adjudicate that claim within
 
05:35:57.548 --> 05:35:57.558 align:start position:0%
the time period they do have to pay
 
05:36:00.430 --> 05:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
interest as well well who decides when
 
05:36:02.310 --> 05:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
the interest in the payment have to be
 
05:36:04.910 --> 05:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
made if it's past that time the carrier
 
05:36:07.390 --> 05:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
should be um adding that interest in and
 
05:36:09.590 --> 05:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
okay my understanding they usually do in
 
05:36:11.470 --> 05:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
the context of an examination we would
 
05:36:13.150 --> 05:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
go in and say if this was not paid
 
05:36:15.628 --> 05:36:15.638 align:start position:0%
within that time frame was interest paid
 
05:36:16.990 --> 05:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
as well and that would be one of the
 
05:36:18.230 --> 05:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
things we would be looking at in
 
05:36:20.548 --> 05:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
examination so iation so if I didn't
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
want to pay this and in 45 days expired
 
05:36:26.628 --> 05:36:26.638 align:start position:0%
now I have a certain rate of interest
 
05:36:29.190 --> 05:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
what is it market rate I mean um I would
 
05:36:30.830 --> 05:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
have to anyway so so now we have
 
05:36:34.430 --> 05:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
interest that is is being added onto the
 
05:36:36.990 --> 05:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
claim but now what why would I pay it
 
05:36:38.990 --> 05:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
this I mean hypothetically this is just
 
05:36:41.110 --> 05:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
this could go on forever yeah and this
 
05:36:42.788 --> 05:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
is where Market regulation comes who's
 
05:36:44.910 --> 05:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
going to make somebody do something the
 
05:36:46.708 --> 05:36:46.718 align:start position:0%
department would step in in those types
 
05:36:49.548 --> 05:36:49.558 align:start position:0%
of cases and if this situation were to
 
05:36:51.788 --> 05:36:51.798 align:start position:0%
come up we would hope that the provider
 
05:36:53.230 --> 05:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
would file an inquiry with the
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
Department in our consumer services we
 
05:36:58.590 --> 05:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
would take a look at it and we would you
 
05:37:00.830 --> 05:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
know probably tell the carrier why
 
05:37:02.590 --> 05:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
aren't you paying so so effectively is
 
05:37:04.548 --> 05:37:04.558 align:start position:0%
there a problem here you know so the so
 
05:37:06.628 --> 05:37:06.638 align:start position:0%
so the department gets involved here in
 
05:37:09.750 --> 05:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
and basically leans on them that's what
 
05:37:12.750 --> 05:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
happens one of the tools you can't make
 
05:37:15.230 --> 05:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
them pay but if they continue to resist
 
05:37:17.390 --> 05:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
paying and the interest charges are
 
05:37:19.510 --> 05:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
going up like you know the meter on the
 
05:37:22.470 --> 05:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
taxi you can lean on them and in other
 
05:37:24.510 --> 05:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
words it doesn't look good for them if
 
05:37:28.030 --> 05:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
they don't eventually process this yes
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify we cannot not
 
05:37:33.150 --> 05:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
require payment right that's but we can
 
05:37:35.750 --> 05:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
if they are not following the law we can
 
05:37:38.670 --> 05:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
sanction them for not following the
 
05:37:42.310 --> 05:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
law and and and so you you might be
 
05:37:43.628 --> 05:37:43.638 align:start position:0%
looking for a way in which they're not
 
05:37:47.750 --> 05:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
following the law because other
 
05:37:50.510 --> 05:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
than would that would not following the
 
05:37:52.590 --> 05:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
law mean that they didn't they didn't
 
05:37:54.830 --> 05:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
act in good faith within the 45 days yes
 
05:37:56.070 --> 05:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
if they you could make that
 
05:37:58.110 --> 05:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
determination yes if they were acting in
 
05:38:00.708 --> 05:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
bad Fai so you already have this
 
05:38:04.590 --> 05:38:04.600 align:start position:0%
yes so we don't really need this
 
05:38:07.350 --> 05:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
bill not do you take a position do you
 
05:38:09.868 --> 05:38:09.878 align:start position:0%
take a position on this I don't believe
 
05:38:12.788 --> 05:38:12.798 align:start position:0%
we have no we have not is it because you
 
05:38:14.390 --> 05:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
haven't taken a position or that you
 
05:38:17.310 --> 05:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
don't you don't choose to take a
 
05:38:19.708 --> 05:38:19.718 align:start position:0%
position you know I was not around when
 
05:38:22.230 --> 05:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
this don't ask her she she's only this
 
05:38:23.868 --> 05:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
is only her first year in the job how
 
05:38:26.150 --> 05:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
many no I've been here for four years I
 
05:38:28.030 --> 05:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
was on maternity leave in the last oh
 
05:38:30.910 --> 05:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay concerned with the way it was
 
05:38:34.110 --> 05:38:34.120 align:start position:0%
drafted and these issues that come out
 
05:38:36.910 --> 05:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
okay well here's the question I if go if
 
05:38:38.270 --> 05:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
I follow this
 
05:38:40.670 --> 05:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
conversation that theoretically at the
 
05:38:44.190 --> 05:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
end of the day that their interest is
 
05:38:46.990 --> 05:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
paid um and that's theoretically the
 
05:38:51.830 --> 05:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
penalty but but um it it is
 
05:38:55.548 --> 05:38:55.558 align:start position:0%
clearly the insurance company is not is
 
05:38:58.190 --> 05:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
violating the
 
05:39:00.310 --> 05:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
statute okay
 
05:39:04.788 --> 05:39:04.798 align:start position:0%
and the issue then is at that point is
 
05:39:07.468 --> 05:39:07.478 align:start position:0%
um that when there's a violation of a
 
05:39:11.830 --> 05:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
statute that we have the the Draconian
 
05:39:13.670 --> 05:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the Department to pull
 
05:39:15.868 --> 05:39:15.878 align:start position:0%
their license from for doing business
 
05:39:19.590 --> 05:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
because they keep uh systematically
 
05:39:23.190 --> 05:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
violating a statute so maybe what we
 
05:39:26.788 --> 05:39:26.798 align:start position:0%
should do is have some kind of have uh
 
05:39:29.230 --> 05:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
and I guess the way to do this right it
 
05:39:32.910 --> 05:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
would be the uh the the
 
05:39:35.310 --> 05:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
provider because in this case they're
 
05:39:37.230 --> 05:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
they're the they're the constituent
 
05:39:39.230 --> 05:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
who's being harmed by these insurance
 
05:39:42.468 --> 05:39:42.478 align:start position:0%
companies that on on that the uh
 
05:39:46.150 --> 05:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
providers uh should notify the
 
05:39:50.030 --> 05:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
department of of uh this violation and
 
05:39:52.350 --> 05:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
so at that point you you will now can
 
05:39:55.390 --> 05:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
start your collecting information about
 
05:39:57.468 --> 05:39:57.478 align:start position:0%
how often this insurance company is
 
05:39:59.948 --> 05:39:59.958 align:start position:0%
violating the that default yeah we do
 
05:40:04.190 --> 05:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
that and actually at a certain point we
 
05:40:06.150 --> 05:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
um took on that responsibility of
 
05:40:08.430 --> 05:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
separately taking complaints from Health
 
05:40:13.350 --> 05:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
Care Providers okay so but but so
 
05:40:18.948 --> 05:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
Paula if if if we put into the
 
05:40:22.468 --> 05:40:22.478 align:start position:0%
statute that that
 
05:40:25.190 --> 05:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh sorry we only have one mic maybe we
 
05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
maybe we can have you guys opposite mics
 
05:40:30.788 --> 05:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
here but um maybe we should
 
05:40:34.030 --> 05:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
have uh that you you
 
05:40:37.590 --> 05:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
the you uh the provider would have a
 
05:40:40.750 --> 05:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
form to notify the department that you
 
05:40:43.190 --> 05:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
here here we go again you got another
 
05:40:44.628 --> 05:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
one where they have paid on a timely
 
05:40:46.350 --> 05:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
fashion Mr chair why do we need to La I
 
05:40:48.070 --> 05:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
can just issue a
 
05:40:50.390 --> 05:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
bulletin uh this is not a bulletin
 
05:40:52.468 --> 05:40:52.478 align:start position:0%
material it's not bulletin material not
 
05:40:54.350 --> 05:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
we do appreciate that the department has
 
05:40:57.350 --> 05:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
now started collecting provider um
 
05:40:59.910 --> 05:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
concerns and there is um I think they're
 
05:41:02.868 --> 05:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
seeing more more of interaction um it's
 
05:41:05.670 --> 05:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
always been consumers and I think it was
 
05:41:08.150 --> 05:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
kind of a not I I'm not going to say it
 
05:41:10.030 --> 05:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
was assumed but of course providers are
 
05:41:12.430 --> 05:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
consumers too but it was really we
 
05:41:14.468 --> 05:41:14.478 align:start position:0%
always interpreted it it was really more
 
05:41:18.910 --> 05:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
a patient complaint um so now I think
 
05:41:20.910 --> 05:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
they've made it very explicit it's right
 
05:41:22.910 --> 05:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
on their website so I think that that is
 
05:41:25.628 --> 05:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
help very helpful um and I that may be
 
05:41:28.150 --> 05:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
another route that um I believe that is
 
05:41:30.270 --> 05:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
a route that the provider are are
 
05:41:33.150 --> 05:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
utilizing I just I was trying to text a
 
05:41:35.990 --> 05:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
colleague to to find out um I have not
 
05:41:39.350 --> 05:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
um back in the day um many years ago
 
05:41:41.190 --> 05:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
when I was doing a different job at the
 
05:41:43.670 --> 05:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
association my understanding and I don't
 
05:41:45.390 --> 05:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
know if this is still the case it's not
 
05:41:47.468 --> 05:41:47.478 align:start position:0%
an automatic the penal that that
 
05:41:49.788 --> 05:41:49.798 align:start position:0%
interest penalty does not automatically
 
05:41:53.948 --> 05:41:53.958 align:start position:0%
get applied to a paid claim the provider
 
05:41:57.350 --> 05:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
would have to basically submit a submit
 
05:42:00.270 --> 05:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
a a bill if you will um that has been at
 
05:42:02.708 --> 05:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
least some of the experience our members
 
05:42:05.628 --> 05:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
have had but I do not know that that is
 
05:42:07.990 --> 05:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
actually what happens now I have I'm
 
05:42:11.150 --> 05:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
trying to find out but it doesn't
 
05:42:14.350 --> 05:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
automatically happen necessarily um okay
 
05:42:16.150 --> 05:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
but you guys think it does right you
 
05:42:18.708 --> 05:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
think that insurance that that interest
 
05:42:20.750 --> 05:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be paid right away uh the
 
05:42:24.030 --> 05:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
law requires it that it automatically be
 
05:42:26.030 --> 05:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
added in but I think what Paul is saying
 
05:42:28.590 --> 05:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
is that doesn't always happen that that
 
05:42:30.590 --> 05:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
is one of the things the insurance
 
05:42:32.350 --> 05:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
company says well that's nice well you
 
05:42:35.270 --> 05:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
know where's the bill right the interest
 
05:42:37.750 --> 05:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
and when we do these Deep dive you know
 
05:42:39.990 --> 05:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
Market conduct exam looking at claims
 
05:42:41.510 --> 05:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things we look at was
 
05:42:45.990 --> 05:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
interest paid after 45 days okay all
 
05:42:48.708 --> 05:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
right so I I I'm I'm here's here's what
 
05:42:48.718 --> 05:42:50.070 align:start position:0%
right so I I I'm I'm here's here's what
I'm

05:42:50.070 --> 05:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:42:53.390 --> 05:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
thinking right who calculates to
 
05:42:56.350 --> 05:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
7% exactly how Howes how does this
 
05:42:58.708 --> 05:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
paperwork work so the insurance an him
 
05:43:01.910 --> 05:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
you you guys always pay that interest on
 
05:43:04.190 --> 05:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
time why don't you come over sit but and
 
05:43:07.390 --> 05:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:09.510 --> 05:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
here come on
 
05:43:12.548 --> 05:43:12.558 align:start position:0%
down here Saina yes you need to come up
 
05:43:16.230 --> 05:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
here yes from Anthem I talked to our um
 
05:43:19.150 --> 05:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
legal counsel earlier and was verifying
 
05:43:20.628 --> 05:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
that interest actually we have a system
 
05:43:22.430 --> 05:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
it automatically attaches and I believe
 
05:43:23.830 --> 05:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
the same as true for Signa and Harvard
 
05:43:27.070 --> 05:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim as well so we have a great
 
05:43:28.830 --> 05:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
interest in paying claims on time I just
 
05:43:31.910 --> 05:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
want to to put that out there so the
 
05:43:36.590 --> 05:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
providers uh add in the 7% after 45 days
 
05:43:38.628 --> 05:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
if they haven't paid the claim on our
 
05:43:40.788 --> 05:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
end it automatically you automatically
 
05:43:42.110 --> 05:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
begin the clock
 
05:43:44.670 --> 05:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
begins our system automatically attaches
 
05:43:46.110 --> 05:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
the required
 
05:43:48.990 --> 05:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
interest is that are you doing that
 
05:43:51.628 --> 05:43:51.638 align:start position:0%
voluntarily or because follow to follow
 
05:43:53.310 --> 05:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
the law follow well the law is
 
05:43:55.190 --> 05:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
instructing you to do that the
 
05:43:57.230 --> 05:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
department tells you you have to do that
 
05:43:59.230 --> 05:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
I believe that's correct if they telling
 
05:44:00.510 --> 05:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
us we are doing it but I believe it's
 
05:44:02.430 --> 05:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
correct that we were being told that is
 
05:44:04.670 --> 05:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
how to make sure we follow the law
 
05:44:08.830 --> 05:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
okay does that interest get added to the
 
05:44:11.948 --> 05:44:11.958 align:start position:0%
minimum minimum loss ratio is that
 
05:44:15.150 --> 05:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:17.990 --> 05:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
cost that's a good question well the
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
reason I asked that is not withstanding
 
05:44:22.510 --> 05:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
that I hate to think this is the reason
 
05:44:25.270 --> 05:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
why we are premiums are going up but is
 
05:44:27.948 --> 05:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
that is this a way for us to be able to
 
05:44:27.958 --> 05:44:29.548 align:start position:0%
that is this a way for us to be able to
track

05:44:29.548 --> 05:44:29.558 align:start position:0%
track
 
05:44:32.750 --> 05:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
how bad these payments are whether
 
05:44:33.990 --> 05:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
things you know whether these late
 
05:44:36.670 --> 05:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
payments problem is really occurring is
 
05:44:39.548 --> 05:44:39.558 align:start position:0%
that if you have to know that the
 
05:44:41.548 --> 05:44:41.558 align:start position:0%
department don't you guys need to know
 
05:44:43.270 --> 05:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
whether that money's where where that
 
05:44:45.310 --> 05:44:45.320 align:start position:0%
interest is coming from you know how
 
05:44:47.030 --> 05:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's build and whether it's part of
 
05:44:48.788 --> 05:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
the minimum and because if you don't
 
05:44:50.390 --> 05:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
know and I would say it's being thrown
 
05:44:52.390 --> 05:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
in the minimum loss ratio and that's
 
05:44:57.868 --> 05:44:57.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:57.878 --> 05:45:00.110 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:45:00.110 --> 05:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:45:04.350 --> 05:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
okay we will schedule this bill
 
05:45:08.670 --> 05:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
again okay on November 7th and I would
 
05:45:13.390 --> 05:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
like to hear a way in
 
05:45:16.350 --> 05:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
which instead of instead of passing what
 
05:45:18.868 --> 05:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
I consider this Draconian bill which
 
05:45:20.548 --> 05:45:20.558 align:start position:0%
says just pay it as though it's was a
 
05:45:24.190 --> 05:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
clean claim that I would like to see uh
 
05:45:26.350 --> 05:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
a system in place or something some
 
05:45:29.910 --> 05:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
propos way we could track it and so that
 
05:45:32.070 --> 05:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
you guys really do know how much of a
 
05:45:34.350 --> 05:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
problem it is out there and that these
 
05:45:35.990 --> 05:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
things are not getting
 
05:45:40.310 --> 05:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
paid and and and I say I would look at
 
05:45:42.430 --> 05:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
where that money is coming getting build
 
05:45:44.150 --> 05:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
and how it's getting built and how how
 
05:45:46.150 --> 05:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
you guys see it because I sure hope it's
 
05:45:49.150 --> 05:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
not going into my minimum loss ratio
 
05:45:49.160 --> 05:45:50.750 align:start position:0%
not going into my minimum loss ratio
number

05:45:50.750 --> 05:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:45:54.070 --> 05:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
right I will look into that too I I I'm
 
05:45:56.070 --> 05:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
fairly certain it does not it is a
 
05:45:58.350 --> 05:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
penalty for the so therefore when it
 
05:46:03.150 --> 05:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
when that reported to the to the
 
05:46:05.788 --> 05:46:05.798 align:start position:0%
department as in terms of your loss it's
 
05:46:08.070 --> 05:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
got to be segmented off right it's got
 
05:46:13.548 --> 05:46:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:16.110 --> 05:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
separation yeah I knew there was going
 
05:46:19.750 --> 05:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:21.868 --> 05:46:21.878 align:start position:0%
ratio okay does everybody know what I'm
 
05:46:25.468 --> 05:46:25.478 align:start position:0%
talking about yes our financial analysis
 
05:46:27.788 --> 05:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
team um does
 
05:46:31.350 --> 05:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
do consistent review of these issues and
 
05:46:33.390 --> 05:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
Money Matters and they're constantly
 
05:46:36.468 --> 05:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
reviewing a lot of financial information
 
05:46:38.390 --> 05:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
every quarter so I can follow up with
 
05:46:41.110 --> 05:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
them and find out exactly how penalties
 
05:46:44.270 --> 05:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
work into the medical loss ratio but be
 
05:46:46.350 --> 05:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
assured that our financial team is on it
 
05:46:48.270 --> 05:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
we are monitoring all the financials and
 
05:46:50.150 --> 05:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
if we saw something concerning in the
 
05:46:53.110 --> 05:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
financials that were to indicate um an
 
05:46:56.510 --> 05:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
improper business practice um that would
 
05:46:58.110 --> 05:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
be one of the things that could trigger
 
05:47:01.548 --> 05:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
a market cont cond investigation or
 
05:47:04.310 --> 05:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
examination okay yes I just have a quick
 
05:47:06.990 --> 05:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
question I guess I i' posst it to to
 
05:47:09.910 --> 05:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
Paula um we're talking about these
 
05:47:12.590 --> 05:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
numbers and the penalties etc etc but
 
05:47:14.910 --> 05:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
aren't there people at the at the end of
 
05:47:17.150 --> 05:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
at end of the day people who are who
 
05:47:20.070 --> 05:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
don't get a claim who are who are may be
 
05:47:22.750 --> 05:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
in real serious financial hardship
 
05:47:25.110 --> 05:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
because of claim was
 
05:47:27.670 --> 05:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
denied I'm sorry are we talking about
 
05:47:29.468 --> 05:47:29.478 align:start position:0%
the providers or yeah these are
 
05:47:32.628 --> 05:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
hospitals or all providers okay so the
 
05:47:35.310 --> 05:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
patient is not patient is not patient is
 
05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
not no as um Michelle said there are
 
05:47:41.150 --> 05:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
contractual well okay this a contract so
 
05:47:43.030 --> 05:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
if you're an in network provider you
 
05:47:45.510 --> 05:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
cannot you cannot balance Bill the
 
05:47:50.150 --> 05:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
patient right uh so thank you uh if you
 
05:47:52.948 --> 05:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
would just reiterate or or correct me on
 
05:47:56.030 --> 05:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
what I believe I heard a few minutes ago
 
05:48:00.310 --> 05:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
the department is provid information or
 
05:48:02.990 --> 05:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
given information to providers that
 
05:48:06.510 --> 05:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
reminds them shall we say of their
 
05:48:10.190 --> 05:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
obligation to try to collect from the
 
05:48:10.200 --> 05:48:11.948 align:start position:0%
obligation to try to collect from the
insurance

05:48:11.948 --> 05:48:11.958 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
05:48:17.788 --> 05:48:17.798 align:start position:0%
company uh rather than to more quickly
 
05:48:22.110 --> 05:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
default to going after the patient and
 
05:48:24.150 --> 05:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
is in did I hear you say they don't have
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
anything greater frequency that that
 
05:48:30.390 --> 05:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
that that that the providers are are
 
05:48:32.110 --> 05:48:32.120 align:start position:0%
trying to be more conscientious and
 
05:48:35.750 --> 05:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
aggressive about following up on claims
 
05:48:37.548 --> 05:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
that have been filed with the insurance
 
05:48:41.910 --> 05:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
carrier because we all know as
 
05:48:44.110 --> 05:48:44.120 align:start position:0%
patients there's that that statement
 
05:48:46.070 --> 05:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
that we all sign without reading that
 
05:48:51.708 --> 05:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
says that ultimately we will pay if the
 
05:48:54.468 --> 05:48:54.478 align:start position:0%
provider doesn't pay uh excuse me the
 
05:48:56.190 --> 05:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
insurance company doesn't pay and it
 
05:48:57.510 --> 05:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that that that would be
 
05:48:59.990 --> 05:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
an easy out for a provider who says I
 
05:49:01.628 --> 05:49:01.638 align:start position:0%
just don't want to be involved with this
 
05:49:03.670 --> 05:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
gigantic bureaucracy any longer I'm just
 
05:49:05.670 --> 05:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
going to go after and therefore then it
 
05:49:08.390 --> 05:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
come then it does come back on the
 
05:49:11.230 --> 05:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
policy holder and the patient who now is
 
05:49:13.310 --> 05:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
is is build for you know maybe hundreds
 
05:49:15.750 --> 05:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
or thousands of
 
05:49:18.910 --> 05:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
dollars it's for
 
05:49:21.990 --> 05:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
that form that we sign is if it's a
 
05:49:25.390 --> 05:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
non-covered service you can't build if
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
you have a contractual relationship with
 
05:49:30.350 --> 05:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
a carrier in that contractual
 
05:49:32.750 --> 05:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
relationship it in that contract it does
 
05:49:35.110 --> 05:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
say that you will not balance Bill a
 
05:49:38.390 --> 05:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
patient so no it's it's more for
 
05:49:40.910 --> 05:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
something that is not covered
 
05:49:44.150 --> 05:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately if we um if the insurance is
 
05:49:46.830 --> 05:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
not you know El if there's not eligible
 
05:49:49.310 --> 05:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
or whatever um if the insurance ran out
 
05:49:51.230 --> 05:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
if it was the wrong you know whatever um
 
05:49:53.430 --> 05:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
or just not a covered service that's
 
05:49:57.230 --> 05:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
what that is yeah
 
05:50:00.628 --> 05:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
yeah okay okay so you'll you guys will
 
05:50:02.350 --> 05:50:02.360 align:start position:0%
help us out so we
 
05:50:06.190 --> 05:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
can so we can not have to pass this bill
 
05:50:08.590 --> 05:50:08.600 align:start position:0%
but we need some way to you know make
 
05:50:11.788 --> 05:50:11.798 align:start position:0%
sure you're being notified that a if a
 
05:50:13.468 --> 05:50:13.478 align:start position:0%
carrier is
 
05:50:15.990 --> 05:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
is laps and getting these things done in
 
05:50:17.430 --> 05:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
a timely
 
05:50:17.440 --> 05:50:20.350 align:start position:0%
a timely
fashion

05:50:20.350 --> 05:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
great okay with that we're
 
05:50:24.000 --> 05:50:25.868 align:start position:0%
great okay with that we're
done

05:50:25.868 --> 05:50:25.878 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:50:28.990 --> 05:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
no uh no we're no we're going to meet
 
05:50:29.000 --> 05:50:33.030 align:start position:0%
