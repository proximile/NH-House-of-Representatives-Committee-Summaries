00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.790 align:start position:0%
statutes we interviewed commission

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
the definition of backlog is simply the
 
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
cases that have not yet been assigned to
 
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:30.500 align:start position:0%
an investigator
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know off the top of
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
your head how many cases are actually in
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
the pipeline that have not that have
 
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
been started but have not come to
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
conclusion yet do we know that
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't have that information
 
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.889 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't have that information
okay

00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:45.899 --> 00:14:48.290 align:start position:0%
okay
just

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so one of the
 
00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
things I think we'd be looking for is
 
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
how can we reduce the backlog and the
 
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
time a year is seems very excessive and
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
I know you'll look at other states and
 
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
and see what they have and perhaps the
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
federal government and see if if we're
 
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
worse than them better than them they
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
might all have a big backlog but if if
 
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
the pro if the problem is we don't have
 
00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
enough people then that's something we
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
would like to read about and maybe do
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
something about to correct because I
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
think a year and a 200 something backlog
 
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.060 --> 00:16:12.829 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense of
 
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
how long will it take to bring on board
 
00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.769 align:start position:0%
how long will it take to bring on board
those

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
four new investigators we're basically
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
doubling the size of the investigative
 
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.150 align:start position:0%
doubling the size of the investigative
team

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
team
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
well following up on representative
 
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
Wyler's question is there some National
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
Standard of caseload that these four
 
00:16:45.959 --> 00:16:47.470 align:start position:0%
Standard of caseload that these four
investigators

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
investigators
 
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:29.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:32.660 align:start position:0%
representative of Edwards
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you I as I recall uh the way
 
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
they are set up and the way they work
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
their cases is they make a case
 
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
determination and I forget what the
 
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
categories are but let's just say for
 
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
this that the categories range from uh
 
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
being validated and uh and action needs
 
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
to be taken to
 
00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
um something that didn't indicate to
 
00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:03.140 align:start position:0%
have Merit and so uh I would be curious
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh if the audit would be looking also at
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
over the course of time
 
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
or the the nature of the cases as
 
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
they're being adjudicated and and to see
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
if there's any kind of a correlation
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
between the amount of time it's taking
 
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
to get cases done relative to whether or
 
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
not you know whether they have Merit or
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
not and uh just to see if if uh we're
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
we're backlogging our system with
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
um not frivolous but uh cases that may
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
not have should not have been brought
 
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
there we go uh one of the difficulties
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
we have is the commission doesn't have a
 
00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299 align:start position:0%
database of cases so we're going to have
 
00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:03.980 align:start position:0%
to go in and use look at file reviews
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
by hand
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
they don't have anything automated that
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
we can get statistics out of so that
 
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
limits how long we can look back into
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
the past we anticipate we'll be able to
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
describe that for one of the fiscal
 
00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:21.419 align:start position:0%
years probably fiscal State fiscal year
 
00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
23 but to go further back than that
 
00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:27.299 align:start position:0%
would be difficult and I think the
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
categories you're looking for were
 
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.789 align:start position:0%
categories you're looking for were
um

00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
probable cause and no probable cause
 
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
that's one of the intermediary decisions
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:48.539 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so on that on that
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
same note it's it's actually surprising
 
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
to hear that they don't have a database
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
to sort of track outcomes
 
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
um and so perhaps that could be an area
 
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
that you look at in terms of comparison
 
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:00.419 align:start position:0%
to other states and certainly I see that
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
as impacting their efficiency if they're
 
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
not sort of tracking their management
 
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:06.380 align:start position:0%
processes thank you
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Wyler thank you madam
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
chair so another thing that occurs to me
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
without a database you might have the
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
same person bringing in complaints every
 
00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:18.539 align:start position:0%
other year about the same sort of thing
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
and you know so it becomes kind of just
 
00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
the game if you will trying to get some
 
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
other additional thing they want but
 
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
especially if they're going from job to
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
job and become a chronic complainer I
 
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
think that ought to be pointed out
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
and it by representative Weber any
 
00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:54.539 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
all right number of item number four is
 
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
the table suspended and potential audit
 
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.590 align:start position:0%
the table suspended and potential audit
topics

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
topics
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
Mr Henry
 
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:42.409 --> 00:21:42.419 align:start position:0%
with this we'll start with the Bureau of
 
00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
elderly and Adult Services that audit
 
00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:48.539 align:start position:0%
was suspended in November 2021 due to
 
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
appending Legal proceeding and uh
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
there's no update on that
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
next is the public access to bodies of
 
00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.169 align:start position:0%
next is the public access to bodies of
water

00:21:59.169 --> 00:21:59.179 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
audit topic that was tabled it was
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
decided not to move forward with that
 
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
audit as there might be another
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
committee responsible for that topic so
 
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:12.740 align:start position:0%
that was tabled
 
00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:15.299 align:start position:0%
then we have the Secretary of State's
 
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
archives and Records
 
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
this one it was tabled because it was
 
00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
unclear if the LBA had the authority and
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
statute to conduct a performance audit
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
here the LBA audit division statute RSA
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
14 colon 31a section d
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
excludes constitutional officers in the
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
execution of their constitutional duties
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
from a performance audit
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
we asked Senate research for the
 
00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
definition of of constitutional officers
 
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
and constitutional duties and to
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
identify which duties if any are
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
possibly auditable
 
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
according to Senate research which was
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
provided in your handouts there
 
00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419 align:start position:0%
is no definition of constitutional
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
officers or constitutional duties in the
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statutes
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
so without those definitions it Still
 
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
Remains unclear if we have the authority
 
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:21.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
there we go I wanted to address that
 
00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:36.299 align:start position:0%
issue I took a look at that memo and I
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
think it is true that the statute is the
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
statute is ambiguous as to whether
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
there's there's coverage but I do think
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
there's a strong argument to be made
 
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
that uh the legislature does have
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
authority to review the office I think
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
it's correct that the Secretary of
 
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
State's office or the officer is created
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
by the Constitution but all of their
 
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
duties are not their Duty there's no
 
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
Duty defined in our constitution all of
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
the duties are defined in State Statute
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
which the legislature
 
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
you know of course is responsible for
 
00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:13.559 align:start position:0%
and I think if you look at there was
 
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
some Supreme Court cases that that they
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
that Senate resource Senate research
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
identified and it's pretty clear that
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
um that part uh is very clear that the
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's Judy shall be those
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
of both legislative branch as well as
 
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
the executive executive branch so I
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
think there's a very strong argument
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
that even though the actual person
 
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:37.940 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is a constitutional
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
officer the office itself and the duties
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
are stack are statutory by nature and
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
therefore we do have authority to
 
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.990 align:start position:0%
therefore we do have authority to
audit

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative Wyler well I think the
 
00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
audit function is so important that we
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
ought to change the law if anybody on
 
00:24:59.810 --> 00:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
this committee would like to
 
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
proceed with a suggested legislation I
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
would be happy to co-sponsor because we
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
a few years ago when most of us were
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
still here we tried to audit the Supreme
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
Court or the court system
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
that was a two-year battle it should not
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
it should be clear that wherever we send
 
00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:21.539 align:start position:0%
money we should be able to audit them
 
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
and so when someone says oh no you don't
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
have the authority I'm thinking all
 
00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:27.539 align:start position:0%
right we're going to give ourselves The
 
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
Authority because the audit is too
 
00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
important they'll let somebody Escape
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber
 
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I think my
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
position is uh doesn't go quite as far
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
as representative Weiler's but I I do
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
share his sentiment about we need to
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
have accountability I think I perceive a
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
difference between the Secretary of
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
State's office which is as Senator
 
00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:58.919 align:start position:0%
Whitley says partially legislative and
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
partially executive in nature it is not
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
a separate branch of government the
 
00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is a separate branch and I
 
00:26:06.779 --> 00:26:08.110 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is a separate branch and I
think

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
my suggestion and I I will say that when
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
you put up your hand I had just written
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
the word need filing question mark
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
but I wonder if we could perhaps start
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
with the smaller bite of the Apple
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
and get that taken care of and then and
 
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
then think about a broader application
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
but I would be more than glad to talk to
 
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
you about that if if you would care to
 
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
when it gets when it gets
 
00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
my attitude like representative
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
weilhurst is we
 
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
fund them
 
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
program by program line by line it's
 
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
very different from so the motion is to
 
00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.970 align:start position:0%
very different from so the motion is to
remove

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
remove
 
00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
potential audit topic of the Secretary
 
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
of State archives and Records authored
 
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
Hill motion by Senate
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
all in favor I'm gonna just put one
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
wrinkle into this uh topic
 
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
um so it's the Constitutional officer
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
and I think we'd probably agree the
 
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is a constitutional
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
officer and then the Constitutional Duty
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
that's where we sort of go which which
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
of those and
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
um with the Secretary of State uh in the
 
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
Constitution Article 68 talks about the
 
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
records of the state shall be kept in
 
00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:33.900 align:start position:0%
the office of the secretary
 
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
I mean it says this duty of the
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
secretary so I don't know if that's I
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
mean Archives of the records I mean as
 
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:42.059 align:start position:0%
far if someone was going to say that's
 
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
one place we shouldn't go
 
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
because that seems like the strongest
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
case of the Constitution is calling it a
 
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.470 align:start position:0%
case of the Constitution is calling it a
duty

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
duty
 
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
again I'm not a lawyer I'm just throwing
 
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
it out to you I think if probably better
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
is if our statute was clarified
 
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
but I already saved five CE
 
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
is the vital records
 
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.590 align:start position:0%
is the vital records
statute

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
and it's given by
 
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
us to this Secretary of State's office
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
rap bad words
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
um just just a thought on this is that
 
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
to the extent that there are gel car
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
rules that govern the record-keeping I
 
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
would think those would be auditable and
 
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:39.299 align:start position:0%
I would go further and say to the extent
 
00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:42.419 align:start position:0%
that the Secretary of State's office has
 
00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:45.299 align:start position:0%
developed standard operating procedures
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
or protocols on how they say they want
 
00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:49.210 align:start position:0%
or protocols on how they say they want
to

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:49.220 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
administer their records I would think
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
that those would be auditable without
 
00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.210 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:01.220 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
motion from Senator link
 
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.710 align:start position:0%
motion from Senator link
sure

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
move to approve the scope of work
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
okay so I think the motion is to
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
by Senator Lang seconded by Senator
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
Pearl further discussion remember while
 
00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
if a legislation is filed in September
 
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
which will come up in January
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
at what time span are you going to be
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:38.539 align:start position:0%
it depends how many times
 
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
it also depends if you have a priority
 
00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
if you want something done okay before
 
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
something else
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
I do have the freedom accounts and then
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
we'll have to start sometime after I
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
think October this year so you know we
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
do have yeah we'd like to have a list of
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
audits to do and then we can also look
 
00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
at who we have ready to do the audits
 
00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:00.539 align:start position:0%
how many people we have so but if you
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
have something you want done
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
well if if you feel more confident if we
 
00:30:09.409 --> 00:30:09.419 align:start position:0%
have legislation that says describes
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
that these Duties are you know then when
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
you go ahead there can't be that
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
roadblock so if if you're not starting
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
till February or March
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
or April right then hopefully the
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
legislation will be in place
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
I think the issue here is either we have
 
00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
the authority to do it now
 
00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
or it is a constitutional Duty and the
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
only way we're going to get it to stop
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
being a constitutional duty is by
 
00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
amending the Constitution
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
so I think we need to think about that
 
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.810 align:start position:0%
so I think we need to think about that
um

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:49.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
I my vote would be to go ahead and try
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
it and see where we get
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
um uh but
 
00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.510 align:start position:0%
um uh but
if

00:30:59.510 --> 00:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
I mean you know there could be a court
 
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
case in the the justices could say this
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
is not this is a constitutional Duty in
 
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
which case the only remedy
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
is amending the Constitution it is not
 
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
the Constitution cannot be overridden by
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
a statute
 
00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
and that's black letter law uh so I
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
disagree representative okay did you
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
have your microphone on
 
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
is there a further discussion we have a
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
motion to proceed within audit that's
 
00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.110 align:start position:0%
motion to proceed within audit that's
already

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
right in the pipeline and it's just
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
waiting for a determination of who may
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
be but but the law what you said was
 
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
effective October these changes in play
 
00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:51.059 align:start position:0%
and get an opportunity for them to kind
 
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
of work through it and see how they're
 
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
gonna respond
 
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
apparently I spoke too long
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
the department was undergoing a
 
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
transition and had some turnover in
 
00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
their office the back of the table if
 
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
not I'm sorry under the table a little
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
about it that I'm wondering you know how
 
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
many contracts how many different
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
agencies and so on how many different
 
00:32:15.289 --> 00:32:15.299 align:start position:0%
agencies and so on and so forth the
 
00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:18.059 align:start position:0%
piece you have yes generally
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
turn me off again on us answers
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
virtually all of my questions and so
 
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
forth the piece you have yes Senator
 
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.330 align:start position:0%
forth the piece you have yes Senator
away

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
turn me off again you know out of Public
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
Health for a public awareness campaign
 
00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
or if it is a contract with some of our
 
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
homeless and housing providers those
 
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
will fall under our I.T related
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
contracts as well would also be captured
 
00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:45.299 align:start position:0%
within that category and and that's to
 
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
stand so I believe in 2021 we gave you a
 
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
significance and is doing an absolutely
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
fantastic job
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
based on on those needs has you know
 
00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:57.299 align:start position:0%
solved those issues and whether we still
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
see this problem an amount of resources
 
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
towards improving that process then
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
we've continued to measure the time that
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
it takes to develop an RFP to get to
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
contract we implemented a lean metrics
 
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:12.419 align:start position:0%
around time to do contracts and I know
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's but but you're silent on that and I
 
00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:16.519 align:start position:0%
think that's been one of your major
 
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
sales points is what other sort of needs
 
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
might you anticipate of audit would find
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
reduce time upon the way the contract's
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
been written and the way the contract
 
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
staff been the for the program staff who
 
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
are standified and are working on now
 
00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:33.059 align:start position:0%
are in the Commissioners finding the
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
goals of the contract elf earlier this
 
00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:37.019 align:start position:0%
year so I think what Roberts identified
 
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
is that we want to work beating those
 
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
goals so that's another area we're
 
00:33:42.409 --> 00:33:42.419 align:start position:0%
working on
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
I think based on that that's that was
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
very helpful understanding how your
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
office is uh interplaying with the
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
Contracting Office maybe this is
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
something much more complex so
 
00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
um you know it's not a it's not a
 
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all process and and
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
figuring out
 
00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:06.419 align:start position:0%
um you know I think starting by taking
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
the obvious low-hanging fruit of if we
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
have things that are being
 
00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:15.500 align:start position:0%
uh generated online typed scanned
 
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
re-re-typed re-entered into a
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet you know surely we can get
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
to the point where somehow we can
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate all of those steps and and I'm
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.349 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
yeah some of us are hoping to make a
 
00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.129 --> 00:34:42.139 align:start position:0%
um next
 
00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:53.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:53.099 --> 00:34:56.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:59.570 --> 00:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
just like I think Mr Henry can arrange
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
this to happen in February but if he at
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
least he hasn't he's also looking to us
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
for a list of what he wants to move on
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
next so I would rather have it on his
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
list with that timing recommended thank
 
00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.410 align:start position:0%
list with that timing recommended thank
you

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.089 align:start position:0%
you
representative

00:35:14.089 --> 00:35:14.099 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
and I respectfully disagree I think it's
 
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:23.339 align:start position:0%
too soon to put it on because I don't
 
00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
think we have a clear idea of what
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
exactly it is we want to look at
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
um and and I would be happier keeping it
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
on the table and addressing it again at
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
the next meeting when we have a little
 
00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:38.339 align:start position:0%
more idea
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
when what's going on it seems to me that
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
we have already
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of stuff in the
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
pipeline you probably need more
 
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
but I think you know perhaps having
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
another meeting in the not too distant
 
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.890 align:start position:0%
another meeting in the not too distant
future

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
um in in in the fall when we have more
 
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
of our members around and and thinking
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
about these things uh to see if we can
 
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
generate more of a list but it sounds to
 
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
me that you actually have a fair amount
 
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:09.310 align:start position:0%
on your plate
 
00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:13.810 align:start position:0%
on your plate
[Music]

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:13.820 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.609 align:start position:0%
[Music]
right

00:36:15.609 --> 00:36:15.619 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
not going to be finished until next year
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
so you you have a lot to be going on
 
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
with with my sense
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you I also think we just leave
 
00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
this as a potential audit topic for now
 
00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:38.339 align:start position:0%
and mainly the reason being is I'm a
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
little concerned we're talking about all
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
the changes they're making and and
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
audits are retrospective they look
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
backwards and yet they're going to be
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
looking at something that's no longer
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
actually happening because we've made a
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of changes so I'm a little
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
concerned about doing an audit now it's
 
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
just a waste of State effort and we
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
should probably keep it in our mind but
 
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
take a look at their progress on what
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
their changes are
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
I agree and I think we should see what
 
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
the effect of the Medicaid rate
 
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
increases are because maybe some of
 
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.150 align:start position:0%
increases are because maybe some of
those

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints will be resolved
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
by a better Workforce I mean a more
 
00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
robust Workforce Senator Whitley
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
yeah not only uh I would agree not only
 
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
the increases but we also have another
 
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
bill to sort of Tide over our providers
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
in the DD system or our families in the
 
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
DD system and while this change is going
 
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
on we're allowing them to raise their
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
budgets and so I think some of those
 
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.250 align:start position:0%
budgets and so I think some of those
um

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
so I think in that meantime that's going
 
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
to help in terms of new topics you know
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative Weber just mentioned the
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
incident where two of our children were
 
00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:48.140 align:start position:0%
placed in a very inappropriate
 
00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
non-therapeutic uh facility in Tennessee
 
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
and what comes to mind to me in that
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
issue is this sort of interplay between
 
00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
dcif and children's Behavioral Health
 
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
they work together a lot now
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
um but they are very separate agencies
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
and they often they are dealing with the
 
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
same children and as we're building the
 
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health System
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
um the whole idea is that you know we'll
 
00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
have less families that are involved
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
with dcyf but but right now we have a
 
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
lot in both we have a lot of families in
 
00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
both systems and a lot of children that
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
are in both systems and so I mean I
 
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
think it is pretty problematic that any
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
child from New Hampshire did end up in
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
this facility has you know um
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
it it's not it you know regardless of
 
00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
whether they were placed by dcaf or
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health I think
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
exploring how that happened is important
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's a larger question of
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
how these systems fit together and
 
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
whether there's a need for more system
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
integration with our children's health
 
00:38:48.119 --> 00:38:49.550 align:start position:0%
integration with our children's health
system

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
um so that's something that I would be
 
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
really interested in learning more about
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
and also accompanied with that is that
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
folks on the finance committee know very
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
well that the children's Behavioral
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
Health budget is very high and it's high
 
00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
because we are at this point we're in
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
the middle of system change and also we
 
00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
are seeing more children in the Medicaid
 
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
system because uh what I understand from
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
the children's Behavioral Health Bureau
 
00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
is that private insurance is not
 
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
covering what is necessary so they're
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
pushing these high knee children into
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid system that's another issue
 
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
that I would be very interested in in
 
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
seeing whether you know the
 
00:39:29.569 --> 00:39:29.579 align:start position:0%
dramatic increase of children in that
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
system is happening because our private
 
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
insurance aren't doing what they need to
 
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:33.530 align:start position:0%
insurance aren't doing what they need to
do

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
so I guess giving all this conversation
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
on these last two items I guess what I'd
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
be looking for is a given all a
 
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
conversation what's the scope of work
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
look like what are we actually looking
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
to do here and and and maybe develop a
 
00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
scope of work that we can vote on and
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
and look at for a future audit but I
 
00:39:52.609 --> 00:39:52.619 align:start position:0%
think everyone agrees that right now
 
00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
it's probably not the time while they're
 
00:39:56.329 --> 00:39:56.339 align:start position:0%
making all these changes
 
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
you mean on
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Developmental services or
 
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
on dcyf versus
 
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you the last two items we just
 
00:40:10.849 --> 00:40:10.859 align:start position:0%
discussed the contract management piece
 
00:40:14.089 --> 00:40:14.099 align:start position:0%
as well as the behavioral health right I
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
think we've both just we've we've we've
 
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
had a conversation about I think what's
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
what a scope of work might look like to
 
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
make potent to look at and to see what
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
we get for corrective actions but I
 
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
think we've also discussed and said that
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
neither one of them are ready for prime
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
time right now and so having a scope of
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
work to look at exactly what we're going
 
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
to be auditing and what we're going to
 
00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:34.700 align:start position:0%
be looking for that performance audit
 
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
similar to what we just saw for the
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
human rights scope of work we voted on
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
um if we can see that that would be
 
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
helpful now it's moving forward and give
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
us time for for them to adapt that scope
 
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
of work for for our discussion
 
00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:53.339 align:start position:0%
well now I have two things if I might um
 
00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:55.619 align:start position:0%
the first before I forget it was in
 
00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
response to Senator Whitley and while I
 
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
am as interested as she is in the
 
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:03.980 align:start position:0%
explosion of
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
Developmental services that sounds to me
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
more like a study committee than a
 
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
performance audit because you're talking
 
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:13.619 align:start position:0%
about what's happening with Private
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
Industry so
 
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
um that that might be a way of dealing
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
with that particular issue
 
00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.370 align:start position:0%
with that particular issue
um

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
I think we have a procedural issue with
 
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang's suggestion because we we
 
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
vote the audit and then the scope
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
statement is created so and and I think
 
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
the scope statement isn't created until
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
after the audit has also gone to fiscal
 
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
is that not correct doesn't the audit
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
have to be approved not only by us but
 
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
by fiscal before you start with a scope
 
00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
statement yes that's right so we can't
 
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
just say oh please please scope
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
something that that that's a procedure
 
00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.010 align:start position:0%
something that that that's a procedure
that's

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
I think it's our job to narrow down a
 
00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
little more what we want people to look
 
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
at uh before and and when we have
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
something that's a little more specific
 
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
then we can go forward with it but I
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
think I think for me the comment about
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
audits are backward looking and when we
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
have a system in transition taking a
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
backward look at what we were doing
 
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
wrong before we did something different
 
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:20.339 align:start position:0%
isn't very helpful what we need to do is
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
wait and find out if what we're doing
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
differently is effective or not
 
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I'll I'll keep it
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
short because we do have noon upon us
 
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.690 align:start position:0%
short because we do have noon upon us
but

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:35.099 align:start position:0%
um just on specifically on the housing
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
practices subparagraph two here I I
 
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
think this one's a little bit more
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
cooked than the other ones because as I
 
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
understand what this one wants to be is
 
00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:51.020 align:start position:0%
a review of the demands for housing
 
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
situations within BDS and the available
 
00:42:59.690 --> 00:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
stock that we have in state and when we
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
don't have available stock and state
 
00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
we're out placing people in other states
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
at a tremendously High expense and so so
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
what I think that performance audit
 
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
would want to look at is whether or not
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
we're making a good business decision on
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
our investment levels of housing stock
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
for BDS
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
due to the negative costs of having to
 
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
refer people out of state that that's
 
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
what I think that performance Otto wants
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then Senator
 
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.190 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then Senator
Whitley

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
Whitley
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
and again that sounds an awful lot like
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
of study committee to me more than a
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.140 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I and I
 
00:43:58.849 --> 00:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
um I believe we might be conflating two
 
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
issues I think the people that are going
 
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
out of the state are children in the
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
dcyf behavioral health system not adults
 
00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:08.339 align:start position:0%
with disabilities or children with
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
disabilities I'm not aware of
 
00:44:10.859 --> 00:44:12.050 align:start position:0%
disabilities I'm not aware of
um

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
adults or children with disabilities
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
being sent out of state
 
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
well I think there are
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
perhaps if there's a dual diagnosis but
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
you know our DD system is much more
 
00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.630 align:start position:0%
you know our DD system is much more
um

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
were decades in advance in terms of the
 
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
provision of community-based services
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
and so we just don't see a lot of those
 
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
folks being pushed out of state where
 
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
where in the children's system we have a
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
lot of children being placed out of
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay well
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
the house has to go to another meeting
 
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna have to wrap this up
 
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that the next meeting we'll
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
talk more about what we could do with
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
BDS and I I was just thrown out throw
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
out one other idea just for everyone to
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
think about as a potential topic and
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
that is the doorways
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
which we've had for seven eight years 50
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
plus million dollars
 
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
and we've never taken a look at how
 
00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
effective they are
 
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:26.510 align:start position:0%
effective they are
so

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
any final thoughts could could we ask
 
00:45:35.809 --> 00:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
for that to be put on the list so that
 
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
those of us who allow our brains to
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
empty during the summer are reminded of
 
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
it because I think that that's a very
 
00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
anything further than if not
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
okay the next meeting will be it's the
