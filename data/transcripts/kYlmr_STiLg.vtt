00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on house bill
 
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
on that'll be helpful
 
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
get it down to my level
 
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.670 align:start position:0%
get it down to my level
um

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.830 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so for the record i'm
 
00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 align:start position:0%
jerry conner carroll county three
 
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
this is i think all you know i've done a
 
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
lot of work in healthcare this is my
 
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
transition from healthcare to death care
 
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
just for fun so any case um
 
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
with as with many bills there is a
 
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
backstory to hb 1320.
 
00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
i'm currently serving as a mentor for
 
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
anya nickel she's a constituent
 
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
and a girl scout working on a gold award
 
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
and she's here to testify today
 
00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 align:start position:0%
she's taken on the task of advocating
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
for natural or green burials
 
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
burial is when you are buried without
 
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
being embalmed
 
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
using a simple casket or shroud and
 
00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
without a concrete vault or maybe just
 
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
some portions of those changes
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
natural burial and avoids the
 
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
environmental degradation due to
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
leaching of embalming chemicals
 
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
into the environment and it consumes far
 
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
fewer resources and less energy
 
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
than current traditional burial or
 
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.789 align:start position:0%
than current traditional burial or
cremation

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
cremation
 
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
and is much less expensive than either
 
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 align:start position:0%
of those as well
 
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
natural burial is not prohibited by
 
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
state law but many cemeteries do not
 
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
allow it
 
00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
due to custom and their own regulations
 
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
so therefore ms nichols work is going to
 
00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
be two pronged effort that i'm working
 
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
with her on involving advocacy with
 
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
local cemetery trustees
 
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
to law natural burial and addressing
 
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
embalming legislatively
 
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
now it's actually kind of odd to call
 
00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
burial of an embalmed body in a large
 
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
casket in a cement vault a traditional
 
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.630 align:start position:0%
casket in a cement vault a traditional
burial

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
burial
 
00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
because traditional burial for millennia
 
00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 align:start position:0%
and still now in many parts of the world
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
is what we would call a natural burial
 
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
embalming became much more common in the
 
00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
mid 19th century to allow viewing of the
 
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
dead body over a short number of days
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
and embalmers do a fantastic job if that
 
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
is desired
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
but embalming is not done in most of the
 
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
world and is forbidden in judaism and
 
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.749 align:start position:0%
world and is forbidden in judaism and
islam

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
islam
 
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
now we only have one embalming statute
 
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
at least that i've been able to find rsa
 
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 align:start position:0%
tb2540a which states
 
00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:32.629 align:start position:0%
tb2540a which states
quote

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
quote
 
00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
no dead human body shall be exposed to
 
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
the public for a period
 
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
in excess of 24 hours
 
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
unless said body is properly embalmed
 
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
now that's can be kind of prone to
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation both by funeral
 
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
professionals and the lay people
 
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
suggesting that embalming is required
 
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
when it is not
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
the current statute dates from 1971 is
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
really probably not needed
 
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
and we're the only state that has this
 
00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
kind of unnecessary misleading law
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
embalming is not really necessary
 
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
from a public health point of view
 
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's actually even
 
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
contraindicated for example embalming a
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
person who died from hiv or tuberculosis
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
particularly done soon after death not a
 
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
long time
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
potentially exposes to disease
 
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
the embalmer who's entering body cavity
 
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
is handling blood and tissues
 
00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
those viewing the body are not at risk
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
and respiratory diseases are
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
not very likely to be transmitted from a
 
00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
dead body
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
because they don't breathe a whole lot
 
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
so they don't generate very many
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
droplets or aerosols
 
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 align:start position:0%
refrigeration is an option that can take
 
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
the place of embalming
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
if preservation is needed due to a delay
 
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
in viewing or burial
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
now the bottom line is that hp 1320 is
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
very straightforward it just repeals the
 
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.029 align:start position:0%
very straightforward it just repeals the
statute

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
it does not prohibit
 
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.790 align:start position:0%
it does not prohibit
embalming

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
embalming
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
embalming will still be an option
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's an option
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
that people can choose
 
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
it's an option that can be a policy of a
 
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
funeral home if they choose
 
00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
but this gives the deceased and their
 
00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
family a choice unfettered by an
 
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
outdated and confusing statute
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
i'd be glad to take questions on some of
 
00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
the specifics i do have a couple people
 
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
that work in this more and i think we
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
have some representatives from the
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
funeral homes also here
 
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
as i said anya nicholas here to testify
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
how do you tell us is this on
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
um in would you would you suggest that
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
if the body would be
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh viewed
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
you know as part of the funeral
 
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.830 align:start position:0%
you know as part of the funeral
viewed

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
viewed
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
longer than 24 hours would you put some
 
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
kind of criteria in there that would
 
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
have to be held for a certain
 
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
temperature for a limited number of
 
00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
hours one could but i think there's
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
since that is the
 
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
the simple alternative
 
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.990 align:start position:0%
the simple alternative
that

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah the funeral home themselves should
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
develop what policy they want because
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
the problem is going to be simply a
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
matter of aroma
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
and if they're concerned about that they
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
would refrigerate it but you know it's
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's not too tricky you'd refrigerate
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
the same way you'd refrigerate just
 
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
about anything
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
except you pardon
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up except you would
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
need a refrigerator at the right size
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
well yes but again that's that's
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
something that would be their own choice
 
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
in their own policy it could be a
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
marketing thing a particular place might
 
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.670 align:start position:0%
marketing thing a particular place might
say

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
we provide refrigeration other ones
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
would say no we don't provide that just
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
you know it would be there it would be a
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
choice a policy of the
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
funeral home and they would do it
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
whichever way they would feel most
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable and then the um
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
the consumer shall we say or their
 
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.710 align:start position:0%
the consumer shall we say or their
family

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
would then make the choice of where they
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
yes well first of all that really isn't
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
germane to this bill i should point out
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
because one could
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
repeal the statute on embalming and
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
still a cemetery may choose to have
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
their own rules about cement vaults
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's why it's a two-pronged job for
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
miss nickel but the issue is that that
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
is a surmountable thing first off many
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
people who are going to choose such a
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
thing would also not choose a giant
 
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.029 align:start position:0%
thing would also not choose a giant
heavy

00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
heavy
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
casket mahogany casket they might choose
 
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
a shroud so all you're doing is really
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
adding a little matter to the soil
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
you're not actually taking away and just
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
like if anybody's ever
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
dug a hole to put something in and you
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
when you put it level sure it's going to
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
sink so what do you do you mound it up
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
this isn't rocket science you mound it
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
it settles over time so that's you know
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
that's that's a surmountable issue we
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
don't have cave-ins and things like that
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
and cement vaults tend to leak anyway
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
but again that i should that's a little
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
off topic on this particular bill
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
but very important
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
any other questions of the
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
i have one would this would this mean
 
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.870 align:start position:0%
i have one would this would this mean
that

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.630 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
at my death
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
i could be buried in the ground
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh in the
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
chapel uh memorial garden at our uh
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
faith-based medical center
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
and there's no regulations that says my
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
wife could not bury me in that spot
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
actually again that's a little far
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
afield from the scope of this bill no
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
but your closest guy
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
i think the experts behind me could
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
conceivably answer that and but the
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
thing is there are rules about
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
cemeteries you can bury on private
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
ground there are distances from water
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
sources and things like that that have
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
to be taken into account but it really
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
is a rather low impact thing and it's
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
what we used to do for many years and we
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
all know there's a lot we're in new
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
england that's a lot of small private
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
cemeteries all over the place where
 
00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.710 align:start position:0%
cemeteries all over the place where
people

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
were married long be you know long time
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
ago without bombing caskets and all that
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff or maybe a simple pine box
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you very
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
much chair calls anya nickel
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
and please tell this eagle scout uh what
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
is the girl scout equivalent of a gold
 
00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:38.790 align:start position:0%
is the girl scout equivalent of a gold
award

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
award
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
can everybody hear me ah okay
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
so the gold award like you kind of
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned is close to the boy scouts
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
eagle awards
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
it is the highest honor a girl scout can
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
receive and it's supposed to leave a
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
legacy or um
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
yeah a legacy behind after the girl
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
scouts so it's supposed to
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
live past her
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is anya nickel i'm
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
a senior in high school from freedom new
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
hampshire and an ambassador girl scout
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
a few years ago i began researching and
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
learning about green or natural burials
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
without embalming caskets or cement
 
00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:26.949 align:start position:0%
without embalming caskets or cement
vaults

00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
vaults
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
i never imagined that it would leave me
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
here today speaking before you
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
what began as a german class assignment
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
on sustainability with the potential
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
free trip to germany if i won
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
turned into a passion to ensure people
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
have a choice on how they are buried
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
i dove right in determining what was a
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
natural burial and what were the
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
existing new hampshire laws if someone
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to choose such a burial for
 
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.509 align:start position:0%
wanted to choose such a burial for
themselves

00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
i quickly learned that while it is not
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
illegal it was unclear what the statute
 
00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:01.910 align:start position:0%
illegal it was unclear what the statute
was

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
each town
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
had different levels of available
 
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.389 align:start position:0%
had different levels of available
information

00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
many didn't even know what their
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
requirements were and some just referred
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
me back to the state statutes making the
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
whole experience quite like i was going
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
in circles
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
i couldn't imagine being someone in the
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
process of making such an important life
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
decision for oneself and not being able
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
to uncover basic information
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
the one day i was sitting in the freedom
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
village store having tea with my friend
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
who happens to be a non-agenarian and
 
00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
long-time beloved freedom resident
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
my true passion for this topic took hold
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
i was explaining how i had taken on this
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
project and would be heading out to
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
videotape myself and our local cemetery
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
to submit my video for german class and
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
the contest
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
she shared with me her own personal
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
experience with trying to be buried for
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
her beliefs and wants
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
she as a jewish woman wishes to be
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
buried not embalmed in a pine box
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
without a vault
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
she as she put it the sooner i am
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
pushing up daisies the better
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
however she reached out to the selectmen
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
in town after speaking to the cemetery
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
trustees who were not aware of the
 
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
town's requirements
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
she was told she must be buried in a
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
vault she as you can see is quite upset
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
at this as she wants to be buried
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
in her town according to her beliefs
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
when reviewing new hampshire statutes i
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
noticed that one statute about embalming
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
and felt that a bombing should be a
 
00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.389 align:start position:0%
and felt that a bombing should be a
choice

00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
some people would like to avoid all the
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
chemicals used in embalming which are
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
then placed into the ground
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
i didn't win the contest for my german
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
project however i did decide i couldn't
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
stop my work on natural burials as one i
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
learned so much about it and how
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
important it is to so many people and
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
two feel strongly that personal choice
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
is important especially in such a
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
personal manner
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
as i said before i am a girl scout and
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
have been one for nine years the
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
organization teaches us how to be the
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
change in our world
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
so when i decided to continue my work on
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
natural burials i developed a plan of
 
00:14:23.199 --> 00:14:24.230 align:start position:0%
natural burials i developed a plan of
action

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
presented it to the girl scouts gold

it is my hope that this committee will

agree that everyone should have a choice
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
on whether or not they will be involved
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
which will aid in the realization of

approximately 200
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
individuals are licensed funeral
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
director and embalmer
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm here uh here to testify today on
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
behalf of the nhfda members in
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 1320
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
which calls for the repeal of rsa 325
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is one of about 40. there
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
are 39 other states
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
in the united states that have a similar
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
requirement either in statute or in
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
their administrative rules
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
and i do have that that document with me
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
here today
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's a survey that was done
 
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.350 align:start position:0%
it's a survey that was done
nationally

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
nationally
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
and i believe that new hampshire's in
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
fact a leader in the fact that we have
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
it in statute because administrative
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
rules can be changed
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
in comparison to statute relatively
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
easily which statute is a much more as
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
you all know
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
a prolonged and detailed process
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
i also want to mention that there are
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
many funeral directors that were unable
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
to be here this morning that wish to be
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh but they are back at their homes in
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
their communities uh engaged in serving
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
the grieving and uh by caring and caring
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
for the dead
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
i also would like to take a moment just
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
to pause my testimonies i'd be remiss if
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
i did not address a subject
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
which is inevitably connected to the
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
subject of embalming
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that subject is decomposition which
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
is a natural process and the reason i
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
bring this up is because
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
many of us here today
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
have no doubt lost someone close to them
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
someone could be a spouse could be a
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
parent child siblings or family or
 
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.110 align:start position:0%
parent child siblings or family or
friends

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
friends
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
and with this consideration in mind uh
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
as a both from a both personal and
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
professional perspective
 
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.789 align:start position:0%
professional perspective
uh

00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
for the committee members and others in
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
attendance today uh i'm compelled to
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
suggest that this hearing is not the
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate time and place for an
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
experienced or graphic description or uh
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
discussion of decomposition
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh i think i'd be happy to answer those
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
questions in another venue or personally
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing or direct you to to
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
sources if if you're interested in
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
knowing more
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
i do want to point out that
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire according to vital
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
vital records
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
is in 2021 according up into this year
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
there have been approximately 13 860
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
deaths here in new hampshire now a few
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
few thousand more of those were
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
attributed to
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
covid uh
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
but in 2021 as far as i can see from uh
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
from my research that there were 61
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
green barrels
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
so that accounts for you know
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
thousand eight hundred
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh other new hampshire residents uh who
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
have died and they need to be
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
be cared for and that's what our our
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
profession does
 
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.150 align:start position:0%
profession does
um

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
and although we admire you know when we
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
admire and support green burials
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
and have since they were first
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
introduced here in new hampshire we've
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
had a very good relationship with the
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
folks that advocate that and we
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
certainly encourage any families that we
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
work with we help them assist them in
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
any way can with home funerals uh with
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
green barrels i think there's some mis
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation misrepresentation here
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
and i do want to mention to to our uh
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
our civics project uh the young lady who
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
who spoke before me um miss nichol uh
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
that that anything that's i express here
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
today is not personal this is merely our
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
my my position professionally and i
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
admire what she's doing uh i myself was
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
a political science uh major in school
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
and very interested in how the whole
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
process works and so i applaud that i
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
and would certainly be able to you know
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
offer my assistance if there's anything
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
basically with that number of of deaths
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
and there's some confusion about vaults
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
of course which is a cemetery
 
00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:57.669 align:start position:0%
of course which is a cemetery
requirement

00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's entirely a cemetery's decision
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
and the rules and regulations of whether
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
a vault is required or not many
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
cemeteries do have sections where they
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
don't require vaults or they will make
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
exceptions in terms of for religious and
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
and other uh traditions uh that would uh
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
would require a simpler burial such as
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
judaism uh islam and others
 
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
what 325 colon 40-a does is that it
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
offers it's offered for the last 50
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
years um
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
a guidance to the public on
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
the display the public display or or
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
exposure to
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
an unembalmed body
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
for a time period you know longer than
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
24 hours after death
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
and what this guidance really does is
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
that it helps the families make
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
perhaps what could be unfortunate
 
00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:48.470 align:start position:0%
perhaps what could be unfortunate
choices

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
choices
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know given the the unpleasant
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
realities that accompany
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
decomposition which is a natural process
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to get into any more
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
detail at this time it also
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
helps reduce the liability on funeral
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
homes because if we were to provide
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
services that we weren't comfortable
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
with or felt pressured by family
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
the idea of exposure in terms of mental
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
anguish and suffering would be i think
 
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
would be severe
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
and that those that liability on both
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
funeral directors as individuals and as
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
funeral homes as small businesses here
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
now a lot of funeral homes do have
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
refrigeration many don't
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
i know it's been grandfathered and that
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
it would be another be a financial
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
burden on the funeral home to to have to
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
be required to do that
 
00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:36.950 align:start position:0%
be required to do that
um

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
the other concern we have is that the
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
the repeal of this statute
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh is going to have a ripple effect on
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules that receive
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
their authority from this statute and
 
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
there's one in particular about
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
embalming requirements for winter and
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
tumens here in new hampshire
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
many many many cemeteries are closed for
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
the winter they're inaccessible even in
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
good weather they're hard to get to
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
they're small
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
uh and they they require winter and
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
tumen uh so that's another consideration
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh they're those sorts of administrative
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
roles that could be adversely affected
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
by this and and i really think the
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
statute the way it is and yeah it is
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
i think it could be clearly more clearly
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
written but that's my opinion
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh and that uh it does help protect both
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
the physical the the mental and
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
emotional well-being of of our our
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
friends and neighbors
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
and also i think in closing i just want
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
to thank you all for your
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
your service and and your time and
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
consideration i'd be happy to try to
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you have
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.710 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
weber

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for taking my question
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh i guess my question is just as
 
00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:54.390 align:start position:0%
uh i guess my question is just as
currently

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
we have people who
 
00:22:57.919 --> 00:22:59.270 align:start position:0%
we have people who
choose

00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
choose
 
00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.789 align:start position:0%
choose
to

00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
follow various different practices
 
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.390 align:start position:0%
follow various different practices
and

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
with varying degrees of difficulty
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be possible even in the
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
absence of the statute on embalming and
 
00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.110 align:start position:0%
absence of the statute on embalming and
viewing

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
viewing
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
for any funeral director or embalmer to
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
set for their own practice whatever
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
standards they believe are
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
correct and proper and necessary for the
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances the weather and everything
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
else and let me say just as an aside
 
00:23:27.919 --> 00:23:28.710 align:start position:0%
else and let me say just as an aside
that

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
those of us who've lived through the
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
resume debates before have no
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.669 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:37.679 --> 00:23:39.110 align:start position:0%
but
but

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that be a matter for
 
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.909 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that be a matter for
individual

00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
preferences and practices and an
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
evaluation on
 
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to each individual
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
circumstances my question
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
given that the circumstances are very
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
different say winter to summer and
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise and family situations are very
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
different right thank you that's a very
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
good question uh representative weber um
 
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.710 align:start position:0%
good question uh representative weber um
what's

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
what's
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
already i think one of the
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
misconceptions here is that
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
the public actually already has choices
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
to they have the opportunity to make it
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
whatever choices they want to make the
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
only requirements would be if it were an
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
open casket viewing to the public you
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
know several days after death the
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
funeral home would require embalming uh
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's here in the statute but also i
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
think personally they would
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
they they do have there is a
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
federal trade commission regulation
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
which is federal regulation which does
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
allow funeral homes to set their own
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
their own requirements for what services
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
they provide that will
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
require embalming but the public
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
actually has the option to have other
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
services whether it be a closed casket
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
many cases that's the case
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
close gasket if they choose cremation
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
whether they have services or not
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
and it's i think my in response to your
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
question more detail is that
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to
 
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.630 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to
predict

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
predict
 
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.669 align:start position:0%
predict
how

00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
each individual
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
body is going to to respond and for me
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
even even with refrigeration which is
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
only a temporary measure does not
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
replace the
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
level of preservation that we get from
 
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.590 align:start position:0%
level of preservation that we get from
embalming

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
embalming
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
and even under refrigeration the process
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
will of decomposition continues
 
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
and to know what
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
state that body may be in and three or
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
four five days from now uh it would be
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
impossible for me to determine
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
and uh i think it's i think again it's
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to traumatize them we want to
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
make things you know unpleasant for them
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
they're already going through enough as
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if that's answered your
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
question or not
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any further questions
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh just a question
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
about how you read the current statute
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
which seems to me a little odd
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
no dead human body shall be exposed to
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
the public for a period in excess of 24
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
hours unless
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
um if i um
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
say i die and i'm
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
at your facility for five days
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
and there's a wake and the fifth day and
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
people come for an interval of four
 
00:26:24.799 --> 00:26:26.230 align:start position:0%
people come for an interval of four
hours

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.350 align:start position:0%
hours
um

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
and then go home
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
could they come again the following
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
tuesday for another week for another
 
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
four hours
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh at which point that would be nine
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
days post death
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
because the way it's worded it says no
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
dead body shall be exposed to the pub to
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
in excess of 24 hours in other words i
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
presume that's cumulative so it seems
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
like this is worded kind of strangely it
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
how do you interpret that well thank you
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
you are correct um that there's um
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
when i look at what i see as the spirit
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
of the law or i think it's the intent
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
the intention is the the intent is that
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
that a dead human body would not be
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
exposed to the public
 
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.630 align:start position:0%
exposed to the public
um

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
after they've been dead for more than 24
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
hours from the time of death that's the
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
way that the clarification that's the
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
way i believe it should be
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's it is uh it is confusing uh it is
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
not a cumulative time amount of the of
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
the viewings and so forth and that if
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
the body were embalmed and you had a
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
viewing had a calling hours on friday
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
and then you wanted to do it again
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
sunday or monday you could definitely of
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
course you could do that yeah
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
your comment about it uh interpreted to
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
a a particular family that comes in and
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
you say well you're not gonna have this
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh for two day uh awake for two days
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
then do you tell them that no it has to
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
be involved the law requires it to be
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
embalmed within 24 hours is that how you
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
present that not embalmed within 24
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
hours but embalmed if he the person the
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
individual is going to be uh exposed to
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
the public after the 24 hours from the
 
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
time of death thank you
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
being here and taking our questions
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
um i see that the rulemaking authority
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
actually is in 325.9 so that would
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
remain and there would be the ethical
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
and professional standards so my
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
question is if right now the faith
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
communities judaism and islam
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
if right now they are limited from
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
having open casket viewings if they are
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
not involving the bodies and if this
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
might be something where certain subsets
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
of the of the professional community
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
might adopt this but everybody else
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
might stay with what's currently in
 
00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.470 align:start position:0%
might stay with what's currently in
statute

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative for your
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
question uh in both of those traditions
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh they strictly forbid
 
00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:01.909 align:start position:0%
uh they strictly forbid
uh

00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
a viewing of the body the body is in a
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
closed container on aaron in the jewish
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
tradition but even in the in his islam
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh they are not exposed to they're not
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh viewable or exposed to the public in
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
any way as part in terms of like
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
conservative judaism uh
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
that that is the case there so it
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect them anyway they would
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
not they would not be embalmed to start
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
with because of their religious uh
 
00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:27.990 align:start position:0%
with because of their religious uh
traditions

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
traditions
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
or law thank you i just wanted to make
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
sure to protect uh traditions i don't
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
know quite as well as i agree and we
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
serve all of those communities and and
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
and uh so yeah there is that right
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr morton for taking my call
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
would this bill
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
limit in any way
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
what a funeral home could share with the
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
family about the potential issues with
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
displaying a body for longer than 24
 
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.070 align:start position:0%
displaying a body for longer than 24
hours

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
if i understand your question
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative kennedy would it prohib
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
prevent us from explaining that right uh
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
no of course it wouldn't um i personally
 
00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:14.630 align:start position:0%
no of course it wouldn't um i personally
um

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
as i said i know now that everyone is
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
has the experience of representative
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
weber from the resume
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
hearings years ago
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
it would be it's it's also a
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
conversation that i you know do have on
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
occasion it's not a regular one i have
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
with families uh but you know i'm always
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
very very very guarded in how i explain
 
00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:35.269 align:start position:0%
very very very guarded in how i explain
that

00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
and that uh
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
what you know the need for that and
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
having having a statute that says we
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
have this requirement
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
is helpful in that respect
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's really i've never had a family
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
argue or ask
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
when they understand that well i can't
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
really guarantee
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
what your loved one's going to look like
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
and i really can't
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
can't do that and and frankly i wouldn't
 
00:30:57.039 --> 00:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
can't do that and and frankly i wouldn't
really

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't want to
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
um and that's it would expose me a
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
am i can you hear me now yes
 
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.630 align:start position:0%
am i can you hear me now yes
okay

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.509 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:26.710 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
i do believe there are certain buddhist
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
traditions which um
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
do have um viewings of a body or sitting
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
with the body for um an extensive period
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
of time after death and i was just
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
wondering and i apologize if this was
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
covered i did come in late
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
um if the statute as it's written
 
00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:47.029 align:start position:0%
um if the statute as it's written
currently

00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
does it only apply to viewings in
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
funeral homes or
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
if these viewings are done
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in a place of worship or in a
 
00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.710 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in a place of worship or in a
home

00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
does the statute still apply
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
well i don't know if i'm qualified to
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
make that that uh that distinction uh in
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
terms of the interpretation of the
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
statute i i've had a i've done buddhist
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
services with just the situation which
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
you have you have described where the
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
individual uh who was from tibet uh he'd
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
been under hospice care he remained at
 
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.630 align:start position:0%
been under hospice care he remained at
home

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
after his death
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
and the monks from a local temple came
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
for three days to pray uh as we all went
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
what i think
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
in a case like that uh what the family
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
chooses and in that is it's
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
again i don't regard would regard that
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
as being exposed to the public that
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
would be more of what i would think i
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
would interpret as a private service we
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
have home bear we have home funerals
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
where people might use dry ice or other
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
means uh
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
again i'm not the i'm not the embalming
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
police here this is not i think this may
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
be more towards like those public what i
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
would consider a public venue thank you
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
how's that perfect
 
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
the red button
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
um if the family wanted to have a
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
natural funeral but they could not get
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
their family all together
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
in 24 hours
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
would refrigeration function okay
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
if it was uh 48 or 72 hours in your
 
00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.870 align:start position:0%
if it was uh 48 or 72 hours in your
experience

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative for your
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
question um again that's
 
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
every every case every
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
individual that we care for that's in in
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
our care uh
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
it has a potential being a different
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
very indifferent scenario there are
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
different considerations in terms of the
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
cause of death
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
the size weight of the individual
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
they're things that can can affect
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh how well that would work and so it's
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
a very it's hard fart for me to
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
determine whether
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
now are you talking about a service at
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
the funeral home right now or is it this
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
being their own home or
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
funeral home
 
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.829 align:start position:0%
funeral home
uh

00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:25.839 --> 00:34:27.109 align:start position:0%
uh
i

00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
i can answer this personally i can't
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
answer for every funeral director i i
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
would be more comfortable if they were
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
involved if it was going to be three or
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
four days later yeah
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
i'm still trying to under learn the law
 
00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:47.430 align:start position:0%
i'm still trying to under learn the law
so

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
is it okay
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
to have a closed if you had a casket
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
could you have a closed casket
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
is this 24 hour limit currently
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
just for an open casket or does it apply
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
to closed too
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct it is only
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
applies to like a public viewing an open
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
casket both of my parents their wish was
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
would not was not to be embalmed to have
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
no public viewing we did have calling
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
hours with a closed casket there are
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
other means of of things that in
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
preparation that can be done but they're
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know they're in a closed casket so
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
they're not exposed to the public uh and
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
other precautions are taken and i
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
respected their wishes and uh you know
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%

just to have a nice

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
acronym
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
at a family barbecue a few years ago i
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
was the one getting the grilling about
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
home funerals and green burials from my
 
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.109 align:start position:0%

aunt

who lost her husband a couple of years
 
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.910 align:start position:0%
who lost her husband a couple of years
before

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
when i explained the new hampshire
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
embalming law to her she was devastated
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
to learn that my uncle needn't have been
 
00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.870 align:start position:0%
to learn that my uncle needn't have been
embalmed

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
embalmed
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
i didn't want that she told me but they
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
said we had to
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
that it was the law
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
over the past 15 years leading new
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire free and several other related
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
national nonprofits
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
i've heard countless similar stories
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
first hand from people accompanied by
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
tears of anger and guilt
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
and panic about how they'll pay for it
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
and i've spoken with many conscientious
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire funeral directors who are
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
well aware that this law does not
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
require embalming 24 hours after a death
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
it's common misinterpretation
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
at issue here is the difference between
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
business policy and the law
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
most funeral businesses have in-house
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
policies that require embalming before
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
public viewings that last any period of
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
time and that's perfectly within their
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
rights as business owners
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
quote it's our policy to require
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
embalming if a body is to be held in our
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
facility for over 48 hours and quote
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
appears on several new hampshire funeral
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
price lists
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
but this bill isn't about a business
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
policy it's about a law
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
and the law says that proper embalming
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
is only required in the event that a
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
body is going to be exposed to the
 
00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.349 align:start position:0%
body is going to be exposed to the
public

00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
in excess of 24 hours
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
the law doesn't say what constitutes a
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
proper embalming or anything about the
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
time from death to the procedure it only
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
states the public viewing period
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
and still you'll find some new hampshire

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
some forms of embalming laws do exist in
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
other states in fact 14 states have some
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
wording that requires either embalming
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
or refrigeration after a certain number
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
of days
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
about half of the states don't mention
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
in the law embalming whatsoever
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire stands alone in requiring
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
embalming for a day and night long

00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%

embalming fluid manufacturer recently
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
confirmed to me that the preservative

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
two weeks
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
what then is preserving the bodies in

the winter
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
it's the cold
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law doesn't mention
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%

natural burials that don't allow
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
embalming including those for jews
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%

winter in new hampshire municipal
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
cemeteries rests solely with our elected
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
trustees who write and enforce each

town's cemetery bylaws
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
their choice to limit burial in winter
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
is not a good enough reason to limit new
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%

one more observation
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law confers full custody
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
and control of a dead body to the next
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
of kin in rsa29017
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
can this be true if another law takes
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
that control out of their hands
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
to take it a step further some might
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
also consider the state compelling its
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
citizens to pay for
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
to pay for a family member to undergo
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
embalming for any reason
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
and infringement on their family privacy
 
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.670 align:start position:0%
and infringement on their family privacy
rights

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
leaving this law in the books keeps the
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
door open for continued
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation that has already led
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
to the limiting of personal choice and
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
created immeasurable financial and
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
emotional hardship for some new
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
removing it will not affect the rights
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
of funeral professionals to offer or
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
even require embalming in their place of
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
business but it will provide clearer
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
choice for consumers and the families
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
being served
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
miss webster would you take questions
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:27.990 align:start position:0%
i know that i'm trying not to say doctor
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:30.630 align:start position:0%
i know that i'm trying not to say doctor

representative
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question um
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
have you experienced through your work
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
with free
 
00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.510 align:start position:0%
with free
that

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
family members find the cost of
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
embalming to be a
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
burden a financial burden
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that i
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
frequently receive calls from new
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire people who are
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
looking for a way to be able to afford
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
all of it
 
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:03.829 align:start position:0%
all of it
but

00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
that is a particular concern for them
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
often because they've been told that
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's required
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of what their other plans are
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
so i would say
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes it's a hardship
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and uh miss
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
mr morin you had handouts did we get
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
them did you pass them around
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
the chair uh now recognizes
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to do it the way i was
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
taught in a new england mill town
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
am i right on conway
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's the old french way we've
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
anglicized it a bit uh mark conoyer
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
but uh thank you thank you
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
i'm a fellow uh eagle scout as well and
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
i appreciate
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
but again i'm here a
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
30-year funeral director and obama here
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
i did submit my
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
testimony in writing uh last evening
 
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.670 align:start position:0%
testimony in writing uh last evening
and

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
i would like to make myself available to
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
answer any questions uh pertaining to
 
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.270 align:start position:0%
answer any questions uh pertaining to
that

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
i uh i do want to state very clearly
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
we're here
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
i'm here in opposition of the bill
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
there is a a common misunderstanding
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
that embalming is is required
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
um it is not it is
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
it is uh very infrequently uh not
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
required but there are always
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
instances that arise that do
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
it is the best practice or best choice
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
of care
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
to help satisfy a family's request
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
to take the requirement out of the rsa
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh a family to decline what might be the
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
most appropriate approach to
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
satisfying their requests
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
um so that that's my concern and and you
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of of removing
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
it entirely rewriting or amending
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
the bill to be clearer for the public
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
would be wonderful but um to eliminate
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
that that requirement is a concern
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you sir i've been
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
ordained for 47 years so i have been
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
part of at least 200 funerals in that
 
00:44:48.839 --> 00:44:50.470 align:start position:0%
part of at least 200 funerals in that
capacity

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
and probably about a third of them i
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
accompanied the family in their initial
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
visit to the funeral home
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
i don't ever recall a funeral director
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
saying that there were a variety of
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
choices such as green burial or these
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
things only once did a family ask and
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
they were very quickly talked out of it
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
with an intention
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that's you i'm not saying
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
that's new hampshire i've not i've only
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
done a handful of funerals in new
 
00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.150 align:start position:0%
done a handful of funerals in new
hampshire

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
but i am saying that it is not my
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
experience that
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
funeral directors as a rule present
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
anything other than what is their
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
so my question is would you believe that
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
my experience
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
even though it's considerable is an
 
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.309 align:start position:0%
even though it's considerable is an
outlier

00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
outlier
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question i would
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
feel that way i i the the funeral
 
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.349 align:start position:0%
feel that way i i the the funeral
directors

00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
directors
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
and and figured me for not saying before
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
i i have served on the ex
 
00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:55.109 align:start position:0%
i i have served on the ex
the

00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire funeral directors
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
association i've also served nationally
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
with national funeral directors
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
association as a liaison between new
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the national
 
00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.630 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the national
um

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
i would think that's a rarity the the
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
funeral director is
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
that i'm much more familiar with
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
have always been upfront with families
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
regarding choices
 
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.349 align:start position:0%
regarding choices
personally

00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
personally
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
even though alkaline hydrolysis is not
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
allowed here in new hampshire i've even
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
helped families acquire those services
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
in maine
 
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:29.990 align:start position:0%
in maine
so

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
most funeral homes most funeral
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
more of a concierge in trying to meet
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
anyone's request
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
instead of declining uh any any part of
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
care for any reason
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
that was only my follow-up is that was
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
only in one occasion
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
that it was lobbied against the most the
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
rest of the time it wasn't mentioned at
 
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.829 align:start position:0%
rest of the time it wasn't mentioned at
all

00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
so anyway representative weber
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:04.309 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
taking

00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it's
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
awfully hard when you can't see people's
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of interested in following up
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
on your statement if i understood it
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
correctly about
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
taking this out of the statute might
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
interfere with a family's
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
most appropriate way of
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
honoring their
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
decedent's wishes and
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out how
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
taking this out of the statute would in
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
any way
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
interfere with the family's desires
 
00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:39.990 align:start position:0%
interfere with the family's desires
because

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
clearly if a family wants embalming
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
they may have embalming
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
clearly if a family wants a viewing a
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
number of days in the future so that
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
others can get there
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
that is a discussion that must be had
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
with the funeral
 
00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.670 align:start position:0%
with the funeral
uh

00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.790 align:start position:0%
uh
home

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
about what
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
what is appropriate and what is not
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate and what what their choices
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
are under those circumstances but i
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
don't see how reviewing
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
how repealing the statute could in any
 
00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.790 align:start position:0%
how repealing the statute could in any
way

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
interfere with the family
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
making the most important choices
 
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily interfere thank you
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
for your question it wouldn't
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily interfere with their their
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
choices i i
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it would interfere with
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
their choices it would be
 
00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.309 align:start position:0%
their choices it would be
um

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
like in the case of of organ donation or
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
autopsies the you know the organ bank is
 
00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.630 align:start position:0%
autopsies the you know the organ bank is
that

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
organ donation is such a great gift of
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
life um and they
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
do share with each each donor's family
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
that they can see their loved one again
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
after that process
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
and if they're able to
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
you know decline uh if it's not a
 
00:48:56.079 --> 00:48:57.190 align:start position:0%
you know decline uh if it's not a
requirement

00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
in in any way shape or form
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
if they're able to decline
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
that type of care after a donation
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
just for an example
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be a very pleasant
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
goodbye for that family
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
that that's i don't know if that would
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
that would be a good discussion to have
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
with a family regarding
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know the good and bad of of seeing
 
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:23.829 align:start position:0%
you know the good and bad of of seeing
someone

00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
after any type of death and
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
it should be a careful discussion held
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
and it's on us as funeral directors to
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh the families take their time in any
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
choice that's made
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
i think without having that as a
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know as something to fall back on as
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
a requirement if absolutely needed
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
is my concern more than
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:49:53.599 --> 00:49:57.190 align:start position:0%
anything else
follow-up

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
but is there anything that stops you as
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
a funeral director from saying that is
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
i understand i understand that these are
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
very difficult times and very delicate
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
negotiations and i have been
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
certainly been part of them on a number
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
of occasions
 
00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.630 align:start position:0%
of occasions
but

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
isn't what families are asking for at
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
this time
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
just a straight answer and straight
 
00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.349 align:start position:0%
just a straight answer and straight
information

00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
on what
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
on all the consequences of their choices
 
00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.270 align:start position:0%
on all the consequences of their choices
because

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
i do understand that people come to
 
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
this process the first time
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
with a lot of misconceptions and
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings and
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
is isn't that the basis of what your
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
profession is providing
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
kindly guiding through those choices
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
and the consequences
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
pleasant or unpleasant of any choice
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
they might make
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
it it is and it is on us to
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
be very
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
clear in answering their questions
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
but in a gentle way it's not on the
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
funeral director to say no to a request
 
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.470 align:start position:0%
funeral director to say no to a request
without

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
you know very carefully
 
00:51:20.319 --> 00:51:21.510 align:start position:0%
you know very carefully
reviewing

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
reviewing
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
all that's involved right and just just
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
one final very quick follow-up if you
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
may but it's certainly in the purview of
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
a funeral director to say
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh the choice you are making i believe
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
is a hazard to me and to my employees
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
and we simply can't
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
help you in that respect
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
is that not true i mean i know that
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
that's not something you want to do but
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
you have that option do you not
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
we do we have the option of not helping
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
the medical examiner we have the option
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
of of all of this but
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's not an option that any of us are
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
i saw another hand
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
waving off okay thank you sir appreciate
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
the chair calls up susan hopkins new
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire state board of funeral
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
directors and
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
it's abbreviated but i'm going to stick
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
a stab at it it's embalmers that is
 
00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:32.309 align:start position:0%
a stab at it it's embalmers that is
correct

00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning chairman
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
pearson and members of the committee my
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
name is susan hopkins and i've been a
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
licensed funeral director and the ant
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
obama in the state of new hampshire for
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
the past 20 years i own a business in
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
salem and i am a current member of the
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state board of funeral
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
directors and embalmers
 
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
i do want to state that no
 
00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.750 align:start position:0%
i do want to state that no
state

00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
currently requires embalming of every
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
the state board of funeral directors and
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
obamas are opposed to
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
to changing the embalming statute
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
rsa 325 40a
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
we don't know how the repeal of this
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
statute would impact the administrative
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
rules and the legacy of funeral service
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
funeral service has not changed much in
 
00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.790 align:start position:0%
funeral service has not changed much in
decades

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
decades
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
and embalming remains the only way to
 
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
temporarily preserve a deceased person
 
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
for viewing
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
embalming doesn't stop a deceased person
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
from returning to their natural state it
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
only slows down the process
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
embalming sanitizes
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
and temporarily preserves a deceased
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
person to allow family members and
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
friends the opportunity to have a
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
private or public viewing if they choose
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
embalming is not mandatory
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
and currently is not required if the
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
family chooses
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
a service with a closed casket or
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
cremation prior to any funeral services
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
there has been some discussion about
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
green burial
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i can't speak to every town but in
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
the town of salem
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
there is no cemetery that would allow
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
green burials
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
there is also
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
in salem
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
no cemetery
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
that would allow
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
a jewish person to be buried in
 
00:54:43.599 --> 00:54:44.470 align:start position:0%
a jewish person to be buried in
their

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
faith tradition
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
but there are certainly
 
00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:49.750 align:start position:0%
but there are certainly
other

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
mostly jewish cemeteries or
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
other cemeteries of faith tradition
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
where people can have
 
00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.190 align:start position:0%
where people can have
their

00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
loved ones buried in their faith
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
tradition that they would
 
00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:07.270 align:start position:0%
tradition that they would
like

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
for me personally the biggest issues are
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
public safety around the natural
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
decomposition process
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
and the mental health of families that
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
we are honored to
 
00:55:18.839 --> 00:55:20.390 align:start position:0%
we are honored to
serve

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
serve
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
i am about to give a graphic explanation
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
of what happens when someone passes away
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
but i think it's important for you to
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
understand the process and it's
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
necessary to understand the consequence
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
of repealing this legislation
 
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
when a person passes away
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
decomposition begins within several
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
minutes with a process called itolysis
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
or self-digestion
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
chemical reactions occur
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
enzymes digest cell walls
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
tissues and organs break down
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
discoloration occurs
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
rigor mortis sets in
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
bacteria spreads throughout the body
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
gases build up and the pressure causes
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
fluids to leak out
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
this happens at different intervals
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
we do not want to traumatize families if
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
they witness any consequence of the
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
decomposition process
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
embalming is currently the only way to
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
delay this process
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
most funeral homes and nursing homes do
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
not have refrigeration
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
and many hospitals have very small
 
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.230 align:start position:0%
and many hospitals have very small
morgues

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
morgues
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
refrigeration does not prohibit the
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
chemical reactions from occurring
 
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
the same way that embalming does
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
often when death occurs in
 
00:56:48.079 --> 00:56:49.270 align:start position:0%
often when death occurs in
suddenly

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
suddenly
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
in a hospital or nursing home
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
family and friends may have minimal
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
contact with them
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
due to the current pandemic it is not in
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the public to view
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
people that have died of covet 19
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
without their being embalmed
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
families may not have been able to visit
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
with their loved ones in their last days
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
because they are in isolation
 
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
it is difficult to place a value on
 
00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.670 align:start position:0%
it is difficult to place a value on
comfort

00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
comfort
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
it is a treasured gift for families to
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
safely have the opportunity to say
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
goodbye to their loved ones
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
families are often relieved to see their
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
loved ones at peace
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
this also happens
 
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
helps with the grieving process
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
and when i personally meet with the
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
family i ask them
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
what type of service they are interested
 
00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.630 align:start position:0%
what type of service they are interested
in

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.230 align:start position:0%
in
and

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
many times embalming is not involved and
 
00:57:50.799 --> 00:57:51.589 align:start position:0%
many times embalming is not involved and
that

00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
every family should have what they want
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
and we do need to have discussions
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
about what families would choose
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
these are just a few of the reasons that
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
i urge you to find house bill 1320 in
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate thank you thank
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
you miss hopkins are there any questions
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
taking this question i'm trying to

you know trying to be delicate and we
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
would have to have that discussion with

01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um and i'm sure that
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
in my experience
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
funeral directors
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
that i have dealt with have been i'm
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
very skilled and very sensitive about
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
having these discussions at a time when
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely necessary and i
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
i still didn't understand whether the
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
consequence that we're talking about
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
is a health consequence
 
01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.990 align:start position:0%
is a health consequence
or

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
or an issue of trauma
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
well unfortunately
 
01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:55.430 align:start position:0%
well unfortunately
we

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
certain causes are put on the death
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
certificate but that
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't always state everything that the
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
person died of
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
and with the current pandemic the rules
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
keep changing about what is safe and
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
what isn't safe
 
01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.750 align:start position:0%
what isn't safe
and

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
we can't say for sure
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
we don't always know what sort of
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
medications chemotherapy
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
the half-life all of that
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
we are not aware of all of that so i'm
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
not trying to avoid the question but i
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
just don't have the medical
 
01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.109 align:start position:0%
just don't have the medical
background

01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
background
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
and we're not informed with all of the
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
medications that were put into
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
their bodies prior to us having them in
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
our funeral homes
 
01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.270 align:start position:0%
our funeral homes
and

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:55.990 align:start position:0%
and
and

01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:57.789 --> 01:01:57.799 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
autopsies and organ donation
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
that would be more of um a traumatic
 
01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.589 align:start position:0%
that would be more of um a traumatic
experience

01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you over this side of the
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
playground yes representative cushman
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand um you said it
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a good situation
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
unembalmed viewing
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
after an autopsy or an organ donation
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned um
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.190 align:start position:0%
you know
that

01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
there may be some issue of trauma in
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:02:38.799 --> 01:02:39.910 align:start position:0%
your testimony
and

01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
i i'm wondering
 
01:02:41.359 --> 01:02:42.470 align:start position:0%
i i'm wondering
um

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.510 align:start position:0%
um
why

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
why we should continue to not allow
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
there to be a choice because i consider
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
that some families may be traumatized by
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
not having the option of having a
 
01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.549 align:start position:0%
not having the option of having a
viewing

01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
viewing
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
in any situation
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
and you know and many are willing to
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
face the reality of death whether it's
 
01:03:02.559 --> 01:03:03.829 align:start position:0%
face the reality of death whether it's
after

01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
an autopsy or an organ donation or an
 
01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.190 align:start position:0%
an autopsy or an organ donation or an
accident

01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
accident
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
many are willing to face that and many
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
just want to honor their loved ones
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
wishes and
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
removing the ability to choose would
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i mean i i don't want to
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
get too graphic but when
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.359 --> 01:03:38.230 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
they do
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
have their organs removed including
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
their brain
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
and there is
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
multiple there are multiple incisions on
 
01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:50.150 align:start position:0%
multiple there are multiple incisions on
their

01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
head as well as their body
 
01:03:53.039 --> 01:03:55.029 align:start position:0%
head as well as their body
that

01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
with the embalming process it's easier
 
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
to hide that incision
 
01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.390 align:start position:0%
to hide that incision
[Music]

01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
families do have that opportunity within
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
the 24 hours
 
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:08.950 align:start position:0%
the 24 hours
but

01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
that would be a delicate discussion
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
because we certainly
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
want to help families move forward
 
01:04:16.559 --> 01:04:17.510 align:start position:0%
want to help families move forward
and

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%

01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
hopkins for coming um just a very quick
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
question it's a follow-up to
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro's question which
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
i think is quite incisive
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
um he asked whether we were dealing with
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
issues of grief or issues of public
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
health were you practicing at the time
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
that we got the first ebola cases that
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
came to this country or
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
sudden acute respiratory syndrome sars
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
and did you get directives from the
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
department of public health or any other
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
agency on how to potentially deal with
 
01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.430 align:start position:0%
agency on how to potentially deal with
um

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
bodies that had died of these causes
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
we do get some directives
 
01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.750 align:start position:0%
we do get some directives
but

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
things change as information becomes
 
01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.670 align:start position:0%
things change as information becomes
aware

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
aware
 
01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.950 align:start position:0%
aware
and

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
that's the difficult position that
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
funeral directors would be in just
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
looking at the recent covet pandemic all
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
of the changes that have been made
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
we want to keep everyone safe and there
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
are options to do that currently
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
good okay and we're going to have to
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
really pick up speed as we come to close
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
here so just one question with no
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up please okay
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
um how long excuse me how long would you
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
and could you choose not to offer the
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
service if someone said i'd like a
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
viewing with an un my unembalmed family
 
01:06:01.029 --> 01:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
member but i'd like it in two days or
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
three days
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
would you have the right simply to say
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
we don't do that
 
01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.670 align:start position:0%
we don't do that
we

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
would be able to have that right and as
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
peter morin previously stated
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
there isn't an exact science about how
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
decomposition occurs
 
01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.670 align:start position:0%
decomposition occurs
it

01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
it's a variety of factors that
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
we don't have time to go into today
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you uh so much for
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
coming thank you for your time the last
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
pink cut i have is from josh slocum from
 
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
funeral consumers alliance is a
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
non-profit educational organization
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
think of us like we were consumer
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
reports magazine but focused only on the
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
end-of-life transaction
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
um i'll go quickly through my testimony
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
but i did want to offer a correction to
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
what i think are some misunderstandings
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
that were introduced earlier
 
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
it is not the case that 39 other states
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
have a law on their books that requires
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
embalming for viewing a body
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
i know this because i am the co-author
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
of a book called final rights which is a
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
compendium of state laws all 50 states
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
in the district
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
on funeral and burial law written from a
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
consumer perspective new hampshire is
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
the only state i am aware of in updating
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
this research that has a law that claims
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
that embalming is necessary in a period
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
in excess of 24 hours
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
i would also like to state it is simply
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
not the case that this is a public
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
health issue the centers for disease
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
control the world health organization
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
the pan-american health organization
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
have all repeatedly
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
clearly stated
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
that simply viewing an unembalmed body
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
is not a public health problem we are
 
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
all viewing each other right now in this
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
room this is a mass viewing
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
we are not worried that because we are
 
01:08:00.319 --> 01:08:01.910 align:start position:0%
we are not worried that because we are
unembalmed

01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
unembalmed
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
that we are going to be a danger to each
 
01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.549 align:start position:0%
that we are going to be a danger to each
other

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
hb 1320 is about freedom of choice this
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
bill would remove new hampshire's unique
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement that anybody
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
displayed to the public in excess of 24
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
hours be embalmed
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
as others have noted the statute is
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
confusingly written when you read it
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
you're not sure if it means one of two
 
01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
very different things number one
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
once 24 hours has passed since death any
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
body that is going to be looked at has
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
to be embalmed or number two
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
anybody embalmed excuse me anybody
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
viewed by the public for a cumulative
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
duration of more than 24 hours must be
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
embalmed we cannot tell from the
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
statutory language
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
this ambiguity has led to some new
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire funeral homes stating that
 
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
embalming is required by law in order
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
for the family to view the body if it
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
takes place more than a day after death
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
since it is practically impossible to
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
organize a viewing within 24 hours of
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
death for most families these families
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
are forced to pay for a process that
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
they may not want and they may not be
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
able to afford and i'd like to
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
highlight here
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
it is not uncommon to see a price tag of
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
between 700 and 1200 dollars for
 
01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.990 align:start position:0%
between 700 and 1200 dollars for
embalming

01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
embalming
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
i don't know how everyone else in this
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
room is fixed financially but for a lot
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
of families that's quite a significant
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
outlay of cash
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
we think this is not an acceptable
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
situation the choice of embalming should
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
remain a personal one and we don't
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
believe that the state has a legitimate
 
01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.390 align:start position:0%
believe that the state has a legitimate
interest

01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
in compelling families to choose a
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
process and to pay for it
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
that they may not want that they may
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
find unnecessary invasive or contrary to
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
embalming is a cosmetic procedure whose
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
effects last in general about two weeks
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
and it's important to remember that this
 
01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.270 align:start position:0%
and it's important to remember that this
process

01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
was developed during an age when the
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
idea of miasmas or smelly air
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
was believed to be the chief cause of
 
01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.270 align:start position:0%
was believed to be the chief cause of
illness

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
illness
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
when this law in new hampshire was
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
enacted in 1971 germ theory was well
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
established but this particular point
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
was not as well understood
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
50 years later we know that corpses are
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
almost never a source of disease
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
transmission certainly not to those who
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
are merely viewing the body
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
half the states do have laws that speak
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
to embalming or refrigeration they
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
include this choice
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
none require it as a matter of course
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
hb 1320 would simply restore this choice
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
to families where we believe it should
 
01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.310 align:start position:0%
to families where we believe it should
be

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
the bill does not take away any options
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
from any party to this transaction it
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
does not bar funeral homes from
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
requiring embalming if they choose for a
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
public viewing
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
most funeral homes already do make this
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
choice we're not asking the state to
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
stop funeral homes from setting their
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
own policies we are asking the state to
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
remove a confusingly written law that
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
has been misused by a minority of
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
funeral homes to compel a purchase that
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
some families don't want to make there
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
are times when embalming is the most
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
practical choice and if it's desired by
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
the family they should have that choice
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
but there are other options such as cold
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
storage or mechanical refrigeration that
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
solve problems having to do with
 
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.189 align:start position:0%
solve problems having to do with
preservation

01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
preservation
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
no funeral home and no family in new
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire will be bereft of options
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
if this law is passed and i thank you
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot of work with end of
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
life decisions
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
in fact i just did that with my will
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to me we're hearing about
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
the decisions of
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
those who are still alive instead of the
 
01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.790 align:start position:0%
those who are still alive instead of the
decisions

01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
about the person that's dying
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
and that i would prefer and i'm getting
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
close to
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
because of my age to be thinking about
 
01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.669 align:start position:0%
because of my age to be thinking about
this

01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
i would like to have some say in
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
that funeral
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
or the whole process
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
so i did go to my local
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
funeral homes of
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
people that i've known for
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
a long time but seemed to me they were
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
mostly talking about money
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
and that i should get insurance and
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
raise eight thousand dollars so nobody
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
has to take that burden
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
but i didn't have much information about
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
my decision about what i want
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
done at that funeral
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts about that
 
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
and maybe
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
that should be included
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
in the legislation
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
well i'd actually i think there are ways
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
for people to have um influence over
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
what funeral choices are carried out
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
after their death
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think that's probably something better
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
addressed in a separate conversation
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
because i don't believe that
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it's something this bill
 
01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
could could practically address
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
but if you'd like to give funeral
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
consumers alliance a call you and i can
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
talk about that i'm happy to help anyone
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um this card just
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
they should come earlier
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
and i will accept no further pink cards
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
david bryant you asked for three minutes
 
01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
i will allow you three minutes
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
representing bryant funeral homes and
 
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:52.630 align:start position:0%
representing bryant funeral homes and
crematory

01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
not just a nudge
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.830 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
um

01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
very briefly
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
came down from coast county this morning
 
01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.669 align:start position:0%
came down from coast county this morning
but

01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
families have choices now i really don't
 
01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.430 align:start position:0%
families have choices now i really don't
believe

01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
that this regulation prevents people
 
01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.990 align:start position:0%
that this regulation prevents people
from

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
having what they want if they make an
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
educated decision and i think by
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
educating yourselves
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
ahead of time that's the best way to go
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
about making these decisions of course
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
we all know that deaths occur
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly and in tragic circumstances
 
01:14:28.719 --> 01:14:29.750 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly and in tragic circumstances
but

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
education in advance my personal opinion
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
is by far the
 
01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
is by far the
best

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
way to go
 
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of the young guy in the room
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
i'm 28 so i'm one of the younger funeral
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
directors in our state
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm not opposed to having a
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
conversation with people when they come
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
into our facility about what they want
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
and generally it's how i start every
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
conversation what do you want
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
what is it that you're looking for how
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
can i help you
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
i understand probably other funeral
 
01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
directors may not do that i think the
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
vast majority do
 
01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.870 align:start position:0%
vast majority do
embalming

01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
embalming
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
the sole
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
complication with green burials the
 
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
green burial council does have embalming
 
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
chemicals that are certified their
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
national nonprofit organization
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
that they allow
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
for the embalming process to take place
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
and to for the person to be buried in a
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
green burial uh environment
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
um so i think embalming
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily preclude someone
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
from being buried in a green environment
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
i think they just need to be educated go
 
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
about it the right way there are a lot
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
of other regulations such as the
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
cemeteries requiring vaults that are
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
much more applicable in my experience
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of one cemetery in all of
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
coast county which is the largest as you
 
01:15:50.239 --> 01:15:51.030 align:start position:0%
coast county which is the largest as you
know

01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
that allows green burial
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
and each cemetery requires that on their
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
own basis as is previously stated um
 
01:15:58.159 --> 01:15:59.590 align:start position:0%
own basis as is previously stated um
cost

01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
i think there's been a misrepresentation
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
in my own opinion
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
mr slocum i'm sorry if i didn't get your
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
name right
 
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.110 align:start position:0%
name right
uh

01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh i think is right with you know
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
embalming in my experience with new
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire funeral homes goes from you
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
know somewhere around 595 dollars to up
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
to a thousand dollars i'm sure i'm not
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a scientific estimate
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
but that's only one cost involved with
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
the funeral process the federal trade
 
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
commission has a whole list of items
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
that we have to follow and many more
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
are applicable not just embalming so i
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
think that may have been misunderstood
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
and i finally i think i would argue that
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
refrigeration is the best form of
 
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
temporary storage embalming is a
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
temporary process but in my experience
 
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
an embalmed body is
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
much better suited for temporary storage
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
than a refrigerated one and to not
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
require embalming for winter storage
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
which kind of came up a little bit i
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
think would be not dignified number one
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
and not sanitary go to a hospital
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
doctors nurses everyone's gowned up to
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
deal with somebody with body fluids
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's probably
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
viewing an unbound body can be a health
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
hazard i'm not you know a physician or
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
anything like that i think it could be i
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
more often than not a psychological uh
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
type of issue but i would say that
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%

[Music]

01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
is a bill that no patient left a loan
 
01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.590 align:start position:0%
is a bill that no patient left a loan
act

01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
when this
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
bill was brought to my attention this is
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
a bill that passed the oklahoma
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
legislature and was signed into law
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
in may of 2021.
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
i jumped right on this because the last
 
01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
six months have been
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
horrible in my life
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
so i just want to share my experience
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
and how i firmly believe
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
that no one
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
should be left alone to die
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
i left alone in an icu without a loved
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:54.070 align:start position:0%
i left alone in an icu without a loved
one

01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
i do believe it makes a difference
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
and i will die on that sword
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
so in september my mother passed away
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
a month and a half later my 86 year old
 
01:20:08.159 --> 01:20:09.669 align:start position:0%
a month and a half later my 86 year old
stepfather

01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
stepfather
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
whom i had to go check on frequently
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
because he lived in rochester and was
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
stubborn and wouldn't come and live with
 
01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.950 align:start position:0%
stubborn and wouldn't come and live with
us

01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
had fallen
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
so i called an ambulance he was taken to
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
the hospital and sent home
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
that i got him into bed and said i'll be
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
back in the morning
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
in the morning i got there he had fallen
 
01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.510 align:start position:0%
in the morning i got there he had fallen
again

01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
so i called an ambulance and took him to
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
a different hospital
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
and i am his dpoa so sitting in the
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
hospital room with him
 
01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.390 align:start position:0%
hospital room with him
until

01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
until
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
he got a positive covet test then they
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
kicked me out
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
now mind you i'm vaccinated
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
i thought i was doing everything right
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
and i was thrown out to leave my 86 year
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
old stepfather alone in the hospital
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
not knowing if he was going to live or
 
01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.350 align:start position:0%
not knowing if he was going to live or
die

01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i was mortified i
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
he was already severely depressed having
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
lost the love of his life of 42 years
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
and to leave him alone i felt was
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
so cruel
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
so he was quarantined for 14 days during
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
i got a call
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
that my little brother was in the icu
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
and i needed to get out there because
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
before he was intubated he made me his
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
dpoa i wish people would quit doing that
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
and my little brother was in the icu i
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
got to go in i had to show my vaccine
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
card i was going to do whatever they
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
wanted me to do
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
to be there with him
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
so he knew he was loved he could hear my
 
01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.390 align:start position:0%
so he knew he was loved he could hear my
voice

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
voice
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
so while i was there
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
in that room every day holding his hand
 
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
the doctor came in and said to me you
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
are his medicine
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
everyone should have their medicine with
 
01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.629 align:start position:0%
everyone should have their medicine with
them

01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
no one
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
should die
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
wondering where is their loved one
 
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
why aren't they here with me to comfort
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
sadly when i left hawaii that night
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
by the time my plane landed my brother
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
so then
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
i have a friend angie simpson
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
whose 31 year old daughter jessica
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
she could not be there with her daughter
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't let her in she didn't get
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
to hold her she didn't get to whisper in
 
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
and sadly jessica died she was 31
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
without her mom
 
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
then my friend shannon
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
just passed away a week and a half ago
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
from koben in an icu
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
by herself
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
with no family member
 
01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:42.470 align:start position:0%
with no family member
near

01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
near
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
to speak to her
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
and i know
 
01:23:46.159 --> 01:23:47.030 align:start position:0%
and i know
that

01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
these have been trying times
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
and we're all learning
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
and while
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the fact that they can
 
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
facetime family members it's not the
 
01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.149 align:start position:0%
facetime family members it's not the
same

01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
it is not the same as feeling that loved
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
and whether i don't know if it was more
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
comforting for me
 
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
to be with my brother or more comforting
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
for him
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
but regardless that doctor said
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
i was his medicine
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's from a doctor
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
i need a tissue i didn't i was hoping i
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.159 --> 01:24:42.950 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
i firmly believe that it's cruel thank
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
i believe that it's cruel
 
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
and it should not happen
 
01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.149 align:start position:0%
and it should not happen
again

01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
i would have done whatever i had to do
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
to be there with my loved one and i
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
think anyone else would do the same
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
if not someone in their family
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
but they should not be dying alone we
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
have done a huge disservice to our
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
elderly who have been left alone without
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
their loved ones
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i just don't know how as a society
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
how we can
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
accept that
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's all and i i've also passed out
 
01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:28.629 align:start position:0%
that's all and i i've also passed out
information

01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:25:28.639 --> 01:25:30.149 align:start position:0%
information
um

01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the the law in oklahoma and
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
regarding a couple from i believe it was
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
chicago whose newborn baby tested
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
positive for covid and they wouldn't let
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
the mother near it to even nurse it
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
there's something wrong
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
there is something wrong
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
and and that's that's all i can take any
 
01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.189 align:start position:0%
and and that's that's all i can take any
questions

01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:25:57.199 --> 01:25:58.310 align:start position:0%
questions
sure

01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
is your experience
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
that of my recent experience
 
01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.030 align:start position:0%
that of my recent experience
in

01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
talking to
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
the chief executive officer of a new
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
who said this law is not necessary
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
because we do all these things now just
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
like this
 
01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
no this law is necessary i wouldn't be
 
01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.709 align:start position:0%
no this law is necessary i wouldn't be
here

01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
if this law wasn't necessary i wouldn't
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
be sitting here
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
my follow-up would be
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
then this law is no threat
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
to a hospital who's already doing it
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely not be a threat to the ones
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
who aren't correct
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
is that your experience that is my
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%

01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
i thought that i thought that these
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
we as a society had had saw
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
how bad this was in the early days of
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
covert and this this had
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
changed it wasn't being done anymore but
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
you're saying that just two weeks ago
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
you were denied to see someone
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
this has been
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
my mother passed away

4th
 
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
since september 4th i have dealt with
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
more nurses hospitals
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%

uh i have my question is on the bill um
 
01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:02.229 align:start position:0%
uh i have my question is on the bill um
on

01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:28:02.239 --> 01:28:03.510 align:start position:0%
on
page

01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.189 align:start position:0%
page
uh

01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
on the first page of the bill
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
language on in section three it's line
 
01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:11.430 align:start position:0%
language on in section three it's line
12.

01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
12.
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
um this section says a healthcare
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
facility may establish visitation
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
policies that limit or restrict
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
visitation when and then it goes through
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
a couple of
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
reasons that they could deny visits and
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
my concern is that
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
for a the presence of visitors would be
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
medically or therapeutically
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
contraindicated in the best clinical
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
judgment of healthcare professionals i'm
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
concerned that that would kind of um
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
provide opportunity for a doctor
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
or a nurse to
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
and i and i i agree to a sense um i
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
think we have to afford them some leeway
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
because we are not privy to every case
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
that's in there i mean for example i
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
would think a mass casualty casualty
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
incident would be
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know not in the best interest of
 
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
everyone to have a a hospital full of
 
01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:06.950 align:start position:0%
everyone to have a a hospital full of
people

01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
you know looking for their loved ones
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
when they're they're trying to care for
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know a number of people at the same
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
time but i mean listen
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm open to suggestions this spill is
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
now in your hands and i trust that you
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
all will do
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
what's best and right
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
and i really
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
express right
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
where it comes to
 
01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.790 align:start position:0%
where it comes to
humanity

01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
humanity
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
and people
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
that's where i am
 
01:29:43.199 --> 01:29:47.910 align:start position:0%
that's where i am
representative

01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um and thanks for
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question and it's a follow-up
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
actually on representative cushman's
 
01:29:52.639 --> 01:29:53.750 align:start position:0%
actually on representative cushman's
question

01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.270 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
clarification i think is is the concern
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
because what do we mean by medically or
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
therapeutically contraindicated and what
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
i was a little bit concerned about is
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
there are some procedures we do to
 
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
people that are
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
can be for the lay person a bit gruesome
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
intonation draining a large
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
pocket of pus
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
these could be done at the bedside um or
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
insertion of a central line
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
they oftentimes may faint in the middle
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
of this and we can't be resuscitating
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
them at the same time
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm just trying to figure out again
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
that that issue of how we define these
 
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
because it's probably not medically
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
contraindicated nor therapeutically but
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
just as you were here for much of the
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
last bill it's a little bit of
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
a queasiness factor perhaps for some
 
01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:39.430 align:start position:0%
a queasiness factor perhaps for some
people

01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
you might want to warn them you really
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
ought not to be in here because well i
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
think that yeah well i think that um
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals do that now um you know listen
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
this is what we're going to do be doing
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
you may want to step outside
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of times i step outside
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
because i am queasy
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to see it but you know
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
it so could i mean cpr is very brutal
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know i mean
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
but this is something that you know
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
people need to
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
understand when they're going in but i
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
don't find it to be a reason to keep
 
01:31:12.639 --> 01:31:14.310 align:start position:0%
don't find it to be a reason to keep
someone

01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:17.669 align:start position:0%
someone
away

01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
follow up uh
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
but that's what i'm trying to start out
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
there yeah
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
your final comment is but it's not a
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
reason to keep them away so you're
 
01:31:24.639 --> 01:31:25.430 align:start position:0%
reason to keep them away so you're
saying

01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
this should not be construed as to
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
a lot as to allow the hospital say you
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in here when we're going to
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
be intubating this person
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
well i think that
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
i think maybe we could find
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
some better language if you have any
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
suggestions you know what i mean but i
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a reason to kill the
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
bill i think it's a reason to work on it
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
and and and bring some humanity
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
and compassion to
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
these sick people
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
chairman pearson and thank you
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
representative rice
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
my own personal experience with my
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
mother when she was older and in the
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
hospital for specific reasons
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
she had diminished capacity for
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
understanding what was happening and so
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
the staff actually liked that i was
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
there because it kept her calmer
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
she had an infectious disease
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
what the hospital
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
asked me to do which i comply
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
was to make sure i wore gloves a gown
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
and a mask
 
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
every time i stepped into the room
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
i took it all off
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
as i left
 
01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.510 align:start position:0%
as i left
and

01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
redid that every time i went in and out
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
of that room
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
um would you be comfortable
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
um if we
 
01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.430 align:start position:0%
um if we
somehow

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
um did an amendment where uh that one
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
section that representative cushman uh
 
01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:57.590 align:start position:0%
section that representative cushman uh
referenced

01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh was replaced with uh something to the
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
effect that
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
the facility
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
could um
 
01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:06.830 align:start position:0%
could um
could

01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
you to have protected
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
whatever it is in um oh that's online
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
money yeah okay so we're upset with that
 
01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:20.830 align:start position:0%
money yeah okay so we're upset with that
but

01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
um okay listen i certainly don't want to
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
make anyone's jobs harder but i will
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
agree i don't
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
you know um but i do believe that you
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
are absolutely correct that i had to
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
have my stepdad in the er two weeks ago
 
01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:38.790 align:start position:0%
have my stepdad in the er two weeks ago
and

01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
he was a little combative they didn't
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
want me to leave
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
and the only reason i got to go in was
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
because i was his dpoa
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
right and at the time he had a lot of
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
confusion and couldn't make decisions on
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
his own
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
but they didn't want me to leave because
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
they couldn't check on him
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
i was in the er six days after i tested
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
positive for covid not for covert
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
related symptoms but for something else
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
and they made my husband my husband
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
whom i live with
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
sit in the truck
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
and put me in a room i swear no bigger
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
than a closet on a gurney that couldn't
 
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
even be stretched out flat because it
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't fit
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
closed the door left me in there alone
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
for two hours
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
could have died in there nobody would
 
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
have known
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
right so what harm would it have done to
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
have my husband in that room with me
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
and and that's and i again i don't mean
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
to sound unsympathetic to our health
 
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
care workers i know they're strapped
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i feel for them
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
we have to look at both sides of the
 
01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:49.669 align:start position:0%
we have to look at both sides of the
picture

01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
picture
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
question and i'm so sorry
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
for your losses
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
as i look at this
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
does not the language that is on line 16
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
that says the presence of visitors would
 
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
interfere with the care of or rights of
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
any patient
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
deal with the concerns that oh my gosh
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
somebody's standing there and they're
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
going to pass out and the medical
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
professionals are going to have to step
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
over them while they're trying to care
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
for the person who is ill
 
01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.390 align:start position:0%
for the person who is ill
and

01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
not clear from the language that's
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
submitted here do you know what let me
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
just take a detour do you know if this
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
has been adopted anywhere other than it
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
has oklahoma yeah i think arkansas has
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
something similar going i'm not for
 
01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:54.830 align:start position:0%
something similar going i'm not for
certain

01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
um but you know i will say you know it
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
has been signed into law in arkansas in
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
may of 2021 and

01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
through i've known many of you for many
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
years so
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's been tough time for many
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
i'm here to provide at least
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
three areas within the bill that we're
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
asking the committee to look at we're
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
certainly here as a resource to
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
represent rice to this committee to
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
leadership uh for both um parties to
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
working on legislation um and i think
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
that representative cushman
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
representative connerk and represent
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
weber uh and also reverend folsom
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
pointed out a couple of the items that i
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
would like to touch upon very briefly
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
looking on page one of the newly created
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
rsa 151 colon 2j which would create the
 
01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
visitation policies for the presence of
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
parents and spouse and caregivers you'll
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
see in paragraphs one and two that it
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
enumerates in paragraph one
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
as it would relate to children or minors
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
and then paragraph two as this law would
 
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
relate to each adult
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
the reference that you'll see in both
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph one and two on lines six and
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
ten respectively make reference to those
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities that are licensed
 
01:37:53.310 --> 01:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa
 
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
151.2 and for those of you who have your
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
laptops open and you actually can open
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
up to see what 151 2 specifically states
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
that there is no specific definition
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
within that rsa for healthcare
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
facilities so you'll see that the
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
as currently drafted should have further
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
consideration to identify what types of
 
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
facilities if we're talking about
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
hospitals are we talking about
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
ambulatory surgical care centers are we
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
talking about nursing homes in long long
 
01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
term care facilities but it also
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
includes such entities as adult day care
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
and the community
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
health clinics and
 
01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:34.950 align:start position:0%
health clinics and
the

01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
various other facilities such as renal
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
dialysis so the net is currently drafted
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
because of the specific reference to rsa
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
151 just needs to be teased out a bit
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
more to identify which specific
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
facilities that are being identified as
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
part of the legislation
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'd like now to move to my second
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
commentary around starting on page two
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
on starting on lines 4
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
through line
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
line 7 which is paragraph 7 of the
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
proposed newly created section
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
in 151
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
it provides that in paragraph seven that
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
each healthcare facility license
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa 151-2 and again we see
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
the reference that it's too broad
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
it shall post on its website information
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
materials it's the following language
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
where it says developed by the
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
department of health and services
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
again developed by the department of
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
health human services explaining the
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
right specific uh specified in this
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
section that the following sentence also
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
is of concern which is the department
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
shall develop such informational
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
materials and make the materials
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
available to health care facilities our
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
facility for this purpose
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
currently under the licensing oversight
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
that we have as an agency this would be
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
the first of its kind in terms of us
 
01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
providing direction to those facilities
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
in this manner
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
we would request consideration for that
 
01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
to be placed upon the facilities
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
themselves to work together
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
collaboratively to define what that
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
standard would be and what type of
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
notices so again it's because we do the
 
01:40:09.189 --> 01:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight of the facilities
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh and this would be again something
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
that we have not
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
been required to do in new hampshire uh
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
until this this legislation before you
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
so again we don't think that the idea is
 
01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh necessarily a bad idea but we do
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
think that it should not be something
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
that the department should be involved
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
with so as to paragraph seven we just
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask for deletion of the
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
references to the department if you
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
start with the first
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
sentence you would just have to on line
 
01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:39.669 align:start position:0%
sentence you would just have to on line
five

01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
delete from the word developed all the
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
way through the word services
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
and then on the final sentence for
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
paragraph seven delete the
 
01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
entirety of that sentence that directs
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
the department to perform that otherwise
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
we would not have further concerns as to
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
that particular section but also but i
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
would like to defer also to the health
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
care provider community that i
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate will be testifying because it
 
01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
may have additional thoughts so i don't
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
want my commentary to be limiting to
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
them but rather focusing on the
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
department and what our
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
scope of our regulatory authority would
 
01:41:12.159 --> 01:41:13.430 align:start position:0%
scope of our regulatory authority would
be

01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph eight which starts on lines
 
01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
eight through line 17 of the bill and i
 
01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
think it goes back to represent cushman
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
who identified in an earlier provision
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
where there was some need to bring
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
greater clarity if you'll see here it
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
says specifically unless expressively
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
required by federal law or regulation
 
01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
the department or any other state agency
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
shall not
 
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
take any action against a health care
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
facility for
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
and it's just a drafting item because
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
usually when we're granted authority
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
shall you shall be able to do this you
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
can do this as opposed to you shall not
 
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
and then you know the enumerated items
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
below um just need further clarification
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
as to what direction to give to the
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
department for purposes of its
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight i think of some
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
concern would be starting on line 12
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
under subparagraph roman 8 b
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
failing to protect now just put this in
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
perspective with the introductory clause
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
or any other state agency shall not take
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
any action for healthcare our healthcare
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
facility for and and b it says for
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
failing to protect or otherwise ensure
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
the safety or comfort comfort of a
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
visitor given access to a property or
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
location controlled by the healthcare
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
facility and true we wouldn't be looking
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily as to individuals who are on
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
the property we'd be looking at the
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
facilities itself again but obviously
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
the focus on patient and in people's
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
safety it just it just raised the
 
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
question in terms of is this the uh what
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
proponents for the bill really would
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
like to see in terms of not being able
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
to take action relative to individual
 
01:42:49.679 --> 01:42:50.790 align:start position:0%
to take action relative to individual
safety

01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
and then paragraph c and again i'm
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
trying to be careful because we really
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to encroach upon those areas
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
from a regulatory oversight but if we
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
were requested to doing that you could
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
see where it would be problematic for
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
the department uh the next
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
item is under subparagraph roman 8c
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
starting in line 14 failing to follow
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
the guidelines for these
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
cdc and prevention or other federal
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines that require or recommend
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
restricted visitor access and uh as as
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
you know um you know that would be
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
something that would be contrary to what
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
the department's general missions and
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
goals are relative to
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
adherence to guidelines to protect
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
individuals so we just would ask for
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
further consideration about how that
 
01:43:36.629 --> 01:43:36.639 align:start position:0%
would be drafted
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
in a more
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
taking the word not out in the
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
introductory and then identifying
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
specifically what it is you're looking
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
for the department either to do so with
 
01:43:45.119 --> 01:43:45.830 align:start position:0%
for the department either to do so with
that

01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
that concludes my um
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
overview of the three areas that the
 
01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.189 align:start position:0%
overview of the three areas that the
department

01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
had concerns about but i just want to
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
emphasize again heartfelt
 
01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:56.870 align:start position:0%
emphasize again heartfelt
um

01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
thoughts towards
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
miss representative rice and her family
 
01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
and also that we are here as a resources
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
assist at as appropriate with
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
the language around the bill thank you
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.639 --> 01:44:15.669 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:15.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
asked for questions
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
the committee services has texted me and
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
said they're going to do a research on
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
similar legislation either pending or
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
enacted in other states so we can have
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
comparisons on all of these things
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr williams and it's always
 
01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
good to see you again because you share
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
i wonder if some of your objections and
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
some of my concerns might be addressed
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
when we have on line eight of page two
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
unless expressly required by federal law
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
or regulation the department or any
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
other state state agency and i'll work
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
out the shell knots and shells later
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
because that's making my brain explode
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
at the moment but
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh shall not take any action
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
against a health facility for and what i
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
would like to add in is arising out of
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
this statute because there are lots of
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
other things that a health facility
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
might do
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
that we might all very much like the
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
apart department to take action about
 
01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.910 align:start position:0%
apart department to take action about
and

01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:32.790 align:start position:0%
and
then

01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
so would that be okay and then i have a
 
01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.229 align:start position:0%
so would that be okay and then i have a
follow-up

01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
it would be okay okay
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
and then my follow-up is
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
i was very concerned about the failing
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
to protect or otherwise ensure the
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
safety or comfort of a visitor
 
01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:49.270 align:start position:0%
safety or comfort of a visitor
but

01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
this section only applies to the
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
department so there would still be the
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
entire body of tort law available for
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
a visitor
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
whose um
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
safety has been interfered with so
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
they're not left without a remedy
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
that would be my understanding as well
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay and and would you
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
um would you be willing to forward me
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
the suggestion of how we get rid of the
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
shall not and make that into a shell
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
because i'm having a hard time
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
explaining how i say shall
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
make it a positive shell but forbidding
 
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
you to do
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
i can say shall be forbidden to but i
 
01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
don't see the difference between that
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
and shall not so if you have suggestions
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
i'd appreciate them thank you and
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
represent pearson you've just seen the
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
exercise of some of the difficulty that
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be worked out so we certainly
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
would be a resource to represent weber
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
um my initial thought would be that
 
01:46:51.189 --> 01:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
typically in statute when it provides us
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
with regulatory oversight it is a we're
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
being provided with authority not told
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
what not not to do so it does it does
 
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
beg the question well what do we do and
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
why is this important to having in here
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
particularly if we don't have oversight
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
as you point out of those individuals uh
 
01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of visitors and their safety so
 
01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
calling it out here in these exceptions
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
pulls us more into that conversation and
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps you may even want to reconsider
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
the entirety of that section and what it
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
actually brings to the um to bear on the
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
goals of the underlying legislation does
 
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
it really add more or does it cause so
 
01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
much confusion that it actually makes
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
more complicated the goals of access to
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
loved ones during their final stages of
 
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
life you and mr chair could i make a
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
question of the chair you may make
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
although before you do
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
i am going to
 
01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
ask the members of this committee
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
to think about whether you'd like to be
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
on the amendment writing team
 
01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:53.030 align:start position:0%
on the amendment writing team
with

01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
all kinds of nice friends and so on now
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
you may inquire the chair well i was
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
going to acquire the chair if the chair
 
01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
would consider this bill to have an
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
actual proper subcommittee process
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
because it sounds to me that like there
 
01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
are a lot of players here
 
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
and it's a very important concept
 
01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:15.270 align:start position:0%
and it's a very important concept
and

01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
as one who very much appreciates all the
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
efforts of everybody on the various
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
and sundry ad hoc
 
01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:26.229 align:start position:0%
and sundry ad hoc
teams

01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
teams
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
i'd really like to get this one right
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
for everybody and i wonder if you would
 
01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
consider an appropriate subcommittee and
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
i'd certainly be glad to volunteer for
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
that thank you the chair and the
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:48:42.239 --> 01:48:43.910 align:start position:0%
any other questions
for

01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%

representative aaron would you like to
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%

01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is an extremely important bill
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
and it is also very personal for me and
 
01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
my constituents
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
from my own experience
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
this past october
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
my husband fell ill
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
and i had to take him to the emergency
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
room at dartmouth-hitchcock hospital in
 
01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:46.070 align:start position:0%

keene
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
they would not allow me to accompany him
 
01:49:48.159 --> 01:49:49.270 align:start position:0%
they would not allow me to accompany him
inside

01:49:49.270 --> 01:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
inside
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
because they had just instituted a code
 
01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:52.790 align:start position:0%
because they had just instituted a code
red

01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
red
 
01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
which was a policy that did not allow
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
anyone but the patient inside the
 
01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:59.350 align:start position:0%
anyone but the patient inside the
hospital

01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
i couldn't even sit and wait with him in
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
the waiting room
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
a waiting room by the way which had
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
other sick people in there waiting for
 
01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.669 align:start position:0%
other sick people in there waiting for
care

01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
if i was already with my husband at home
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
then what sense was it to keep us apart
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
if the facility is worried about
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
transmission of an illness be it viral
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
or otherwise
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
they can certainly require accompanying
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
or visiting family members and loved
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
ones to wear the same ppe or protective
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
gear as a facility staff caring for
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
these patients daily do
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
those caregivers also go out to grocery
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
stores home to their loved ones and
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
other places after seeing patients all
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
day long
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
sensible accommodations can be made with
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
visitors and people accompanying family
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
to doctors offices or to emergency rooms
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
that was an awful feeling that i could
 
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
not be by my husband's side in his time
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
of need nor could i advocate for him
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
they made me wait outside the building
 
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
and they watched me like i was some sort
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
of criminal
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
i'd been caring for him at home and knew
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
all the particulars of his care
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
i had valuable observations that i could
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
share with those seeing and treating him
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
they would have none of it
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
i tried to reason with the people there
 
01:51:17.119 --> 01:51:18.149 align:start position:0%
i tried to reason with the people there
calling

01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
calling
 
01:51:19.990 --> 01:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
calling the supervisor and spoke to
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
people in charge
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
but they refused to let me be my by my
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
husband's side
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'd never experienced anything like this
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
before in my life and i hope i never do
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
again it was frightening and went
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
against everything i had ever
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
experienced with the medical community
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
i was so scared
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
because i had no idea what was going on
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
or if i'd ever see my husband again
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
do you understand that
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
i'll say it again
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
i had no idea if i would ever see my
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
husband alive again
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
can you put yourself in that situation
 
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
for just a moment
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
can you imagine how that felt
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
what would you have done in that
 
01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.790 align:start position:0%
what would you have done in that
situation

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
you feel helpless
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
and completely cut off
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
countless of people have been in that
 
01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:18.470 align:start position:0%
countless of people have been in that
situation

01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
and it is not okay
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
to continue to allow that to happen
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic or no pandemic
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
thankfully my husband was fine and was
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
sent home after a half an
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
hour and a half of observation and
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
whatever tests they gave him
 
01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
but i have a good friend of mine who
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
wasn't that fortunate
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
and she never saw her husband alive
 
01:52:45.599 --> 01:52:47.350 align:start position:0%
and she never saw her husband alive
again

01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
he died a week and a half later in the
 
01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:50.709 align:start position:0%
he died a week and a half later in the
icu

01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
icu
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
with no one no loved ones there by his
 
01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.270 align:start position:0%
with no one no loved ones there by his
side

01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:52:58.470 --> 01:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't even let her see him
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
or hold his hand when he died
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
she couldn't speak to him or communicate
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
with him during that time either since
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
we've had this same situation happen to
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
our elderly our mothers and fathers our
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
grandmothers and grandfathers
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
ending up dying alone in an
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
institutional setting
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
how is that okay
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
no one should be sick and be alone and
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
certainly no one should die alone
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
we cannot continue to allow this to
 
01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
happen to families and loved ones it is
 
01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:36.229 align:start position:0%
happen to families and loved ones it is
barbaric

01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
barbaric
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
and it is immoral to bar spouses and
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
family members from being with their
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
loved ones in times of crisis especially
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
when the person needing care doesn't
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
know what's going on or cannot make
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
medical decisions on their own
 
01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
we cannot let this type of policy
 
01:53:56.070 --> 01:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
continue to stand and i hope that you
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
will pass this bill out of your
 
01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:58.629 align:start position:0%
will pass this bill out of your

you seem to you know feel fit to do
 
01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:08.550 align:start position:0%
you seem to you know feel fit to do
but

01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
do it so no one has to live with the
 
01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
anger the guilt or the lack of closure
 
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
that these policies create in families
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
in sickness and at the end of life
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you listening
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions any
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%

of years during the covid

01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
when they wanted to be with loved ones

that were being cared for in a hospital
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
the hospitals have learned a lot through
 
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
these last two years here in new
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire and nationally
 
01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
regarding how visitation policies can
 
01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
impact loved ones wanting to be with

their family member in the hospital
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately due to the nature of the
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the lack of personal
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
protective equipment early in the
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic among other reasons the
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals had to limit visitors for
 
01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
their safety as well as for the patients
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
they care for
 
01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
their visitation policies were modified
 
01:56:11.669 --> 01:56:11.679 align:start position:0%
to ensure patient staff and visitor
 
01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
safety since then however many changes
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
have been made to allow for visitors and
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
designated caregivers to be present
 
01:56:20.709 --> 01:56:20.719 align:start position:0%
under many circumstances
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
in addition to visitors being allowed to
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
be present when a patient was at their
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
end of life hospitals have allowances
 
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
for maternity labor and delivery
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
patients pediatric patients disabled
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
patients and outpatient procedures
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
federal centers for medicare medicaid
 
01:56:38.709 --> 01:56:38.719 align:start position:0%
services cms conditions of participation
 
01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
require hospitals to have a visitation
 
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
policy and the current hospital
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
visitation policies were developed by
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
compassionate individuals at our
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
hospitals the hospital's individual
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
policies established with clinical input
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
all are posted on their websites
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
and have been designed to balance
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
visitors access safety of all involved
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
and caring of compassion and support for
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
patients while they are in the hospital
 
01:57:04.709 --> 01:57:04.719 align:start position:0%
of course visitor policies may vary
 
01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
slightly by hospital for reasons such as
 
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
visiting hours
 
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
while our hospitals are asking what our
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
hospitals are asking is that they are
 
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
afforded the op the ability to implement
 
01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
visitor policies that provide needed
 
01:57:16.159 --> 01:57:17.510 align:start position:0%
visitor policies that provide needed
flexibility

01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
while balancing the very important needs
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
our of patients to have visitors and
 
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
caregivers by their side
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
i was told recently that a hospital had
 
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
to adjust their visitor policy twice in
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
one week due to the current coveted
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
surge that they were dealing with on top
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
of other high demand for inpatient care
 
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
for non-coveted patients
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
it is difficult to legislate that type
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
of flexibility
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
in addition there are other federal
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
requirements such as occupational safety
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
and health administration osha that
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
require screening of all those that
 
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
enter a hospital if a visitor is ill the
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
hospital is not allowed by law to let
 
01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
them in the hospitals need to be allowed
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
to adjust their visitation policies
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
quickly depending on the changes in
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
circumstance in their hospital or in the
 
01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:04.310 align:start position:0%
circumstance in their hospital or in the
community

01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
one other issue that's already been
 
01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
noted by um
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
by john williams um is in reviewing this
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
bill the statute being modified actually
 
01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
applies to both hospitals and nursing
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
homes and but the bill is silent
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
regarding nursing home visitor policies
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
but the bill is drafted if passed would
 
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
also include nursing homes it's unclear
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
if that was the intent of the sponsor
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
for these reasons the hospital
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
association is concerned about this bill
 
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
as drafted and we are certainly willing
 
01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
to work with the sponsor to determine if
 
01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
there is a way to amend this bill that
 
01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
addresses the hospital's valid concerns
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
and i will say i have spoken with
 
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative rice numerous times
 
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
starting with when the lsr was issued so
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
she has been very open and willing to
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
chat with us and we appreciate that and
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
she agreed yes just yesterday to sit
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
down with us to talk further so we are
 
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
happy to continue those dialogues and i
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
01:58:59.109 --> 01:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
important that those that have developed
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
these policies be part of the
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
working through what the um
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
what an amendment if an amendment um is
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
is introduced in this committee be
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
considered and thank you for the
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide comments and
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative canuck thank you very
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
much uh just a quick question
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
given the fact that a lot of the issues
 
01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
that came up were about covert and as
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
you pointed out we did not know in the
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
beginning a lot of stuff we didn't know
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
the ppe
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
um and this bill in a sense is kind of a
 
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
public health bill because it has to do
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
with the public health
 
01:59:32.639 --> 01:59:33.589 align:start position:0%
with the public health
um

01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
do you do you think that it is
 
01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
not a good idea to
 
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
place in statute restrictions on how
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
one may respond to a public health
 
01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:43.750 align:start position:0%
one may respond to a public health
emergency

01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
that i think is a valid concern and and
 
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
i think that that is maybe why um the
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
department raised some issues and why
 
01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
hospital visitation policies have not
 
01:59:55.830 --> 01:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
been in place um have
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
hospital visitation policies have not
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
been in statute and um nationwide in
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
talking with my colleagues throughout
 
02:00:04.229 --> 02:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
the country um very few states have
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
actually implemented
 
02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
such policies to date
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
some have
 
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
worked on it but
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
i i think it'll be really interesting to
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
see what legislative services comes out
 
02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
with legislative research because um
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
there are very few um so hospitals have
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
been around as you know for a long time
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
um and hospital visitation policies are
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
a requirement again of conditions of
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
participation and they have them and i
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
encourage everyone to go on the
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
hospital's websites because they do post
 
02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:35.270 align:start position:0%
hospital's websites because they do post
those

02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
hospital visitation policies
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
and again they try to make exceptions
 
02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:41.750 align:start position:0%
and again they try to make exceptions
for

02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
what i identified relative to end of
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
life um
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
a disabled individual those that need a
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
caregiver etc um labor and delivery um
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
but i think um there are real concerns
 
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
like you said representative relative to
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
um public health concerns that it would
 
02:01:01.830 --> 02:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
be hard to it'll be difficult to try to
 
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
figure out how to
 
02:01:06.149 --> 02:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
legislate that
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro thank you mr
 
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:11.270 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
um giving your um
 
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
quite eloquent description of how
 
02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.470 align:start position:0%
quite eloquent description of how
hospital

02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
personnel come together to make these
 
02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
how difficult it is
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
and how much effort is put into it
 
02:01:32.229 --> 02:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
given that and given um line 14 on the
 
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
first page of the bill where
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
allowing limits or restrictions if the
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
presence of visitors would be medically
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
or therapeutically contraindicated
 
02:01:46.629 --> 02:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
in the best
 
02:01:48.629 --> 02:01:48.639 align:start position:0%
clinical judgment
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
of healthcare professionals which would
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
be the hospitals
 
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.189 align:start position:0%
be the hospitals
um

02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
i'm having a little difficulty seeing
 
02:01:55.199 --> 02:01:55.430 align:start position:0%
i'm having a little difficulty seeing
where

02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:56.790 align:start position:0%
where
[Music]

02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
this would change anything
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of the process that's already
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
in place in healthcare facilities
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
um i that that line may not be a problem
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
but um other parts of the of the bill
 
02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
are more um expansive so i i think we'd
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
have to go through every part of the
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
bill again um i've met with a lot of the
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals um
 
02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
and that was the feedback i received
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
that this there are some
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
issues with this bill and as
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative rice um clearly and and
 
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
correctly stated this comes from
 
02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
oklahoma the oklahoma hospital
 
02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
association was involved
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
in drought in in amending this bill
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
quite significantly to what it is today
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
but that's oklahoma that is not new
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire um and i would um appreciate
 
02:02:47.589 --> 02:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
and um expect and i think we will have a
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire solution not an oklahoma
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
solution thank you
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
now because we are running very very
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
late here we're going to move on and the
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
final three speakers i have no more pink

02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:36.550 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members um
i

02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:03:38.229 --> 02:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
speak in support of this bill i actually
 
02:03:43.350 --> 02:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
have a situation not covered related but
 
02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
happened during the covet pandemic a
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
25-year-old mom
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
um she had had a c-section the month
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
before she was ill so she went back to
 
02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
the emergency room her partner was not
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to go into the emergency room
 
02:03:58.870 --> 02:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
with her
 
02:03:58.880 --> 02:03:59.750 align:start position:0%
with her
um

02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:02.229 --> 02:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
and um because of the current status
 
02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
that she was the current condition that
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
her situation was in i suspect but i
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
don't know because no one went in with
 
02:04:12.629 --> 02:04:12.639 align:start position:0%
her that she was not able to accurately
 
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
explain why she was presenting at the
 
02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
emergency room
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
they gave her a prescription and sent
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
her on her way she collapsed in the
 
02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
parking lot
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
her husband saw her collapse he
 
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
immediately took her to another hospital
 
02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
by the time she got to the other
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
hospital she was declared brain dead
 
02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:33.109 align:start position:0%
hospital she was declared brain dead
um

02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's unacceptable
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
i now have
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
we now have four children
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
that have no mother
 
02:04:43.990 --> 02:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
we now have a significant other that
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
feels somehow it was his fault
 
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
that he didn't take her to the other
 
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
hospital in the first place because he
 
02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:52.790 align:start position:0%
hospital in the first place because he
knew

02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
knew
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
the potential of the of the limitations
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
and he chose to take her to the closest
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
one instead of the one that was the that
 
02:05:04.709 --> 02:05:04.719 align:start position:0%
she wanted to go to
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
the bottom line here is is that i
 
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
understand the concerns i understand the
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
concerns with department of health and
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
human services i understand the concerns
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is our hospitals
 
02:05:19.589 --> 02:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
have become such a reactive situational
 
02:05:19.599 --> 02:05:20.709 align:start position:0%
have become such a reactive situational
place

02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
that i feel that a bill like this will
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
put some checks and balances on that
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
in two minutes wow
 
02:05:34.229 --> 02:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
we'll make a video of this and show it
 
02:05:36.430 --> 02:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
to others thank you so much
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%

to the to the last speaker but i can ask
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
you the question also um i'm just
 
02:05:50.229 --> 02:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
reviewing the um
 
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire statute
 
02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:53.830 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire statute
on

02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
residential care and health facility
 
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
licensing licensing that's 151 there's a
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights under there
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
and number uh
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
number roman numeral
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
where did it go
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
well first of all it says that patients
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
shall be free to communicate with
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
associate with and meet privately with
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
anyone including family
 
02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:17.189 align:start position:0%
anyone including family
and

02:06:17.189 --> 02:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
resident groups unless it would infringe
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
upon the rights of other patients
 
02:06:21.599 --> 02:06:22.870 align:start position:0%
upon the rights of other patients
and

02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
um it also says they'll be
 
02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
entitled to have
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
there's already in statute something
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
about minors being entitled to have
 
02:06:34.069 --> 02:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
um their spouse or i mean i'm sorry
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
their parents if they're a minor
 
02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:37.589 align:start position:0%
their parents if they're a minor
and

02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:41.350 --> 02:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
for adults their spouse or next of kin
 
02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
visit the facility without restriction
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
um especially if they're considered
 
02:06:46.709 --> 02:06:46.719 align:start position:0%
terminally ill
 
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
um jump towards a question so i'm just
 
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
wondering do you think that
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
the practices that we're hearing about
 
02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:53.750 align:start position:0%
the practices that we're hearing about
today

02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
are upholding that law that already
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
exists and and that that's why we need
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
to make it very clear to the hospitals
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
that under no circumstances can they
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
violate it thank you for the question uh
 
02:07:08.229 --> 02:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
yes i agree that that that the patient's
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
rights should be
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
um more important than the
 
02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:14.030 align:start position:0%
um more important than the
potential

02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
potential
 
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
ramifications of making it more
 
02:07:20.149 --> 02:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
difficult for the facility uh but i also
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
think that it's very important that
 
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
they that our hospitals and healthcare
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
facilities cannot hide behind the guys
 
02:07:29.669 --> 02:07:29.679 align:start position:0%
if it's an emergency so we don't have to
 
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
follow the rules thank you thank you and
 
02:07:34.950 --> 02:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:07:38.229 --> 02:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative betty gay asks for two
 
02:07:38.239 --> 02:07:45.030 align:start position:0%
representative betty gay asks for two
minutes

02:07:45.030 --> 02:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.109 --> 02:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
these rules are harkening back to the
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
1920s in the hospitals uh i had an aunt
 
02:07:51.669 --> 02:07:51.679 align:start position:0%
who was
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
20 years older than my mother who was a
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
nurse then and the rules there were
 
02:07:58.709 --> 02:07:58.719 align:start position:0%
totally different from now president
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
eisenhower's first baby
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
died as they watched him in the house
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
through the windows in the hospital
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
because they were not permitted to be
 
02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:12.870 --> 02:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
so they ended up with one son after many
 
02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
years but that heartbreak was
 
02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:17.830 align:start position:0%
years but that heartbreak was
devastating

02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
personally for me in a nursing home one
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
of my friends who was 97 dorothy died of
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
a broken heart according to her daughter
 
02:08:29.109 --> 02:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
because she was not she wasn't even sick
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
at first but
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes were just shut down
 
02:08:35.910 --> 02:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
you could not visit your your loved ones
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
and when finally her vitals went really
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
low they let her daughter come and spend
 
02:08:44.069 --> 02:08:44.079 align:start position:0%
the last couple of days you know fully
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
gowned in ppe
 
02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
with her but like my friend said mama
 
02:08:50.550 --> 02:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
died of a broken heart
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
my sister-in-law in houston who's the
 
02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
was the director of the the jewish
 
02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:56.550 align:start position:0%
was the director of the the jewish
nursing

02:08:56.550 --> 02:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
assisted living which is you know a
 
02:08:59.830 --> 02:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
lovely place
 
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
where mama had lived
 
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
she had 102 year old
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
man resident
 
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
who was fine amazing
 
02:09:12.229 --> 02:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
but then with this extended separation
 
02:09:14.709 --> 02:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
from his family they called her at home
 
02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
it was she happened to be at home when
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
they called her and said his vitals are
 
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
really dropping
 
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
well under the circumstances if they
 
02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:23.599 align:start position:0%
were close to death they would allow the
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
family to come in
 
02:09:25.679 --> 02:09:26.709 align:start position:0%
family to come in
so

02:09:26.709 --> 02:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:26.719 --> 02:09:27.669 align:start position:0%
so
annette

02:09:27.669 --> 02:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
annette
 
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
ordered that
 
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
so the family came in
 
02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
within four hours he was totally
 
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.910 align:start position:0%
within four hours he was totally
recovered

02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
recovered
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:43.750 --> 02:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
i do see that there should be some rules
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
that the hospitals and the nursing homes
 
02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
and all these places should be covered
 
02:09:50.069 --> 02:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
by these rules
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
but i can see that you come up with
 
02:09:53.669 --> 02:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
limitations of how many visitors you
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:59.669 --> 02:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
what what they should be wearing
 
02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
but this has been
 
02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:03.830 align:start position:0%
but this has been
criminal

02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
of and damaging and it has killed people
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have to kill people to
 
02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
mean that it's essential
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the quality of
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
and finally the chair calls teresa
 
02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:21.109 align:start position:0%

02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
as i think you've heard before this bill
 
02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
includes nursing homes because 151 colon
 
02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:44.229 align:start position:0%
includes nursing homes because 151 colon
2

02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
2
 
02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
the facility the licensed facilities
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
statute includes nursing homes if you
 
02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
read the bill it talks about hospitals
 
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
and it talks about nursing homes and not
 
02:10:57.270 --> 02:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
nursing homes health care facilities i
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
think as testified before we need to
 
02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:01.109 align:start position:0%
think as testified before we need to
clarify

02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
02:11:03.430 --> 02:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
with this bill exactly
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
what facilities we're talking about
 
02:11:11.109 --> 02:11:11.119 align:start position:0%
secondly nursing homes are regulated and
 
02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:13.599 align:start position:0%
have visitation guidelines put out by
 
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
cms of the federal government they
 
02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
revised their regulations on november
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
12th of 21
 
02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
and quote visitation allowed for all
 
02:11:25.030 --> 02:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
residents at all times
 
02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:25.910 align:start position:0%
residents at all times
so

02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
with nursing homes now
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
visitation is allowed you can stay as
 
02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
long as you want so i think
 
02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not so sure that we need to be
 
02:11:37.750 --> 02:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
included in this and and more
 
02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
importantly i think as john williams was
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
talking about we need to make sure what
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
we're doing in new hampshire
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
it's not contrary to what people have as
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
rules and regs and they have to abide by
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
to be licensed with the fed so we need
 
02:11:52.069 --> 02:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
to be careful about that
 
02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
so that is really all i have to testify
 
02:11:58.550 --> 02:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:00.550 align:start position:0%
 
question

02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:03.510 align:start position:0%
question
representative

thank you and i'm sorry i had to step
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
out for a moment there but uh
 
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
did you give us written testimony and do
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
you have the site for cms
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
for that i even actually have the
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
document but i'll send it to you if you
 
02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:16.480 align:start position:0%

02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you very much it was

but yes yes she would and that's the
 
02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:53.189 align:start position:0%
but yes yes she would and that's the
story

thank you mr chairman and ladies and
 
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
gentlemen of the committee
 
02:15:52.950 --> 02:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
i am representative donovan fenton and i
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
represent keane
 
02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
i'm here to talk to you about hb 1384
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
which is establishing a committee to
 
02:16:01.350 --> 02:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
study the need for child care and ways
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
to supplement it and fund it in new
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i will be brief because we
 
02:16:06.069 --> 02:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
are talking about a study committee and
 
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
i know how much we all love those
 
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
so i came up with this bill because i
 
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
have a small business and i lost
 
02:16:14.709 --> 02:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
employees during the pandemic i'm proud
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
to say we didn't lose anyone because
 
02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
business was slow but we lost them
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
because they had to stay at home and
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
take care of their children
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
parents can't find or afford child care
 
02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
right now in new hampshire
 
02:16:27.990 --> 02:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
this is the real data right now there's
 
02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
an 87 staff shortage for child care
 
02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:34.559 align:start position:0%
centers and there's a 58 long wait list
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
wages of child care professions are
 
02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
causing recruitment issues which in turn
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
are closing these centers
 
02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
when parents can't find child care for
 
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
their children they turn down job offers
 
02:16:47.190 --> 02:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
and i'll let you know this is a real
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
thing i have my hr department work on
 
02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
locating child care for new employees
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times we can't find any
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
openings and we lose that potential
 
02:16:54.399 --> 02:16:57.830 align:start position:0%
openings and we lose that potential
employee

02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
we need to get these parents back to
 
02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:00.549 align:start position:0%
we need to get these parents back to
work

02:17:00.549 --> 02:17:00.559 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
these are the issues that keep parents
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
out of the workforce and they are the
 
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
backbone to new hampshire's economy
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
my hope for this bill is to study and
 
02:17:08.549 --> 02:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
find creative ways whether it be through
 
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
grants federal funding programs you name
 
02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
it that will help alleviate this issue
 
02:17:14.790 --> 02:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
and this is an issue that's only going
 
02:17:17.349 --> 02:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
to get worse until we address it
 
02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your time and i'll try
 
02:17:20.549 --> 02:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions there were a
 
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
couple of child care experts that were
 
02:17:23.589 --> 02:17:23.599 align:start position:0%
going to testify but they have coveted
 
02:17:25.429 --> 02:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
so they won't be here so
 
02:17:29.509 --> 02:17:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.309 --> 02:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
02:17:39.270 --> 02:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
i have heard and maybe you can confirm
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
this so the question is can you confirm
 
02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:43.599 align:start position:0%
these numbers i've heard because demand
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
and supply
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
is uh is unbalanced right now that some
 
02:17:49.990 --> 02:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
peop some parents are paying as much as
 
02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
1200 a month to send their child to
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
child care
 
02:17:56.309 --> 02:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh thank you for the question
 
02:17:57.910 --> 02:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative i can confirm that
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
because i pay 1100 for one child to go
 
02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else with uh yes
 
02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro thank you mr
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
for taking the question i wholeheartedly
 
02:18:16.309 --> 02:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
agree that this is a serious problem
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
that may not be
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
um answered by the
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
free market and so we have to think
 
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
about how we can
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
make something else happen
 
02:18:29.669 --> 02:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering in terms of
 
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
creating a study committee if you know
 
02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
if this
 
02:18:35.669 --> 02:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
effort to
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
analyze the problem come up with new
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
ideas come up with solutions if this
 
02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
overlaps with any other efforts
 
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
currently going on
 
02:18:45.910 --> 02:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
through state government yeah absolutely
 
02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative
 
02:18:47.359 --> 02:18:48.469 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative
um

02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
dhhs offers a
 
02:18:52.629 --> 02:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
scholarship program for low-income
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
individuals that's a certain program
 
02:18:56.309 --> 02:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
there's also another bill in the senate
 
02:18:58.469 --> 02:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
but i don't presume or assume what the
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
senate does um
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
and i you know this
 
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's a
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
right now we have a band-aid for a
 
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
shotgun wound in my opinion you know
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
these grants these child care
 
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
scholarships they help but
 
02:19:14.309 --> 02:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
this issue is still happening so my hope
 
02:19:15.990 --> 02:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
for this bill is that you know we come
 
02:19:17.910 --> 02:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
out with multiple legislation or one
 
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
great piece of legislation that will fix
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah really my question was
 
02:19:27.669 --> 02:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
not about scholarships or efforts to
 
02:19:27.679 --> 02:19:28.629 align:start position:0%
not about scholarships or efforts to
help

02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:19:28.639 --> 02:19:29.750 align:start position:0%
help
but

02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:19:31.669 --> 02:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
i was talking about if it overlaps with
 
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
other efforts to study the issue
 
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you again for the question there
 
02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
was a similar bill to this uh that got
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
lost in the covid translation um
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
i believe casey cohn representative
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
connolly sponsored it but
 
02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
we all know what happened kind of to a
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
lot of our bills so it's very similar to
 
02:19:48.469 --> 02:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
that but the bill again
 
02:19:48.479 --> 02:19:51.510 align:start position:0%
that but the bill again
disappeared

02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
i have uh
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to try to be a question but
 
02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:57.750 align:start position:0%
it's going to try to be a question but
um

02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
those of us in committee leadership are
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
being told
 
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
by both
 
02:20:05.429 --> 02:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office and senior
 
02:20:07.830 --> 02:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
democratic leaders
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
that we're running out of people to go
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
on these committees i'm one that is
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
regularly asked by the speaker not just
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
for health issues but for numbers of
 
02:20:19.510 --> 02:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
issues to fill committees and i'm
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
finding it getting extremely difficult
 
02:20:24.469 --> 02:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
because people are turning me down
 
02:20:26.790 --> 02:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
either they don't want to do this at
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
this time or they're already doing it in
 
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
five other committees and
 
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
every time i get asked i find it gets
 
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
more and more difficult i hear that from
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
my colleagues on the other side as well
 
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
we are being instructed to kill this
 
02:20:44.550 --> 02:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
bill not because it's your bill and not
 
02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
because it's not needed
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
but because we can't make it happen
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
and my question to you is
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
would it
 
02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:55.510 align:start position:0%
would it
be

02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:20:57.750 --> 02:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
an alternative to
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
grab an ad hoc group of people
 
02:21:02.389 --> 02:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
stakeholders interested parties
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
as well including legislators if you can
 
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
find them and come up with something
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
that would make a wonderful lsr next
 
02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:09.830 align:start position:0%
that would make a wonderful lsr next
summer

02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
summer
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question mr chairman
 
02:21:14.150 --> 02:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
um you know i agree i hate being on
 
02:21:15.429 --> 02:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
study committees especially during the
 
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
summer time um and but i think we're
 
02:21:19.830 --> 02:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
doing a big disservice to our
 
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
constituents um by killing this bill
 
02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
as i said this issue isn't going to go
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
away like an ad hoc is a great idea um
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know i'd be happy to volunteer for
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
the study committee um and i'm sure i
 
02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
can wrangle some other folks too as well
 
02:21:36.150 --> 02:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
but i understand your concerns and i've
 
02:21:37.429 --> 02:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
been told that as well that you know
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
like don't pitch a study committee but
 
02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
02:21:42.469 --> 02:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
you know i don't want to put the cart
 
02:21:43.830 --> 02:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
before the horse and i think a study
 
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
committee is necessary for this such a
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
prevalent issue the question my
 
02:21:50.469 --> 02:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up the question is not is a
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee to study this necessary
 
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
i run a healthcare organization i have
 
02:21:56.640 --> 02:21:57.590 align:start position:0%
i run a healthcare organization i have
health

02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
child care issues a lot with my staff
 
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's very needed the question is what's
 
02:22:06.469 --> 02:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
the best vehicle to do it is it
 
02:22:06.479 --> 02:22:07.429 align:start position:0%
the best vehicle to do it is it
the

02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
three members of the house and three
 
02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
members of the senate
 
02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
or is it a group you can gather together
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
to study it
 
02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
and then bring back some specifics
 
02:22:20.469 --> 02:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
um as early as next
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
fall that's my question only and it's um
 
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
i hope it comes across as an honest
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
question because it is oh no absolutely
 
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
and i completely understand the concerns
 
02:22:31.510 --> 02:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
um my fear for that is
 
02:22:33.429 --> 02:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
a non-mandatory
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
group of people might not always show up
 
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
and might not always be present
 
02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
and it's much easier having the state
 
02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
legislature behind you when you're
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
recruiting these professionals to come
 
02:22:44.950 --> 02:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
in and speak and these experts um you
 
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
know that's why i think the study
 
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
committee is so much more prudent than
 
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc but i i completely understand
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
your concerns um and that is a that's an
 
02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:52.630 align:start position:0%
your concerns um and that is a that's an
issue

02:22:52.630 --> 02:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay this is not a question but kind of
 
02:22:57.429 --> 02:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
a statement sure if the bill passes i'm
 
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
going to hold you to help me i'm going
 
02:23:03.190 --> 02:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh real quick um
 
02:23:10.870 --> 02:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative um
 
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh would you believe that i was on a
 
02:23:14.550 --> 02:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
study committee similar to this about
 
02:23:15.990 --> 02:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
and we uncovered many things that needed
 
02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
to be looked into further
 
02:23:22.710 --> 02:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
and i would also say that in regards to
 
02:23:24.790 --> 02:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc committee there are a lot of
 
02:23:27.190 --> 02:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
people that will volunteer to help you
 
02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
if if you need to pull something like
 
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
that if this doesn't move forward
 
02:23:33.270 --> 02:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
we should communicate there's there's
 
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
activists within the um
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
the community and there's there's a
 
02:23:39.429 --> 02:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
lawyer that represents so there's a lot
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
of smart people out there that want to
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
move forward on this issue so i just
 
02:23:45.030 --> 02:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know that oh no and i
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
again i completely agree the whole the
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
whole reason for the study was just
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
you know to kind of handcuff you to
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
showing up and going you know
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
volunteers are fantastic but i
 
02:23:54.319 --> 02:23:55.110 align:start position:0%
volunteers are fantastic but i
um

02:23:55.110 --> 02:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:56.950 --> 02:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
i've been in positions before where i've
 
02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
had volunteers not show up and i'm just
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
fearful of that
 
02:24:02.950 --> 02:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
but i completely agree
 
02:24:02.960 --> 02:24:04.469 align:start position:0%
but i completely agree
representative

02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:24:04.479 --> 02:24:06.070 align:start position:0%
representative
cushman

02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
cushman
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh would you believe that
 
02:24:13.270 --> 02:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
even on study committees people are not
 
02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
mandated to show up and it's very hard
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
to get a quorum and a lot of times
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
they don't even meet the requirements of
 
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
the rsa because they're not able to get
 
02:24:23.830 --> 02:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
a quorum and finish and publish their
 
02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:25.030 align:start position:0%
a quorum and finish and publish their
reports

02:24:25.030 --> 02:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
reports
 
02:24:26.469 --> 02:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
i would absolutely believe that i've
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
been on study committees during the
 
02:24:30.309 --> 02:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
summer times and they're not fun and
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
some people don't show up
 
02:24:33.830 --> 02:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
and again i'll just echo what i kind of
 
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
said earlier it's uh
 
02:24:36.710 --> 02:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
having the force but with the
 
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
legislature behind this bill means a lot
 
02:24:40.230 --> 02:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
i think and especially to a lot of
 
02:24:42.070 --> 02:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
experts and organizations you know i
 
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
think they
 
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh will play a bigger hand in it um the
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
ad hoc committee is certainly a
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
fantastic idea and i completely agree
 
02:24:50.230 --> 02:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
with that especially if this doesn't
 
02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
pass you know we'd certainly go without
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
it um
 
02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
but like i said i think you know i truly
 
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
believe the study community beneficial
 
02:24:58.870 --> 02:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
however you guys this bill is in your
 
02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
hands so i i'll leave it to you
 
02:25:04.230 --> 02:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you very
 
02:25:07.750 --> 02:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question it's always
 
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:13.990 --> 02:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
is not
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
the point
 
02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:20.230 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:25:20.230 --> 02:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:25:22.830 --> 02:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
members of the public
 
02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
and associations interested in a
 
02:25:28.469 --> 02:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
particular matter
 
02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
get notice of when and where
 
02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
a particularly important matter is to be
 
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
taken up and so
 
02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
it enables the participation of people
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
that we might not think of when creating
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
say a commission or something like that
 
02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
simply because notice is being published
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
in the house calendar
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and yes um
 
02:25:53.830 --> 02:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know they get published in the house
 
02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:54.870 align:start position:0%
you know they get published in the house
calendar

02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh you select a chair um you get regular
 
02:25:59.270 --> 02:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
emails through your legislative email
 
02:26:01.030 --> 02:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
account um
 
02:26:02.790 --> 02:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
some you get paid mileage for which is
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
also fantastic and lucrative um but no
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
no i completely agree and
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
again my
 
02:26:10.469 --> 02:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
i'd really like this to be i really like
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
bipartisan legislation to come out of
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
this bill that's why it's you know it's
 
02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan bill with the study
 
02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
committee the speaker would appoint
 
02:26:18.389 --> 02:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
those members and i think we could get
 
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
some really good bipartisan bills out of
 
02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:27.270 --> 02:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative gay
 
02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:37.030 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative gay
surprise

02:26:37.030 --> 02:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to okay i have a
 
02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:39.750 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to okay i have a
feeling

02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
feeling
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
that this may be the new way to get uh
 
02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
interested parties on committees instead
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
of assigning them have ad hoc committees
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
but also
 
02:26:51.429 --> 02:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
see if
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
we could get them noted no
 
02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
noticed in the calendars because i also
 
02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
sympathize since i want a committee too
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
but i figure
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
like like representative acton said
 
02:27:08.550 --> 02:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
there are people who are interested so
 
02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:09.670 align:start position:0%
there are people who are interested so
hopefully

02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
if we can have that policy that we could
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
get the
 
02:27:15.270 --> 02:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
meetings noticed we could do that and
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
draw the people who are really
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
interested and passionate about it
 
02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative i
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
completely agree and maybe we could ask
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
for volunteers before we start a draft
 
02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you guys
 
02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:47.670 --> 02:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:53.190 --> 02:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that we closed the
 
02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:07.550 --> 02:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on hello house bill
 
02:28:10.630 --> 02:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
1608 requiring the department of health
 
02:28:12.630 --> 02:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
and human services to contact certain
 
02:28:14.950 --> 02:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
individuals whose information was
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
included in the state immunization
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
registry and if you're going to send me

introduce hb
 
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
1608 fn
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
gotta catch my breath
 
02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
i just ran in here okay uh this bill is
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
a follow-up to emergency order 76 issued
 
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
by the governor during the covet 19
 
02:29:45.750 --> 02:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
this order suspended the opt-out
 
02:29:49.349 --> 02:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
provision of the immunization registry
 
02:29:51.910 --> 02:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
for the coven 19 vaccine and made the
 
02:29:53.670 --> 02:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
government collection of data on private
 
02:29:55.990 --> 02:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
citizens mandatory if they wanted to
 
02:29:59.190 --> 02:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
receive the covet 19 vaccine
 
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
the order has expired but the
 
02:30:03.030 --> 02:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
immunization registry retains the data
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
collected that we don't know if the
 
02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
individuals wanted the state to have
 
02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
retaining private data on individuals
 
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
without their consent implicates the
 
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
right to privacy article that the people
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire recently approved with
 
02:30:17.590 --> 02:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
81 percent in favor
 
02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
so this bill tries to find a solution to
 
02:30:21.510 --> 02:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
the problem by having the department of
 
02:30:23.429 --> 02:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
health and human services reach out to
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
individuals and asked and ask them if
 
02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
they want the state to retain their data
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
and in absence of that belated
 
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
permission would eventually delete it
 
02:30:33.750 --> 02:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
while the individuals could submit a
 
02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
form to withdraw their participation
 
02:30:38.070 --> 02:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
is the option to withdraw which almost
 
02:30:40.469 --> 02:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
no one knows about enough
 
02:30:43.270 --> 02:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
the existing dhhs rules suggest it has
 
02:30:46.190 --> 02:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
not been considered enough in the past
 
02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
he-p 307.06
 
02:30:50.950 --> 02:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
is specific that each patient must be
 
02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
made aware of their option to opt out
 
02:30:55.270 --> 02:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
opting out is not an obscure provision
 
02:30:57.270 --> 02:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
of state law and rules that one must
 
02:31:00.309 --> 02:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
know about to exercise we require that
 
02:31:02.550 --> 02:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
they be explicitly asked the question be
 
02:31:04.309 --> 02:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
made aware of the choice
 
02:31:05.910 --> 02:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
we should apply the same standard to
 
02:31:08.230 --> 02:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
this situation and say that an option to
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
withdraw is not that is not widely known
 
02:31:12.070 --> 02:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
is not enough
 
02:31:13.830 --> 02:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
we need to either know that the
 
02:31:15.910 --> 02:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
individual was asked the question
 
02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
provided the opportunity to say no you
 
02:31:20.710 --> 02:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
may not keep my private data and admit
 
02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
that the state has no business retaining
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
their private medical information if we
 
02:31:24.319 --> 02:31:25.590 align:start position:0%
their private medical information if we
don't

02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:31:27.670 --> 02:31:27.680 align:start position:0%

02:33:43.910 --> 02:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
services is in opposition of hb 1608 as
 
02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
the legislation as written is
 
02:33:48.070 --> 02:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
contradictory to current rules and puts
 
02:33:50.469 --> 02:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
patient safety at risk as we continue to
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
navigate the unpredictable turbulence of
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
the deadly pandemic
 
02:33:57.030 --> 02:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
under emergency order number 76 the
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire acted as a
 
02:34:00.389 --> 02:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
medical provider
 
02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
through the issuance of a standing order
 
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
for the administration of covet 19
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
vaccines at our state-run sites
 
02:34:09.030 --> 02:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
as such vaccine recipient information
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
was collected in a manner similar to
 
02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
vaccination in a primary care provider
 
02:34:17.349 --> 02:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
office pharmacy or other location
 
02:34:19.590 --> 02:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
as this is not a typical function of the
 
02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
department and the agency does not have
 
02:34:23.670 --> 02:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
an electronic medical record
 
02:34:26.950 --> 02:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
the state's iis was used in the same
 
02:34:29.349 --> 02:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
fashion as an electronic medical record
 
02:34:32.389 --> 02:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
to document vaccine administration
 
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire board of medicine
 
02:34:36.070 --> 02:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
rules state the licensee shall retain a
 
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
complete copy of all patient medical
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
records for at least seven years from
 
02:34:42.870 --> 02:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
the date of the patient's last contact
 
02:34:45.670 --> 02:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
with a licensee unless before that date
 
02:34:47.670 --> 02:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
the patient has requested that the file
 
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
be transferred to another health care
 
02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:50.630 align:start position:0%
be transferred to another health care
provider

02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
provider
 
02:34:52.309 --> 02:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
based on the board of medicine rules
 
02:34:53.910 --> 02:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation would
 
02:34:56.389 --> 02:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
contradict the obligation of a provider
 
02:34:56.399 --> 02:34:57.190 align:start position:0%
contradict the obligation of a provider
to

02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
preserve the standard of documentation
 
02:35:02.070 --> 02:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
of the vaccine administration
 
02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
this information should not be removed
 
02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
for the iis
 
02:35:08.309 --> 02:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
as is proposed by this bill as there is
 
02:35:12.150 --> 02:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
no other record of documentation
 
02:35:14.790 --> 02:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
hb 1608 would require the department to
 
02:35:16.469 --> 02:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
contact individuals who were not given
 
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to opt out of having
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
their coveted vaccine information
 
02:35:22.389 --> 02:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
included in the state's registry
 
02:35:24.870 --> 02:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
there were approximately 790 000
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
individuals immunized prior to the
 
02:35:29.270 --> 02:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
expiration of this emergency order on
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
june 11 2021.
 
02:35:33.510 --> 02:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
our analysis provided in the fiscal note
 
02:35:36.389 --> 02:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
worksheet for hb 1608
 
02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
outlined a breakdown of costs and
 
02:35:41.510 --> 02:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
logistical challenges of implementation
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill does not
 
02:35:45.349 --> 02:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
specify a method of contact but
 
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of which method is preferred
 
02:35:49.030 --> 02:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
the department would need to hire
 
02:35:51.030 --> 02:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
additional personnel to make phone calls
 
02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
and or mail letters
 
02:35:55.349 --> 02:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
and based on the existing contract
 
02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
with a call center the department
 
02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
estimates it would send spend an
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
estimated 6.2 million dollars over the
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
course of the six-month period proposed
 
02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
by this legislation to reach 790 000
 
02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:08.870 align:start position:0%
by this legislation to reach 790 000
residents

02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
residents
 
02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's estimated that the cost of postage
 
02:36:13.110 --> 02:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
and staffing needed to mail the letters
 
02:36:14.950 --> 02:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
to each household would exceed eight
 
02:36:16.950 --> 02:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
02:36:18.950 --> 02:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
not included in this fiscal impact
 
02:36:21.429 --> 02:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
analysis are the expenses anticipated to
 
02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
be incurred in order to manually remove
 
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
the information from the iis
 
02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
the department would need to pay for
 
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
staffing beyond six months in order to
 
02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
complete the removal process of those
 
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
who were not
 
02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
reached and did not respond to the
 
02:36:36.550 --> 02:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
attempts to contact
 
02:36:38.630 --> 02:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
the anticipated cost of staffing this
 
02:36:40.950 --> 02:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
part of the project is two hundred sixty
 
02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
seven thousand dollars for every one
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand names being removed
 
02:36:46.630 --> 02:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
from the iis
 
02:36:49.349 --> 02:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
it's also estimated to take at least six
 
02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
thousand six hundred seventy five hours
 
02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
to delete one hundred thousand records
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
if this legislation becomes law the
 
02:36:59.190 --> 02:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
department would need staffing resources
 
02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
and additional time to complete this
 
02:37:03.990 --> 02:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
project the department estimates 45
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
staff members working full time for one
 
02:37:09.349 --> 02:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
month would be required for each 100 000
 
02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
records deleted
 
02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
while the actual number of records to be
 
02:37:16.630 --> 02:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
removed is indeterminable the department
 
02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
anticipates a high number of
 
02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.670 align:start position:0%
anticipates a high number of
non-respondents

02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
non-respondents
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
this could be as high as 78 percent
 
02:37:23.349 --> 02:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
based on the department's experience
 
02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
with other outbound call initiatives
 
02:37:29.429 --> 02:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
we tried to contact 46
 
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
104 vaccine recipients to verify the
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
information after multiple attempts to
 
02:37:37.429 --> 02:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
contact our overall response rate was
 
02:37:39.590 --> 02:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
22.5 percent
 
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
reasons for low response may include
 
02:37:44.070 --> 02:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
incorrect contact information due to
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
change of address or phone number phones
 
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
being disconnected and ignoring attempts
 
02:37:50.790 --> 02:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
to contact due to the concerns that the
 
02:37:53.190 --> 02:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
outreach was a scam
 
02:37:55.590 --> 02:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
if this effort produces a similar low
 
02:37:56.950 --> 02:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
response rate
 
02:37:59.349 --> 02:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
it's estimated that the cost could could
 
02:38:01.750 --> 02:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
easily jump up to 1.6 million dollars to
 
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
remove more than 600 000 names
 
02:38:06.870 --> 02:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to become law
 
02:38:08.950 --> 02:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
funds to cover both the contacting of
 
02:38:10.630 --> 02:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
the recipients and removal of the
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
records would need to be made through an
 
02:38:15.429 --> 02:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
additional appropriation
 
02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just the challenges of
 
02:38:18.790 --> 02:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
implementing this bill and the financial
 
02:38:21.510 --> 02:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
burden it presents but we also oppose
 
02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 1608 because it would give
 
02:38:25.910 --> 02:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
the state the authority to arrest erase
 
02:38:27.910 --> 02:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination information if after three
 
02:38:30.070 --> 02:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
attempts to contact an individual
 
02:38:32.469 --> 02:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
results in the non-response
 
02:38:37.349 --> 02:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
under administrative rule hep 307 o6 the
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
choice to opt out is sole responsibility
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
of the patient
 
02:38:43.830 --> 02:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
not the decision of the state
 
02:38:46.389 --> 02:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
this bill assumes a non-response equals
 
02:38:48.790 --> 02:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
consent when in fact there is no
 
02:38:51.270 --> 02:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
informed consent if a patient is unable
 
02:38:52.950 --> 02:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
to be contacted
 
02:38:55.270 --> 02:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
this goes against patient privacy and
 
02:38:57.270 --> 02:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
the standard of patient care that people
 
02:39:00.790 --> 02:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
currently when individuals receive a
 
02:39:04.950 --> 02:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
vaccination from the state and choose to
 
02:39:07.110 --> 02:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
opt out of the registry their vaccine
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
information is recorded on paper
 
02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
as the opportunity to opt out was
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
suspended under the emergency order no
 
02:39:16.630 --> 02:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
option of a paper record was provided
 
02:39:18.950 --> 02:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
this will be problematic for individuals
 
02:39:21.110 --> 02:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
for whom all data will be deleted by
 
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation
 
02:39:25.590 --> 02:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
if that individual loses his or her
 
02:39:28.469 --> 02:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
vaccination card this is the only hard
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
copy of their record they will have no
 
02:39:32.550 --> 02:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
proof of vaccination because they no
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
longer exist in the registry
 
02:39:38.550 --> 02:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
their information is irretrievable
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
the department is receiving calls
 
02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:42.070 align:start position:0%
the department is receiving calls
emails

02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
emails
 
02:39:43.990 --> 02:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
daily from people who are asking how
 
02:39:46.630 --> 02:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
they can replace their vaccination card
 
02:39:49.110 --> 02:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
fortunately this is a simple process for
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
those who can choose to keep their
 
02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
information in the registry
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
they can not only replace the card but
 
02:39:57.590 --> 02:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
they can also don download a copy of the
 
02:39:59.270 --> 02:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination record through the patient
 
02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:00.309 align:start position:0%

who received the vaccine prior to june
 
02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
11th the ias was used in the same
 
02:41:27.510 --> 02:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
fashion as the emr removing these
 
02:41:29.429 --> 02:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
records now would have a significant
 
02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact and more importantly would
 
02:41:33.429 --> 02:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
place patient safety at risk by
 
02:41:35.190 --> 02:41:35.200 align:start position:0%

02:41:38.630 --> 02:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
02:41:40.710 --> 02:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
speak today i'm happy to answer any
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
02:41:46.389 --> 02:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:48.309 --> 02:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
thank you i missed the number of people
 
02:41:50.469 --> 02:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
who had asked to opt out and i wonder if
 
02:41:53.429 --> 02:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
you had written testimony and if so has
 
02:41:53.439 --> 02:41:54.389 align:start position:0%
you had written testimony and if so has
it

02:41:54.389 --> 02:41:54.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:41:56.150 --> 02:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
is are there any extras anywhere that
 
02:41:58.469 --> 02:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
anybody sees because i missed one
 
02:42:00.630 --> 02:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you the testimony was emailed to
 
02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
you as well this morning oh okay thank
 
02:42:02.399 --> 02:42:04.150 align:start position:0%
you as well this morning oh okay thank
you

02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:42:07.429 --> 02:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
02:42:09.349 --> 02:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:42:11.269 --> 02:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:42:12.389 --> 02:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
in the beginning your testimony you
 
02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this would be a threat to
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
patients can you elaborate on that a bit
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
more please sure well if these records
 
02:42:20.870 --> 02:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
are removed they will not have any
 
02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
record in existence during the emergency
 
02:42:25.670 --> 02:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
order because it was suspended we used
 
02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
the ias as their electronic medical
 
02:42:29.910 --> 02:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
record therefore we collected the
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
information that was needed for
 
02:42:33.110 --> 02:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
documenting the vaccine
 
02:42:35.910 --> 02:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
in the iis if a patient should need to
 
02:42:38.309 --> 02:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
have their record after it's removed or
 
02:42:40.150 --> 02:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
if we needed to contact them for any
 
02:42:40.160 --> 02:42:41.269 align:start position:0%
if we needed to contact them for any
reason

02:42:41.269 --> 02:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
reason
 
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
so if there was any information that
 
02:42:45.510 --> 02:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
came up about a specific lot number or
 
02:42:47.269 --> 02:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
recall we would not have that
 
02:42:49.190 --> 02:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
information to be able to give to the to
 
02:42:51.670 --> 02:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
the person in addition if anyone needed
 
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
their record for subsequent doses they
 
02:42:55.429 --> 02:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
would not have that record to
 
02:42:57.190 --> 02:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
demonstrate what their minimal time
 
02:42:59.030 --> 02:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
intervals between dosing would be
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
because that record would not be in
 
02:43:03.030 --> 02:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
existence so therefore any provider who
 
02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
goes to give subsequent doses is not
 
02:43:07.030 --> 02:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
going to be able to find their record of
 
02:43:09.269 --> 02:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
previous doses unless that person kept
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
that one piece of paper that was
 
02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
provided to them at the time of
 
02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.230 align:start position:0%
provided to them at the time of
vaccination

02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
02:43:17.269 --> 02:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:19.190 --> 02:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
are you willing to accept that that some
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
people may be scared of getting their
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
name on those lists giving the the
 
02:43:24.630 --> 02:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
rather vicious treatment of unvaccinated
 
02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
we have people getting put in intern
 
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
internment camps in australia we have
 
02:43:31.110 --> 02:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
people right in
 
02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
a few hours to the north of us and
 
02:43:34.150 --> 02:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
canada being denied
 
02:43:36.469 --> 02:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
entry into food stores
 
02:43:38.630 --> 02:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
because of their vaccine status even if
 
02:43:40.389 --> 02:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
they're masked or not
 
02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
are you willing to accept that
 
02:43:45.510 --> 02:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
i think that the failure to keep these
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
records is more hazardous than having
 
02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
the information in but we also do agree
 
02:43:53.230 --> 02:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
that people should have the
 
02:43:55.349 --> 02:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility and ownership of having
 
02:43:57.349 --> 02:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
that information it is their information
 
02:43:59.590 --> 02:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
to have if they should choose to
 
02:44:01.110 --> 02:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
withdraw their information we would be
 
02:44:02.870 --> 02:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
happy to assist them with that and that
 
02:44:04.790 --> 02:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
process is fairly simple to go ahead and
 
02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:05.910 align:start position:0%
process is fairly simple to go ahead and
do

02:44:05.910 --> 02:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:44:07.750 --> 02:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
we are getting the information out more
 
02:44:09.190 --> 02:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
and more about
 
02:44:11.750 --> 02:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
opt-out about the ability to withdraw so
 
02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
people do have the right to go ahead and
 
02:44:15.349 --> 02:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
do that they would just need to know
 
02:44:15.359 --> 02:44:16.389 align:start position:0%
do that they would just need to know
that

02:44:16.389 --> 02:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
they would need to transfer the record
 
02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
to their health care provider or they
 
02:44:22.870 --> 02:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
would need to keep their copy
 
02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
what we do want to prohibit or
 
02:44:28.550 --> 02:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
make difficult would be the arbitrary
 
02:44:31.030 --> 02:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
removal of the vaccination records of
 
02:44:32.790 --> 02:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
those people who were not able to be
 
02:44:35.510 --> 02:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
contacted so this legislation if after
 
02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
six months they were unreached we would
 
02:44:40.630 --> 02:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
be required to remove those records and
 
02:44:42.230 --> 02:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
and that would be a significant problem
 
02:44:43.830 --> 02:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
for those people who just were not aware
 
02:44:45.469 --> 02:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
that their record was being
 
02:44:52.469 --> 02:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:44:56.469 --> 02:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:44:59.110 --> 02:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um just so that
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'm clear this database is separate then
 
02:45:03.750 --> 02:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
like a pharmacy a pharmacy database
 
02:45:05.269 --> 02:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
where somebody would get their
 
02:45:07.269 --> 02:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
immunization from
 
02:45:07.279 --> 02:45:08.150 align:start position:0%
immunization from
so

02:45:08.150 --> 02:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:45:10.150 --> 02:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
would the pharmacy then not have that
 
02:45:12.870 --> 02:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
information if they lost their card
 
02:45:14.710 --> 02:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy would have that information
 
02:45:17.269 --> 02:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
only if they accessed it through the ias
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
i see the far
 
02:45:20.309 --> 02:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
i should correct that
 
02:45:23.429 --> 02:45:23.439 align:start position:0%
if a location such as a pharmacy had
 
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
their own record
 
02:45:26.550 --> 02:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
and they were not connecting that
 
02:45:28.630 --> 02:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
information to the is the pharmacy would
 
02:45:30.630 --> 02:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead and do that under the emergency
 
02:45:33.030 --> 02:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
order the majority of the people who
 
02:45:35.030 --> 02:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
were vaccinated were vaccinated at
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
state-run sites they were not vaccinated
 
02:45:39.750 --> 02:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
at another location so therefore those
 
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
records don't exist elsewhere if you
 
02:45:43.590 --> 02:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
were vaccinated in your primary care
 
02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:44.550 align:start position:0%

if you were vaccinated in a pharmacy
 
02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
those locations should maintain your
 
02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
record separately from the iis thank you
 
02:45:54.550 --> 02:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:57.830 --> 02:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
02:45:59.429 --> 02:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
as a person who
 
02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
has been stung
 
02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:01.910 align:start position:0%
has been stung
by

02:46:01.910 --> 02:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:46:04.150 --> 02:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
email and telephone requests for
 
02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:05.429 align:start position:0%
email and telephone requests for
information

02:46:05.429 --> 02:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:46:05.439 --> 02:46:06.150 align:start position:0%
information
or

02:46:06.150 --> 02:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:46:08.150 --> 02:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
response on something
 
02:46:10.389 --> 02:46:10.399 align:start position:0%
i automatically don't pay the attention
 
02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
i just hang up on the call and don't pay
 
02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
any attention whatsoever to the record
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i have a feeling that a lot of the
 
02:46:18.630 --> 02:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
people who
 
02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
might wish to have their records
 
02:46:20.399 --> 02:46:22.070 align:start position:0%
might wish to have their records
maintained

02:46:22.070 --> 02:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
maintained
 
02:46:23.910 --> 02:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
are going to lose out on the opportunity
 
02:46:25.670 --> 02:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
to do that because
 
02:46:27.429 --> 02:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
like me they don't want to get
 
02:46:29.670 --> 02:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
into another situation where somebody's
 
02:46:32.630 --> 02:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
after the other information and
 
02:46:34.870 --> 02:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
got some money i had my i had my entire
 
02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
computer system shut down once because
 
02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
good call like this and the demand for a
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
huge amount of money which fortunately i
 
02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
was able to get out from under but it
 
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
was a terrible ordeal and now i just
 
02:46:47.670 --> 02:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
refuse to do and i think there's a lot
 
02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
of people out there just like me who are
 
02:46:52.309 --> 02:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
doing that so i think it's foolish to
 
02:46:54.309 --> 02:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
assume you're going to have any good
 
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
outcome you're going to have a whole lot
 
02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
of people that just won't respond you're
 
02:46:59.110 --> 02:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
going to end off the list and then
 
02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to be done mad
 
02:47:03.510 --> 02:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
that they thought they had a record
 
02:47:05.429 --> 02:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
that they were free and if they have to
 
02:47:07.990 --> 02:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
get kicked out of a drug store or a
 
02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
grocery store they assume they had a
 
02:47:12.150 --> 02:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
record and they don't have one
 
02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:13.510 align:start position:0%
record and they don't have one
and

02:47:13.510 --> 02:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
anyway enough sad that was good
 
02:47:18.790 --> 02:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a question but you can
 
02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
respond to it i'm sorry oh that's all
 
02:47:22.710 --> 02:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
right i know what you meant would you
 
02:47:25.030 --> 02:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
believe i know you meant that
 
02:47:26.950 --> 02:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your comment we
 
02:47:29.030 --> 02:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
would agree based on our experience
 
02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
we've only had about a 22 response rate
 
02:47:33.670 --> 02:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
so therefore we feel as though
 
02:47:36.150 --> 02:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
approximately 600 000 people would be
 
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
having their records deleted arbitrarily
 
02:47:39.750 --> 02:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
by this law
 
02:47:41.510 --> 02:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
so that would be great significance
 
02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
especially if an individual needed their
 
02:47:47.190 --> 02:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
vaccination proof record for
 
02:47:48.710 --> 02:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
for their work
 
02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:55.190 align:start position:0%
you know
representatives

02:47:55.190 --> 02:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:47:58.710 --> 02:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:47:58.720 --> 02:47:59.590 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:47:59.590 --> 02:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:01.349 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:48:01.349 --> 02:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:03.269 --> 02:48:03.279 align:start position:0%
my question is do you
 
02:48:05.269 --> 02:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable
 
02:48:08.710 --> 02:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
um would the department be amenable to
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
changing the bill to make it so that one
 
02:48:11.439 --> 02:48:12.389 align:start position:0%
changing the bill to make it so that one
letter

02:48:12.389 --> 02:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
letter
 
02:48:15.510 --> 02:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
is sent to everyone who had their
 
02:48:18.309 --> 02:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
information entered into the system and
 
02:48:20.309 --> 02:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
informing them that they have a right to
 
02:48:23.110 --> 02:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
withdraw their information
 
02:48:24.550 --> 02:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
so that they are presented and you know
 
02:48:26.790 --> 02:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
that it goes to each individual
 
02:48:28.630 --> 02:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
we could go ahead and do the letter but
 
02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
once again the information that we have
 
02:48:34.230 --> 02:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
at the state is only as accurate as what
 
02:48:36.309 --> 02:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
was provided us at the time that they
 
02:48:38.870 --> 02:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
were vaccinated if someone moves they
 
02:48:41.190 --> 02:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily
 
02:48:43.110 --> 02:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
meet that does not necessarily translate
 
02:48:44.950 --> 02:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
to they received
 
02:48:47.349 --> 02:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
the letter and i guess my question would
 
02:48:49.030 --> 02:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
be i'm not sure exactly what you're
 
02:48:51.110 --> 02:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
asking to have in the letter or if we
 
02:48:53.190 --> 02:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
would automatically
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
withdraw people if there was a
 
02:48:56.710 --> 02:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
non-respondent so i would have to have a
 
02:48:59.670 --> 02:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more clarity on that
 
02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:49:01.990 --> 02:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:49:03.429 --> 02:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:49:05.830 --> 02:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
the the letter could say you know what
 
02:49:08.389 --> 02:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill says except it
 
02:49:09.429 --> 02:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
could say
 
02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh indicate
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know below if you would like to have
 
02:49:14.630 --> 02:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
your information withdrawn
 
02:49:15.910 --> 02:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:49:17.830 --> 02:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
you could withdraw it if you receive the
 
02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:18.790 align:start position:0%
you could withdraw it if you receive the
letter

02:49:18.790 --> 02:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
letter
 
02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:49:24.830 --> 02:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
and my follow-up question is
 
02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh oh um so
 
02:49:29.269 --> 02:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
we have a constitutional right in the
 
02:49:31.190 --> 02:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire to privacy and
 
02:49:33.590 --> 02:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
our constitutional right was
 
02:49:36.389 --> 02:49:36.399 align:start position:0%
sort of unconstitutionally removed and
 
02:49:39.269 --> 02:49:39.279 align:start position:0%
this information was taken from people
 
02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
without the opportunity to opt out and
 
02:49:44.230 --> 02:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
that's question of the constitutionality
 
02:49:47.590 --> 02:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
and legality of that is questionable and
 
02:49:50.309 --> 02:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
so i think that
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
every attempt like sending a letter even
 
02:49:55.190 --> 02:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
if all of the information is just as
 
02:49:56.870 --> 02:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
accurate as it was
 
02:49:59.590 --> 02:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
when you know the addresses as when the
 
02:50:03.190 --> 02:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
people received the vaccination is still
 
02:50:04.950 --> 02:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know something that the state should
 
02:50:07.030 --> 02:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
do would you agree
 
02:50:08.550 --> 02:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the interest of privacy and
 
02:50:12.950 --> 02:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:15.030 --> 02:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
i saw you gearing up
 
02:50:16.550 --> 02:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative
 
02:50:18.710 --> 02:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
cushman i just wanted to reiterate that
 
02:50:22.550 --> 02:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
through emergency order 76 dhs ghhs had
 
02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
executed a data sharing agreement with
 
02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
the cdc to protect any identifiable data
 
02:50:30.389 --> 02:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
and the identifiable data
 
02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
was made available to the cdc and other
 
02:50:33.910 --> 02:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
agencies for
 
02:50:36.870 --> 02:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
reconciling and tracking the covet 19
 
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination um and we certainly were
 
02:50:43.030 --> 02:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
very um uh stringent about preserving
 
02:50:44.230 --> 02:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
and protecting
 
02:50:46.950 --> 02:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
personal health information um as far as
 
02:50:49.750 --> 02:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
your question goes um again as ann
 
02:50:52.150 --> 02:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
um stated it will be difficult to to
 
02:50:53.429 --> 02:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
send a letter it wouldn't be difficult
 
02:50:55.110 --> 02:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
to send a letter but we couldn't we
 
02:50:56.710 --> 02:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't guarantee that everybody that
 
02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
we sent the letter to based on the
 
02:50:59.349 --> 02:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
limited information that we were given
 
02:51:01.750 --> 02:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
at the time of vaccination um would be
 
02:51:03.429 --> 02:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
received and responded to and we still
 
02:51:05.910 --> 02:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for then um you
 
02:51:07.510 --> 02:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
know removing information from someone
 
02:51:09.349 --> 02:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
who didn't either receive the letter or
 
02:51:13.750 --> 02:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have a chance to to um to respond
 
02:51:30.590 --> 02:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:30.600 --> 02:51:32.389 align:start position:0%
 
emergency

02:51:32.389 --> 02:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
02:51:32.399 --> 02:51:51.750 align:start position:0%
emergency
um

02:51:51.750 --> 02:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:53.590 --> 02:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
to outreach we do have a withdrawal
 
02:51:55.349 --> 02:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
process in place currently and that
 
02:51:57.349 --> 02:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
information is available on our website
 
02:51:58.790 --> 02:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
um i think we would have to look at
 
02:52:00.230 --> 02:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
again we could amend our fiscal note to
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
see what that would cost us to be aware
 
02:52:03.269 --> 02:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
of that but i think we could have
 
02:52:05.349 --> 02:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
further conversations about that thank
 
02:52:05.359 --> 02:52:05.990 align:start position:0%
further conversations about that thank
you

02:52:05.990 --> 02:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:52:07.990 --> 02:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
02:52:09.590 --> 02:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:52:11.590 --> 02:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
the question uh with this i would like
 
02:52:14.550 --> 02:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
to clarify that you would be we could
 
02:52:17.110 --> 02:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
talk about having an amendment where it
 
02:52:18.710 --> 02:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
would clarify that it's providing that
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
withdrawal language that you already
 
02:52:23.190 --> 02:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
have one time to the best information
 
02:52:25.349 --> 02:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
that's available on your records nobody
 
02:52:27.429 --> 02:52:27.439 align:start position:0%
would be withdrawn but doing this as a
 
02:52:29.830 --> 02:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
specific targeted outreach would that be
 
02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
something to discuss
 
02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
i think that we would be open to that
 
02:52:37.590 --> 02:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of sending a single letter was
 
02:52:40.070 --> 02:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
just over eight hundred thousand dollars
 
02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
so if state appropriations were made
 
02:52:44.070 --> 02:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
available to us we could go ahead for
 
02:52:46.469 --> 02:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
the informational purposes of letting
 
02:52:48.070 --> 02:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
people know that they have the right to
 
02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:49.510 align:start position:0%
people know that they have the right to
withdraw

02:52:49.510 --> 02:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
withdraw
 
02:52:51.510 --> 02:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
the concern once again would be if we
 
02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
were forced to withdraw if there's a
 
02:52:54.160 --> 02:52:59.670 align:start position:0%
were forced to withdraw if there's a
non-respondents

02:52:59.670 --> 02:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:01.349 --> 02:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:53:03.190 --> 02:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:53:04.710 --> 02:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:53:06.870 --> 02:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
um i have two two questions so i'll ask
 
02:53:08.230 --> 02:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
them together and you can answer them
 
02:53:09.429 --> 02:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
how you like
 
02:53:14.230 --> 02:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
what data besides which shots people had
 
02:53:16.309 --> 02:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
do you need
 
02:53:16.319 --> 02:53:17.429 align:start position:0%
do you need
for

02:53:17.429 --> 02:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:53:17.439 --> 02:53:19.110 align:start position:0%
for
analysis

02:53:19.110 --> 02:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
02:53:22.389 --> 02:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
and the other is specifically
 
02:53:24.389 --> 02:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
how do you
 
02:53:28.790 --> 02:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:30.389 --> 02:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very very much for that
 
02:53:32.070 --> 02:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
question so the information that is
 
02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
obtained with the vaccination would be
 
02:53:37.190 --> 02:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
similarly to when you're receiving a
 
02:53:39.190 --> 02:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine in your doctor's office so
 
02:53:40.710 --> 02:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
they're asking your demographic
 
02:53:40.720 --> 02:53:42.469 align:start position:0%
they're asking your demographic
information

02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:53:44.469 --> 02:53:44.479 align:start position:0%
whether you've had any contra
 
02:53:47.429 --> 02:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
indications to receiving the vaccination
 
02:53:49.429 --> 02:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
so that we could administer that vaccine
 
02:53:49.439 --> 02:53:50.550 align:start position:0%
so that we could administer that vaccine
safely

02:53:50.550 --> 02:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
safely
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
it also gives us the dates of those
 
02:53:53.670 --> 02:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines so that we can look at the
 
02:53:55.590 --> 02:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
minimal intervals
 
02:53:57.590 --> 02:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that subsequent doses are
 
02:53:59.510 --> 02:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
administered at proper times for the
 
02:53:59.520 --> 02:54:01.030 align:start position:0%
administered at proper times for the
most

02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
most
 
02:54:03.429 --> 02:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
efficacious dosing
 
02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
as far as your second question
 
02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
um please repeat because i'm in the
 
02:54:12.230 --> 02:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
moment listening to you
 
02:54:15.030 --> 02:54:15.040 align:start position:0%

that is in
 
02:54:27.269 --> 02:54:27.279 align:start position:0%
under our administrative rules to be
 
02:54:30.790 --> 02:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
able to withdraw from the iis it simply
 
02:54:32.710 --> 02:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
is stating that you wish to have your
 
02:54:34.550 --> 02:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
information withdrawn
 
02:54:36.870 --> 02:54:36.880 align:start position:0%

good morning mr chairman members of the
 
02:56:22.150 --> 02:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
committee again my name is paula minihan
 
02:56:23.590 --> 02:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
senior vice president state government
 
02:56:24.870 --> 02:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
relations new hampshire hospital
 
02:56:26.150 --> 02:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
association representing all our
 
02:56:28.710 --> 02:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the state we are opposed to
 
02:56:31.110 --> 02:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
hb 1608
 
02:56:32.550 --> 02:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
and there are a number of problems with
 
02:56:33.590 --> 02:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
there are there were many emergency
 
02:56:37.750 --> 02:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
orders issued by the governor during the
 
02:56:40.870 --> 02:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
state of emergency declared on march 13
 
02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:42.230 align:start position:0%
state of emergency declared on march 13
2020

02:56:42.230 --> 02:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
2020
 
02:56:44.469 --> 02:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
there were a total of 90 emergency
 
02:56:46.469 --> 02:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
orders that were issued subsequent to
 
02:56:48.550 --> 02:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
the declaration and imagine if all those
 
02:56:50.309 --> 02:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
emergency orders were subsequently
 
02:56:51.990 --> 02:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
reviewed questioned resulted in
 
02:56:54.790 --> 02:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
legislation to challenge the decision
 
02:56:56.469 --> 02:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
made during the state of emergency we
 
02:56:58.950 --> 02:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
would be we contend that this would
 
02:57:00.630 --> 02:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
cause chaos
 
02:57:02.550 --> 02:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
we were under a state of emergency and
 
02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
actions were taken to protect the
 
02:57:06.309 --> 02:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire including
 
02:57:09.190 --> 02:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
obtaining life-saving covid19 vaccines
 
02:57:10.870 --> 02:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
from the federal government
 
02:57:13.030 --> 02:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
and as stated in the fiscal note drafted
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
by dhhs there were approximately not 790
 
02:57:18.630 --> 02:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
individuals that chose to obtain a
 
02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:19.910 align:start position:0%
individuals that chose to obtain a
vaccine

02:57:19.910 --> 02:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:57:22.790 --> 02:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
during this that time that was in place
 
02:57:24.950 --> 02:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the cdc the federal
 
02:57:27.110 --> 02:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
agency responsible for issuing vaccines
 
02:57:29.190 --> 02:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
to states was to ensure that the
 
02:57:31.030 --> 02:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
individuals receiving the vaccine be
 
02:57:33.030 --> 02:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
included in the registry for safety and
 
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
efficacy reasons
 
02:57:37.190 --> 02:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
using the vaccine registry to document
 
02:57:39.590 --> 02:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines administered to individuals can
 
02:57:42.309 --> 02:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
help to keep patient vaccination data
 
02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
records to date and give all medical
 
02:57:46.870 --> 02:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
providers that care for patients across
 
02:57:49.030 --> 02:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
to access to complete and accurate
 
02:57:50.230 --> 02:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
information about the patient's
 
02:57:52.070 --> 02:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
immunization record as
 
02:57:55.110 --> 02:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
indicated by anne-marie and um and abby
 
02:57:56.469 --> 02:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
from the department
 
02:57:58.550 --> 02:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
from a practical perspective requiring
 
02:58:00.309 --> 02:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
dhhs to reach out to all these
 
02:58:02.790 --> 02:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
individuals that received the cobia 19
 
02:58:04.710 --> 02:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
during vaccine during the state of
 
02:58:07.030 --> 02:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
emergency time period to ask if they
 
02:58:09.030 --> 02:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
want to opt out for the registry is
 
02:58:10.870 --> 02:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
simply impractical and very time
 
02:58:13.269 --> 02:58:13.279 align:start position:0%
consuming not to mention expensive we
 
02:58:15.030 --> 02:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
should not be expending limited state
 
02:58:17.030 --> 02:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
resources on this effort
 
02:58:19.190 --> 02:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
from a clinical perspective a complete
 
02:58:21.750 --> 02:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine vaccine registry is an important
 
02:58:23.269 --> 02:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
tool to ensure that health care
 
02:58:25.349 --> 02:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
providers have access to a patient's
 
02:58:27.670 --> 02:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
full vaccination history to make
 
02:58:29.510 --> 02:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
informed clinical decisions for their
 
02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
patients for these reasons we are
 
02:58:33.830 --> 02:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill and on behalf of
 
02:58:35.590 --> 02:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
our hospitals we urge you to find this
 
02:58:37.510 --> 02:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate thank you for
 
02:58:39.670 --> 02:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
02:58:43.670 --> 02:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:46.469 --> 02:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
representative soloway thank you mr
 
02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
chairman miss millehan it's nice to see
 
02:58:51.510 --> 02:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
you nice to see you again
 
02:58:54.469 --> 02:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
um would you believe
 
02:58:57.510 --> 02:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
that there has in fact a study been done
 
02:58:59.110 --> 02:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
in another state
 
02:59:00.950 --> 02:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
of the efficacy
 
02:59:04.870 --> 02:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
of tracing vaccine recipients
 
02:59:08.550 --> 02:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
and using that data to make policy
 
02:59:08.560 --> 02:59:10.150 align:start position:0%
and using that data to make policy
decisions

02:59:10.150 --> 02:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:59:13.910 --> 02:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
that research which is not yet published
 
02:59:18.469 --> 02:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
and whose author i cannot name i regret
 
02:59:20.469 --> 02:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
but will be published i will guarantee
 
02:59:20.479 --> 02:59:21.830 align:start position:0%
but will be published i will guarantee
you

02:59:21.830 --> 02:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:59:25.349 --> 02:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
indicates that the effort on the part of
 
02:59:27.590 --> 02:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
a state government i won't identify the
 
02:59:27.600 --> 02:59:30.150 align:start position:0%
a state government i won't identify the
state

02:59:30.150 --> 02:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:33.510 --> 02:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
was it produced totally completely and
 
02:59:36.469 --> 02:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
utterly dirty data
 
02:59:36.479 --> 02:59:37.750 align:start position:0%
utterly dirty data
because

02:59:37.750 --> 02:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:59:38.950 --> 02:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:59:42.710 --> 02:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
impossible to contact people telephone
 
02:59:45.030 --> 02:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
numbers were inaccurate addresses were
 
02:59:48.309 --> 02:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
inaccurate people declined to respond
 
02:59:51.990 --> 02:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
and the individuals collecting the data
 
02:59:54.070 --> 02:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
fudged it
 
02:59:54.080 --> 02:59:55.110 align:start position:0%
fudged it
and

02:59:55.110 --> 02:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:59:58.630 --> 02:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
the completed quote-unquote dirty data
 
03:00:00.870 --> 03:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
then went to state government with
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
directives to create policy based on the
 
03:00:04.560 --> 03:00:05.670 align:start position:0%
directives to create policy based on the
data

03:00:05.670 --> 03:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
data
 
03:00:05.680 --> 03:00:06.630 align:start position:0%
data
and

03:00:06.630 --> 03:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:00:09.190 --> 03:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
they went to the media with false and
 
03:00:13.110 --> 03:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
dirty data it was a complete fiasco
 
03:00:15.590 --> 03:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
the research was submitted to
 
03:00:18.150 --> 03:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
a paper competition
 
03:00:20.790 --> 03:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
and won the outstanding paper of the
 
03:00:22.790 --> 03:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
year award
 
03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:23.670 align:start position:0%
year award
and

03:00:23.670 --> 03:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:00:25.590 --> 03:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
will be published
 
03:00:27.590 --> 03:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
um i'm one of the judges in the contest
 
03:00:29.590 --> 03:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
which is the only reason i know about it
 
03:00:31.110 --> 03:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:00:33.830 --> 03:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
would you believe that this could be
 
03:00:35.429 --> 03:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
that big a waste
 
03:00:38.790 --> 03:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire resources to wind up
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:44.870 --> 03:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
i believe you especially since you were
 
03:00:47.429 --> 03:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
my professor at unh i will not disagree
 
03:00:52.150 --> 03:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
i've i've learned i've learned
 
03:00:58.070 --> 03:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
at which place you learn to trust him as
 
03:01:00.790 --> 03:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
you are you saying
 
03:01:03.030 --> 03:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
we go way back
 
03:01:08.389 --> 03:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:10.389 --> 03:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:01:12.710 --> 03:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
taking the question uh i i just want to
 
03:01:14.710 --> 03:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
understand from your testimony does
 
03:01:17.510 --> 03:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
would you be opposed to the notification
 
03:01:20.070 --> 03:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
of people's ability to opt out so that
 
03:01:22.309 --> 03:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
they could make sure that they are
 
03:01:23.429 --> 03:01:23.439 align:start position:0%
comfortable with having their
 
03:01:26.230 --> 03:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
information in the database or not
 
03:01:28.950 --> 03:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
um i think we'd have to see what the
 
03:01:30.790 --> 03:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
amendment looks like and again the
 
03:01:33.429 --> 03:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal note i
 
03:01:36.230 --> 03:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
i am concerned about again spending um
 
03:01:38.230 --> 03:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
expending i should say um state
 
03:01:42.389 --> 03:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
resources um on on this effort um but um
 
03:01:45.110 --> 03:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
i believe um because of the work i do
 
03:01:48.309 --> 03:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
that the opt out provision is very clear
 
03:01:51.110 --> 03:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
and the author of helping us to create
 
03:01:52.950 --> 03:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
the opt out is sitting in the audience
 
03:01:56.070 --> 03:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
so i i do believe that we have made it
 
03:01:57.590 --> 03:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
very clear there have been some
 
03:01:59.830 --> 03:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
impediments to trying to get the vaccine
 
03:02:02.150 --> 03:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
registry up and running and getting the
 
03:02:05.110 --> 03:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
opt out to be effective um unfortunately
 
03:02:07.830 --> 03:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
but and that has um has been i believe
 
03:02:10.389 --> 03:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
has been a detriment to our our citizens
 
03:02:12.389 --> 03:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
um but um i'd have to see what the
 
03:02:13.750 --> 03:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
amendment looks like before i could
 
03:02:13.760 --> 03:02:14.950 align:start position:0%
amendment looks like before i could
comment

03:02:14.950 --> 03:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
comment
 
03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative folsom
 
03:02:20.309 --> 03:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman pearson thank you for
 
03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's a very simple
 
03:02:24.309 --> 03:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
one when people filled out their
 
03:02:27.030 --> 03:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
information did they by any chance also
 
03:02:30.710 --> 03:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
provide email addresses
 
03:02:33.590 --> 03:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
i do not know um and i was one of them
 
03:02:36.469 --> 03:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
because i got a vaccine at the state
 
03:02:39.110 --> 03:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
site so i don't remember if i gave i was
 
03:02:40.710 --> 03:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
trying to remember this morning as i was
 
03:02:43.269 --> 03:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
driving in i may have i may have i
 
03:02:44.950 --> 03:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
probably did
 
03:02:47.110 --> 03:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative weber says i probably did
 
03:02:49.030 --> 03:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
so um i
 
03:02:50.469 --> 03:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
that's my answer
 
03:02:51.990 --> 03:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
it probably
 
03:02:53.910 --> 03:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
so that would be
 
03:02:57.190 --> 03:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
one way of reducing the costs if you
 
03:03:00.710 --> 03:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
followed up by way of emails
 
03:03:02.070 --> 03:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's another
 
03:03:04.870 --> 03:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
consideration certainly again um i think
 
03:03:06.630 --> 03:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
that's those are all good suggestions
 
03:03:09.670 --> 03:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
for the committee to consider
 
03:03:11.910 --> 03:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you and the
 
03:03:15.349 --> 03:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
last pink card the honorable neil kirk
 
03:03:17.510 --> 03:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
of where and sir it's an honor to sit in
 
03:03:19.670 --> 03:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
the chair that you occupied for quite
 
03:03:22.230 --> 03:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
some time
 
03:03:23.750 --> 03:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman that was another
 
03:03:23.760 --> 03:03:26.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman that was another
committee

03:03:26.790 --> 03:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:29.429 --> 03:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
no no you were finance right that's
 
03:03:31.190 --> 03:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
right this is health and human services
 
03:03:33.429 --> 03:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
as i understand but i'm sitting in the
 
03:03:33.439 --> 03:03:34.790 align:start position:0%
as i understand but i'm sitting in the
chair

03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:03:36.790 --> 03:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
sitting in your chair
 
03:03:39.590 --> 03:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:41.670 --> 03:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for recognizing me mr chairman
 
03:03:43.429 --> 03:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
and for the record i'm neil kirk i live
 
03:03:48.710 --> 03:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:48.720 --> 03:03:51.510 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:03:51.510 --> 03:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:54.309 --> 03:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
i'm very concerned about the opt out ms
 
03:03:56.230 --> 03:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
minihan was very generous in saying that
 
03:03:58.150 --> 03:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
i authored it but
 
03:04:00.070 --> 03:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
there were a great many people involved
 
03:04:03.269 --> 03:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
in that and i was one of them but
 
03:04:06.389 --> 03:04:06.399 align:start position:0%
that's about as much credit as i'll take
 
03:04:06.399 --> 03:04:07.990 align:start position:0%
that's about as much credit as i'll take
uh

03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:04:10.150 --> 03:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with this bill it's
 
03:04:11.670 --> 03:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
very expensive and you don't get much
 
03:04:13.750 --> 03:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
for your money
 
03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:15.190 align:start position:0%
for your money
um

03:04:15.190 --> 03:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:17.349 --> 03:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
i did not give my email address i did
 
03:04:19.429 --> 03:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
not give my telephone number
 
03:04:21.269 --> 03:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
as you might expect i'm concerned about
 
03:04:23.269 --> 03:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
privacy so i give as little information
 
03:04:25.190 --> 03:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
as possible and i'm sure there were many
 
03:04:26.870 --> 03:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
others like me so
 
03:04:28.710 --> 03:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
as you suggested
 
03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative hulsel
 
03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
that probably would not cover a great
 
03:04:33.750 --> 03:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
many people
 
03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:35.030 align:start position:0%
many people
moreover

03:04:35.030 --> 03:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
moreover
 
03:04:36.870 --> 03:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
i think we all know the principle of
 
03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:37.990 align:start position:0%
i think we all know the principle of
inertia

03:04:37.990 --> 03:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
inertia
 
03:04:39.910 --> 03:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
and one of the facts of life is that
 
03:04:41.269 --> 03:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
people don't
 
03:04:43.510 --> 03:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
move unless they're forced to
 
03:04:45.670 --> 03:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
so if you send out notices you're very
 
03:04:47.510 --> 03:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
likely to get a very limited response
 
03:04:49.030 --> 03:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
even if you sent them to every single
 
03:04:50.469 --> 03:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
person in the state and they were
 
03:04:52.309 --> 03:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
actually received
 
03:04:53.910 --> 03:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's just not the way we work as human
 
03:04:53.920 --> 03:04:55.269 align:start position:0%
it's just not the way we work as human
beings

03:04:55.269 --> 03:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
beings
 
03:04:56.870 --> 03:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
to spend somewhere according to the
 
03:04:58.630 --> 03:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note between a million three and
 
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
seven million to
 
03:05:03.349 --> 03:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
do this seems to me to be a waste of
 
03:05:05.110 --> 03:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money whether it's federal
 
03:05:07.510 --> 03:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
money or state money i pay out of both
 
03:05:07.520 --> 03:05:12.469 align:start position:0%
money or state money i pay out of both
pockets

03:05:12.469 --> 03:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
i have another suggestion i have an
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
amendment mr chairman if i may pass it
 
03:05:19.190 --> 03:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
out you may
 
03:05:20.710 --> 03:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
and we are going to be putting an
 
03:05:23.110 --> 03:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
amendment committee together
 
03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
on this under the chairmanship of
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
03:05:29.269 --> 03:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
and others from this committee who may
 
03:05:29.279 --> 03:05:30.790 align:start position:0%
and others from this committee who may
eventually

03:05:30.790 --> 03:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
03:05:39.110 --> 03:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:41.110 --> 03:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment basically
 
03:05:42.950 --> 03:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
is designed to
 
03:05:44.790 --> 03:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
provide a compromise between the
 
03:05:46.630 --> 03:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
information that the department needs to
 
03:05:48.790 --> 03:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
do decent public health work
 
03:05:51.510 --> 03:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
and the privacy interests of citizens
 
03:05:54.630 --> 03:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
that the department will erase
 
03:05:59.429 --> 03:05:59.439 align:start position:0%
all of the personally identifiable
 
03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
information that means name and address
 
03:06:03.990 --> 03:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
not city
 
03:06:06.389 --> 03:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
not the type of vaccine you got not the
 
03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
date that you got it none of those
 
03:06:08.160 --> 03:06:09.830 align:start position:0%
date that you got it none of those
things

03:06:09.830 --> 03:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:06:11.990 --> 03:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
without consulting anyone they will do
 
03:06:14.790 --> 03:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
it as a matter of statutory obligation
 
03:06:18.550 --> 03:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
if this amendment were to be adopted
 
03:06:20.230 --> 03:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
that would put all of us back to the
 
03:06:22.389 --> 03:06:22.399 align:start position:0%
situation that we were in prior to the
 
03:06:25.030 --> 03:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
emergency order 76
 
03:06:27.510 --> 03:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
that would mean that no one would have
 
03:06:30.710 --> 03:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
to opt out everyone would be opted out
 
03:06:33.910 --> 03:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
so we would be back to where we were now
 
03:06:35.990 --> 03:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
like all proposals including those which
 
03:06:37.670 --> 03:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
this committee ultimately adopts there
 
03:06:40.790 --> 03:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
are going to be trade-offs
 
03:06:42.870 --> 03:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
if this amendment were to be adopted it
 
03:06:45.269 --> 03:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
would make it impossible for anyone to
 
03:06:47.269 --> 03:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
call the vaccine registry and say help
 
03:06:49.269 --> 03:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
i've lost my information
 
03:06:51.349 --> 03:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
please give me what you have it wouldn't
 
03:06:52.950 --> 03:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
be there
 
03:06:55.830 --> 03:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
and that could be problematic for people
 
03:06:58.070 --> 03:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
but that's one of the prices that we pay
 
03:07:00.710 --> 03:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
in this case in this approach
 
03:07:02.309 --> 03:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
to give the department the information
 
03:07:04.469 --> 03:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
they need to do public health research
 
03:07:06.790 --> 03:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
and yet balance that with privacy
 
03:07:09.510 --> 03:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
interests so they don't know
 
03:07:11.510 --> 03:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
the names and addresses of the people
 
03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
who got vaccinations
 
03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
there are many other ways that you could
 
03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
go with this and i'm sure mr chairman
 
03:07:19.990 --> 03:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
with your
 
03:07:21.510 --> 03:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
amendment committee you will come up
 
03:07:23.830 --> 03:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
with something but it will be a balance
 
03:07:25.429 --> 03:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
you will have to give up some things
 
03:07:27.190 --> 03:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
including privacy in order to get some
 
03:07:28.790 --> 03:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
other things
 
03:07:30.870 --> 03:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
but i would ask you not to impose upon
 
03:07:33.030 --> 03:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
the department an obligation which
 
03:07:34.950 --> 03:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
really um
 
03:07:36.870 --> 03:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
is not going to be productive and that
 
03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
is to notify people it doesn't work
 
03:07:42.630 --> 03:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
decide one way or another which way you
 
03:07:44.710 --> 03:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
want to go and do what you can to solve
 
03:07:44.720 --> 03:07:46.790 align:start position:0%
want to go and do what you can to solve
it

03:07:46.790 --> 03:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
one other thing that you might consider
 
03:07:49.750 --> 03:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
is this
 
03:07:52.469 --> 03:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
it's not the best thing
 
03:07:54.309 --> 03:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
but it would be for the department to
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
mount a pr campaign and i don't mean
 
03:07:58.389 --> 03:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
something where you send a letter to an
 
03:07:58.399 --> 03:07:59.830 align:start position:0%
something where you send a letter to an
individual

03:07:59.830 --> 03:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
i mean a massive pr campaign
 
03:08:08.870 --> 03:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:11.349 --> 03:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
website their website of course that
 
03:08:12.710 --> 03:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
tells people
 
03:08:15.269 --> 03:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
that they have 30 days or 60 days to opt
 
03:08:15.279 --> 03:08:16.790 align:start position:0%
that they have 30 days or 60 days to opt
out

03:08:16.790 --> 03:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:08:18.550 --> 03:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
and if they want to do that all they
 
03:08:19.830 --> 03:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
have to do is send the department a
 
03:08:21.269 --> 03:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
letter you don't have to have a doctor
 
03:08:23.190 --> 03:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
signature you don't have to do anything
 
03:08:25.110 --> 03:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
fancy like in some cases the department
 
03:08:27.429 --> 03:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
through its forms require you to do to
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
opt out making it almost impossible as a
 
03:08:31.670 --> 03:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
practical matter to opt out or at least
 
03:08:31.680 --> 03:08:33.269 align:start position:0%
practical matter to opt out or at least
so

03:08:33.269 --> 03:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:08:34.790 --> 03:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
burdensome that many people who would
 
03:08:36.389 --> 03:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
like to opt out just will not go through
 
03:08:40.710 --> 03:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:42.550 --> 03:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
that approach requires good faith on the
 
03:08:44.469 --> 03:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
departed department which i think you
 
03:08:45.670 --> 03:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
can count on
 
03:08:48.710 --> 03:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
but it would give everybody real notice
 
03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
that they can opt out
 
03:08:53.030 --> 03:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
and those people who are concerned about
 
03:08:55.269 --> 03:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
it will fill out a little form hi my
 
03:08:57.110 --> 03:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
name is neil kirk date of birth blank
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
blank blank my address is such and such
 
03:09:01.110 --> 03:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
kindly opt me out
 
03:09:03.429 --> 03:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
i don't have to have it notarized
 
03:09:05.510 --> 03:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have to have my doctor sign
 
03:09:07.030 --> 03:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
i don't have to do anything i can take
 
03:09:08.710 --> 03:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
an ordinary piece of paper and i can do
 
03:09:10.630 --> 03:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
it by mail
 
03:09:12.070 --> 03:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
if i don't want to give away my email
 
03:09:13.750 --> 03:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
address so i don't have to do it on
 
03:09:15.349 --> 03:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
their website
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
or i can do it on their website whatever
 
03:09:18.550 --> 03:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
you want but giving everybody an option
 
03:09:20.790 --> 03:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
to do it a clean way that's another way
 
03:09:22.550 --> 03:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
probably a decent compromise but the
 
03:09:26.070 --> 03:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that i put before you is one
 
03:09:28.309 --> 03:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
thing i'd like you to consider
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
good luck mr chairman thank you and i'd
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
be pleased to answer any questions if
 
03:09:34.389 --> 03:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
there are any representative connect ask
 
03:09:34.399 --> 03:09:35.830 align:start position:0%
there are any representative connect ask
representative

03:09:35.830 --> 03:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:09:37.990 --> 03:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
kirk yes exactly i was nice to see my
 
03:09:41.190 --> 03:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
doppelganger um so yes i have a question
 
03:09:43.030 --> 03:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's only that's only a name
 
03:09:44.790 --> 03:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
certainly not in physique
 
03:09:46.870 --> 03:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
hey come on we're the same size uh we
 
03:09:49.510 --> 03:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
had katowski going that one day um so
 
03:09:51.510 --> 03:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
here's my question and what you just
 
03:09:52.950 --> 03:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
said that proposal because it's just
 
03:09:53.990 --> 03:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
because i had written the same thing
 
03:09:56.550 --> 03:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
down just a massive public education
 
03:09:57.990 --> 03:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
thing for opting out
 
03:10:00.550 --> 03:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
my question is would you then
 
03:10:01.830 --> 03:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
if we did that
 
03:10:03.349 --> 03:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
you would not
 
03:10:06.229 --> 03:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
have the automatic deletion yes
 
03:10:08.790 --> 03:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
if you do in a massive pr campaign you
 
03:10:11.510 --> 03:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
don't need the automatic deletion
 
03:10:13.030 --> 03:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
the information would stay in the
 
03:10:14.790 --> 03:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
registry except for those people who in
 
03:10:16.710 --> 03:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
response to the campaign
 
03:10:16.720 --> 03:10:17.590 align:start position:0%
response to the campaign
said

03:10:17.590 --> 03:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:10:21.110 --> 03:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:22.469 --> 03:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
that answered my question thank you very
 
03:10:22.479 --> 03:10:23.830 align:start position:0%
that answered my question thank you very
much

03:10:23.830 --> 03:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:10:25.590 --> 03:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
did i see representative webber's hand
 
03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:28.790 align:start position:0%
did i see representative webber's hand
up

03:10:28.790 --> 03:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:30.870 --> 03:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
you did thank you mr chairman
 
03:10:30.880 --> 03:10:33.030 align:start position:0%
you did thank you mr chairman
uh

03:10:33.030 --> 03:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:10:36.790 --> 03:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
can you imagine the harm to all of the

people who assume that their records are
 
03:10:42.870 --> 03:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
being kept and who are glad that their
 
03:10:42.880 --> 03:10:43.670 align:start position:0%
being kept and who are glad that their
rep

rep
 
03:10:45.910 --> 03:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
records are being kept because they're
 
03:10:47.349 --> 03:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
not very good rep

who assume that a registry will keep
 
03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
their records and find when their dog
 
03:10:58.710 --> 03:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
eats their vaccination cards that there
 
03:11:01.750 --> 03:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
is no longer any way of documenting
 
03:11:01.760 --> 03:11:03.190 align:start position:0%
is no longer any way of documenting

representative leon
 
03:11:24.710 --> 03:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:11:26.870 --> 03:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative uh i have a question
 
03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
about the pr campaign is this something
 
03:11:32.389 --> 03:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
where we could have both a tv ad social
 
03:11:35.190 --> 03:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
media on the website and then possibly
 
03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
do an every door direct mailing i'm
 
03:11:39.030 --> 03:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
seeing we could do it as low as 27 cents
 
03:11:41.910 --> 03:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
a postcard just to also hit everybody at
 
03:11:44.309 --> 03:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
their house would that seem to be a more
 
03:11:46.309 --> 03:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable way to reach out instead of
 
03:11:48.389 --> 03:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
individually contacting those who are on
 
03:11:51.110 --> 03:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
the registry already i like everything
 
03:11:53.830 --> 03:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
you said except for the postcard
 
03:11:53.840 --> 03:11:54.630 align:start position:0%
you said except for the postcard
and

03:11:54.630 --> 03:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
the reason is
 
03:11:57.590 --> 03:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
too many people ignore it and it's too
 
03:11:59.910 --> 03:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
expensive it's the the cost-benefit
 
03:12:02.309 --> 03:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
ratio i think is just not worth doing
 
03:12:04.469 --> 03:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
that but everything else probably is
 
03:12:04.479 --> 03:12:06.150 align:start position:0%
that but everything else probably is
worthwhile

03:12:06.150 --> 03:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
worthwhile
 
03:12:10.389 --> 03:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:12.070 --> 03:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:12:13.830 --> 03:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and good luck to
 
03:12:14.950 --> 03:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
all of you
 
03:12:17.030 --> 03:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
would you be interested in helping our
 
03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
amendment committee i'd be glad to serve
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
if asked
 
03:12:23.269 --> 03:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
you've been asked and you've been served
 
03:12:25.670 --> 03:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
let me know when it meets thank you sir
 
03:12:26.630 --> 03:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:12:29.110 --> 03:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
and who else from this committee would
 
03:12:32.790 --> 03:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
like to serve on the committee to come
 
03:12:35.070 --> 03:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
up with an amendment
 
03:12:39.269 --> 03:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:41.670 --> 03:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
and gay
 
03:12:41.680 --> 03:12:47.190 align:start position:0%
and gay
okay

03:12:47.190 --> 03:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
all right that's a good start if you uh
 
03:12:49.680 --> 03:12:51.030 align:start position:0%
all right that's a good start if you uh
suddenly

03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
suddenly
 
03:12:54.070 --> 03:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
decide to you can let
 
03:12:59.429 --> 03:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
and with that i closed the hearing on
 
03:13:01.680 --> 03:13:03.670 align:start position:0%
and with that i closed the hearing on
1608

03:13:03.670 --> 03:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
1608
 
03:13:05.670 --> 03:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
fn and
 
03:13:07.269 --> 03:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
we had planned
 
03:13:09.670 --> 03:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock for representative woods
 
03:13:11.670 --> 03:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
to make a presentation on the question
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
of what is science
 
03:13:15.590 --> 03:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
and it's not obligatory although i'm
 
03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to miss it
 
03:13:19.990 --> 03:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard the term science invoked all
 
03:13:21.269 --> 03:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
over the place
 
03:13:23.510 --> 03:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
often incorrectly
 
03:13:25.190 --> 03:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
and he and i
 
03:13:27.110 --> 03:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
three four weeks ago had a conversation
 
03:13:31.030 --> 03:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
on well what exactly is science and i
 
03:13:33.670 --> 03:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
thought his answer was masterful so i
 
03:13:35.670 --> 03:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
said would you make a presentation to
 
03:13:38.710 --> 03:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
the committee for our edification so
 
03:13:40.550 --> 03:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's at one o'clock if you wish to be
 
03:13:43.190 --> 03:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
here you certainly may the next hearing
 
03:13:46.469 --> 03:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
will start as advertised at 1 20. we're
 
03:14:06.790 --> 03:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:06.800 --> 03:14:35.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:14:35.429 --> 03:14:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:35.439 --> 03:14:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
great

03:14:39.830 --> 03:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:39.840 --> 03:14:40.630 align:start position:0%
 
good

03:14:40.630 --> 03:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:18:05.349 --> 03:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:05.359 --> 03:29:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:29:49.670 --> 03:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:58.870 --> 03:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:00.950 --> 03:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
no you asked the question in the reverse
 
03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
order it is while i'm eating me i listen
 
03:33:06.630 --> 03:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:06.640 --> 03:33:07.670 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:33:07.670 --> 03:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:33:10.309 --> 03:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:12.950 --> 03:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
this topic came up and i must confess i
 
03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
don't recall the exact discussion
 
03:33:18.150 --> 03:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
that the chair and i had relative to
 
03:33:21.590 --> 03:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
what is science so i hope i'm hoping i
 
03:33:23.910 --> 03:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
am covering what he had in mind
 
03:33:23.920 --> 03:33:25.670 align:start position:0%
am covering what he had in mind
um

03:33:25.670 --> 03:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:27.030 --> 03:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
03:33:29.750 --> 03:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
this is a sort of a general perspective
 
03:33:30.870 --> 03:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
of mine
 
03:33:30.880 --> 03:33:33.510 align:start position:0%
of mine
um

03:33:33.510 --> 03:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:35.510 --> 03:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
sort of uh uh
 
03:33:38.150 --> 03:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
jeff's not here but uh i he's he always
 
03:33:38.160 --> 03:33:38.790 align:start position:0%
jeff's not here but uh i he's he always
uh

03:33:38.790 --> 03:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:33:40.389 --> 03:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
gives me a hard time about talking from
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
the 30 000 foot level and this is
 
03:33:44.630 --> 03:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
probably a hundred thousand foot level
 
03:33:47.510 --> 03:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh but uh hopefully it'll stimulate uh
 
03:33:49.269 --> 03:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
some thinking and just give a
 
03:33:50.630 --> 03:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
perspective on
 
03:33:52.469 --> 03:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
of um
 
03:33:55.190 --> 03:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
my take on science uh just a very quick
 
03:33:58.469 --> 03:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
background um i went to berkeley you
 
03:34:01.190 --> 03:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
know a little school on the west coast
 
03:34:03.510 --> 03:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
from being from california
 
03:34:05.429 --> 03:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
in physics and then did my graduate work
 
03:34:07.990 --> 03:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
in biophysics at hopkins
 
03:34:10.309 --> 03:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
before i went to medical school and
 
03:34:12.469 --> 03:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
had maintained over the years
 
03:34:15.269 --> 03:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
a close uh relationship with things like
 
03:34:15.279 --> 03:34:16.790 align:start position:0%
a close uh relationship with things like
nanotechnology

03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
nanotechnology
 
03:34:18.790 --> 03:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh and served on ama's council on
 
03:34:20.950 --> 03:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
science and public health uh
 
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
and a variety of other things and uh my
 
03:34:26.710 --> 03:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh i i've enjoyed a lot of it and it's
 
03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh interesting to see the progress of
 
03:34:28.560 --> 03:34:29.910 align:start position:0%
uh interesting to see the progress of
science

03:34:29.910 --> 03:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
science
 
03:34:34.150 --> 03:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
well what is and isn't science um
 
03:34:36.389 --> 03:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh in a sense i i can do this in a
 
03:34:36.399 --> 03:34:38.550 align:start position:0%
uh in a sense i i can do this in a
sentence

03:34:38.550 --> 03:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
03:34:40.389 --> 03:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
science is
 
03:34:44.229 --> 03:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
a social cultural construct used to
 
03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
engage our environment
 
03:34:48.469 --> 03:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
science isn't
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
an ethical or moral guide
 
03:34:52.710 --> 03:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
there that's what science is what
 
03:34:54.150 --> 03:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
science isn't thank you very much we
 
03:34:57.190 --> 03:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
please go on
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to expand on this a little
 
03:35:01.670 --> 03:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
bit and
 
03:35:03.349 --> 03:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
try to put a little bit of perspective
 
03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
on what i think of science
 
03:35:05.920 --> 03:35:07.269 align:start position:0%
on what i think of science
um

03:35:07.269 --> 03:35:07.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:09.670 --> 03:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
introduce it with a quote from eo wilson
 
03:35:10.790 --> 03:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
who's a
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
well-known scientist and
 
03:35:14.630 --> 03:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
his quote he
 
03:35:16.550 --> 03:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
made the observation
 
03:35:21.349 --> 03:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
that humans have paleolithic emotions
 
03:35:21.359 --> 03:35:22.830 align:start position:0%
that humans have paleolithic emotions
medieval

03:35:22.830 --> 03:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
medieval
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:29.830 --> 03:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
that sort of puts us in perspective of
 
03:35:31.990 --> 03:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
where we are as individuals in this new
 
03:35:34.229 --> 03:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
you of science and i'll try and expand
 
03:35:35.190 --> 03:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
on that
 
03:35:36.830 --> 03:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
and close with a couple
 
03:35:39.910 --> 03:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions so what is science as i said i
 
03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
i view science as a social cultural
 
03:35:47.510 --> 03:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:49.670 --> 03:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
but what are its characteristics
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
well science is really as old as
 
03:35:51.359 --> 03:35:52.710 align:start position:0%
well science is really as old as
humanity

03:35:52.710 --> 03:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
humanity
 
03:35:54.710 --> 03:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's probably an expression of a
 
03:35:57.990 --> 03:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
fight flight self-preservation mode
 
03:35:59.910 --> 03:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
tracking animals to see whether that was
 
03:36:01.910 --> 03:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
the bobcat that was going to eat them or
 
03:36:04.710 --> 03:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
whether that was just a bird around
 
03:36:06.870 --> 03:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
that was collecting data
 
03:36:08.950 --> 03:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
and it served him well so he could
 
03:36:11.590 --> 03:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
figure out what was around and what he
 
03:36:13.190 --> 03:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
didn't want to know about
 
03:36:13.200 --> 03:36:14.070 align:start position:0%
didn't want to know about
um

03:36:14.070 --> 03:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:17.670 --> 03:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
there are some species of nut ammons
 
03:36:19.510 --> 03:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's why it's supposed to be people
 
03:36:21.670 --> 03:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
call it almonds but
 
03:36:23.429 --> 03:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
the correct pronunciation is actually
 
03:36:23.439 --> 03:36:25.910 align:start position:0%
the correct pronunciation is actually
ammons

03:36:25.910 --> 03:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
ammons
 
03:36:27.110 --> 03:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
and some were
 
03:36:29.670 --> 03:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
poisonous and over the course of time
 
03:36:31.590 --> 03:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
they found that some weren't
 
03:36:35.349 --> 03:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
so with observation and a deduction
 
03:36:37.349 --> 03:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
sort of a scientific method
 
03:36:40.870 --> 03:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
they were able to eat almonds
 
03:36:43.269 --> 03:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
taming animals growing crops planting by
 
03:36:44.710 --> 03:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
the seasons
 
03:36:47.190 --> 03:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
that's a synthetic process
 
03:36:49.510 --> 03:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
putting some of the data together
 
03:36:50.950 --> 03:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
taming animals
 
03:36:52.870 --> 03:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
goats cows
 
03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
for good
 
03:36:56.950 --> 03:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
meat and for milk
 
03:36:59.590 --> 03:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
instead of walking five miles to pick up
 
03:37:02.550 --> 03:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
the wild rice uh he dropped some on the
 
03:37:04.229 --> 03:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
way and next spring he found out gee
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
it's sprouted hmm
 
03:37:08.309 --> 03:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
why should i walk five miles when i just
 
03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
put it in my backyard and voila we have
 
03:37:12.870 --> 03:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
a agriculture
 
03:37:14.870 --> 03:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
planting by the seasons
 
03:37:17.190 --> 03:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
and the mayans and the british we've
 
03:37:19.590 --> 03:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
seen all kinds of large structures to
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
keep track of the seasons
 
03:37:22.950 --> 03:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
to do just that
 
03:37:26.389 --> 03:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
so science is really not new
 
03:37:30.229 --> 03:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
sciences however has become very complex
 
03:37:32.389 --> 03:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
shifting from a reductionistic to a
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
synthetic approach
 
03:37:35.590 --> 03:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
reductionistic is
 
03:37:38.229 --> 03:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
what's that small piece made of
 
03:37:39.670 --> 03:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit of
 
03:37:42.309 --> 03:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
rock turns into sand sand turns into
 
03:37:44.630 --> 03:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
atoms and adamson turned into subatomic
 
03:37:44.640 --> 03:37:46.309 align:start position:0%
atoms and adamson turned into subatomic
particles

03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
particles
 
03:37:46.319 --> 03:37:48.229 align:start position:0%
particles
um

03:37:48.229 --> 03:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
our bodies uh
 
03:37:55.269 --> 03:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh vesalius um did some anatomy
 
03:37:57.030 --> 03:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
took things apart and we've gotten
 
03:37:58.710 --> 03:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
smaller we found organs and then we
 
03:38:00.389 --> 03:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
found different kinds of cells we got a
 
03:38:00.399 --> 03:38:01.590 align:start position:0%
found different kinds of cells we got a
microscope

03:38:01.590 --> 03:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
microscope
 
03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
and then we found there's kind of
 
03:38:04.790 --> 03:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
molecules inside what kind of molecules
 
03:38:06.070 --> 03:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
were there well we get smaller and
 
03:38:07.269 --> 03:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
smaller and
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
and then we come together with physics
 
03:38:11.030 --> 03:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
and biology where the
 
03:38:13.349 --> 03:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
subatomic and some of the atomic things
 
03:38:13.359 --> 03:38:16.070 align:start position:0%
subatomic and some of the atomic things
overlap

03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
but science although it's complex is
 
03:38:19.750 --> 03:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
also unsettled
 
03:38:22.229 --> 03:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
we don't know a lot of answers
 
03:38:22.239 --> 03:38:23.429 align:start position:0%
we don't know a lot of answers
and

03:38:23.429 --> 03:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:26.469 --> 03:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
those two things go together complexity
 
03:38:30.150 --> 03:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
and unsettled go hand in hand
 
03:38:33.750 --> 03:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:36.389 --> 03:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
science is really a balance of some sort
 
03:38:39.750 --> 03:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
between inspiration the aha look what i
 
03:38:39.760 --> 03:38:40.710 align:start position:0%
between inspiration the aha look what i
found

03:38:40.710 --> 03:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
found
 
03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
and investigation
 
03:38:45.269 --> 03:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
they typical
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
do the experiment and make the
 
03:38:49.750 --> 03:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
hypothesis kind of approach
 
03:38:51.750 --> 03:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
but it's also made up of a lot of
 
03:38:51.760 --> 03:38:53.510 align:start position:0%
but it's also made up of a lot of
mistakes

03:38:53.510 --> 03:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
03:38:55.750 --> 03:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
and some triumphs
 
03:38:58.950 --> 03:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
and those also have to be balanced
 
03:38:58.960 --> 03:39:00.550 align:start position:0%
and those also have to be balanced
finally

03:39:00.550 --> 03:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
finally
 
03:39:03.910 --> 03:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
characteristic science is progressive
 
03:39:05.830 --> 03:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
always looking to see how new
 
03:39:08.870 --> 03:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
information can be applied
 
03:39:12.469 --> 03:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:15.510 --> 03:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
what science isn't
 
03:39:17.990 --> 03:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
science as i said is not an ethical or
 
03:39:20.309 --> 03:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
moral guide
 
03:39:23.349 --> 03:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
science tells us what we know
 
03:39:25.349 --> 03:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
but not how to use
 
03:39:27.429 --> 03:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
what we know
 
03:39:31.590 --> 03:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:33.349 --> 03:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
probably one of the classic examples of
 
03:39:35.670 --> 03:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
the problem of finding out what basic
 
03:39:38.790 --> 03:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
science does and has its application
 
03:39:41.670 --> 03:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
is nuclear fission
 
03:39:44.229 --> 03:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
wow look at the energy we can get out
 
03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
by having
 
03:39:48.150 --> 03:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
controlling nuclear fission
 
03:39:50.309 --> 03:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
and then someone discovered wow we can
 
03:39:55.830 --> 03:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:57.429 --> 03:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
science doesn't tell us anything about
 
03:40:01.110 --> 03:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:03.030 align:start position:0%
 
5g

03:40:03.030 --> 03:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
5g
 
03:40:05.030 --> 03:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
this legislature had a commission on 5g
 
03:40:07.349 --> 03:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
and its biologic impacts
 
03:40:11.990 --> 03:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
5g has a tremendous amount of potential
 
03:40:12.000 --> 03:40:13.110 align:start position:0%
5g has a tremendous amount of potential
but

03:40:13.110 --> 03:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
from the basic science served i served
 
03:40:16.309 --> 03:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
on the commission
 
03:40:19.189 --> 03:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
the basic science behind some radiation
 
03:40:22.150 --> 03:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
is very disturbing and i would love to
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
talk to you about proton tunneling and
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
the disruption of the
 
03:40:28.630 --> 03:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
bonds in dna but that's for another
 
03:40:28.640 --> 03:40:30.630 align:start position:0%
bonds in dna but that's for another
story

03:40:30.630 --> 03:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
story
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
pfas this commit this uh legislature's
 
03:40:36.790 --> 03:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
also dealing with pfets
 
03:40:38.469 --> 03:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
well at berkeley i worked for a company
 
03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
that had the patent for teflon didn't
 
03:40:42.309 --> 03:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
know exactly what to do with it and gave
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
it to dupont
 
03:40:47.910 --> 03:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
needless to say they wish they hadn't
 
03:40:47.920 --> 03:40:48.710 align:start position:0%
needless to say they wish they hadn't
but

03:40:48.710 --> 03:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:40:52.309 --> 03:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
out of teflon came all the pfas kinds of
 
03:40:52.319 --> 03:40:54.070 align:start position:0%
out of teflon came all the pfas kinds of
chemicals

03:40:54.070 --> 03:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
chemicals
 
03:40:57.349 --> 03:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
so science tells us we can get stuff but
 
03:40:59.750 --> 03:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
not how to use it properly
 
03:41:03.510 --> 03:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:03.520 --> 03:41:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
observations

03:41:09.590 --> 03:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:11.750 --> 03:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
technology is just
 
03:41:15.910 --> 03:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
progressing at such a tremendous pace
 
03:41:17.670 --> 03:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
it's outstripping
 
03:41:19.830 --> 03:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
the what i mentioned to begin with the
 
03:41:23.990 --> 03:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
social social and cultural constructs
 
03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
technology is just going
 
03:41:33.110 --> 03:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:35.670 --> 03:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
with the pace that we that uh that is
 
03:41:37.269 --> 03:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
unbelievable and we can see that with
 
03:41:39.110 --> 03:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
computer example as computers and how
 
03:41:39.120 --> 03:41:39.990 align:start position:0%
computer example as computers and how
fast

03:41:39.990 --> 03:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
fast
 
03:41:42.870 --> 03:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
they've progressed
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
but how we use computers
 
03:41:51.750 --> 03:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:54.150 --> 03:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
what science isn't
 
03:41:57.030 --> 03:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's not settled but it can still be
 
03:41:58.309 --> 03:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
quite useful
 
03:42:00.790 --> 03:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
and we need to be aware of that
 
03:42:05.750 --> 03:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:05.760 --> 03:42:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:42:07.590 --> 03:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:42:10.550 --> 03:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
gravity is settled
 
03:42:14.309 --> 03:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
no it's not i agree it's not settled
 
03:42:17.030 --> 03:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
if you drill down to quantum mechanics
 
03:42:19.030 --> 03:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
and that's the physics of small
 
03:42:19.040 --> 03:42:21.990 align:start position:0%
and that's the physics of small
particles

03:42:21.990 --> 03:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:24.229 --> 03:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
they can't take into account gravity and
 
03:42:24.239 --> 03:42:25.510 align:start position:0%
they can't take into account gravity and
there's

03:42:25.510 --> 03:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:42:27.750 --> 03:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
totally said that quantum mechanics and
 
03:42:29.429 --> 03:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
quantum electrodynamics is one of the
 
03:42:31.349 --> 03:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
most precise
 
03:42:31.359 --> 03:42:32.309 align:start position:0%
most precise
theories

03:42:32.309 --> 03:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
theories
 
03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
and experimental supported theories ever
 
03:42:37.429 --> 03:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
invented by manned
 
03:42:40.150 --> 03:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
but it can't take into account gravity
 
03:42:43.110 --> 03:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:45.910 --> 03:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
but we have no trouble we know that if
 
03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
we step off of the table we're gonna
 
03:42:50.550 --> 03:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
fall down
 
03:42:52.070 --> 03:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
yet on the other end at the end of the
 
03:42:54.469 --> 03:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
universe as we know it
 
03:42:55.990 --> 03:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
there are some things that are we're
 
03:42:57.410 --> 03:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
seeing that are saying hmm
 
03:42:57.420 --> 03:42:58.630 align:start position:0%
seeing that are saying hmm
[Music]

03:42:58.630 --> 03:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:42:58.640 --> 03:42:59.429 align:start position:0%
[Music]
well

03:42:59.429 --> 03:42:59.439 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
maybe we should make some adjustments in
 
03:43:03.670 --> 03:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
gravity too
 
03:43:05.510 --> 03:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
so at the small
 
03:43:07.349 --> 03:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
and at the very large
 
03:43:15.189 --> 03:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:18.560 --> 03:43:19.189 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:43:19.189 --> 03:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:43:20.950 --> 03:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
like to ask when i do these kinds of
 
03:43:20.960 --> 03:43:23.030 align:start position:0%
like to ask when i do these kinds of
talks

03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
talks
 
03:43:23.040 --> 03:43:23.830 align:start position:0%
talks
where

03:43:23.830 --> 03:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:30.960 --> 03:43:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

03:43:35.510 --> 03:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:39.429 --> 03:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:41.830 --> 03:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
your eye works
 
03:43:43.990 --> 03:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
because a photon quantum particle comes
 
03:43:45.670 --> 03:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
in interacts
 
03:43:47.910 --> 03:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
with a molecule creates a quantum
 
03:43:50.150 --> 03:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
mechanical process
 
03:43:51.830 --> 03:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
and that sends an impulse and those
 
03:43:54.150 --> 03:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
collection of photons interacting and
 
03:43:56.229 --> 03:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
those collections of impulse
 
03:43:57.189 --> 03:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
we call
 
03:43:57.199 --> 03:43:59.030 align:start position:0%
we call
vision

03:43:59.030 --> 03:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
vision
 
03:44:02.229 --> 03:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
so you love quantum mechanics
 
03:44:07.830 --> 03:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:07.840 --> 03:44:10.870 align:start position:0%

03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:10.880 --> 03:44:12.710 align:start position:0%
 
ah

03:44:12.710 --> 03:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
ah
 
03:44:14.630 --> 03:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
why of course you don't use relativity
 
03:44:16.630 --> 03:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
how many feel they have a familiarity
 
03:44:16.640 --> 03:44:17.590 align:start position:0%
how many feel they have a familiarity
with

03:44:17.590 --> 03:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
relativity special and general
 
03:44:19.760 --> 03:44:21.510 align:start position:0%
relativity special and general

03:44:21.510 --> 03:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
relativity
 
03:44:23.830 --> 03:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
when the sun's hitting us
 
03:44:27.349 --> 03:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
excuse me when the sun is hitting us
 
03:44:27.359 --> 03:44:29.349 align:start position:0%
excuse me when the sun is hitting us
um

03:44:29.349 --> 03:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:29.359 --> 03:44:31.030 align:start position:0%

03:44:37.750 --> 03:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
and you use gps correct you get places
 
03:44:40.389 --> 03:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
gps does not work
 
03:44:42.710 --> 03:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
if you don't use special and general
 
03:44:42.720 --> 03:44:45.189 align:start position:0%
if you don't use special and general
relativity

03:44:45.189 --> 03:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
relativity
 
03:44:47.349 --> 03:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
if you did not take into account general
 
03:44:47.359 --> 03:44:48.630 align:start position:0%
if you did not take into account general
relativity

03:44:48.630 --> 03:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
relativity
 
03:44:50.630 --> 03:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
within very short order within about a
 
03:44:53.510 --> 03:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
minute or two it would be inaccurate i
 
03:44:55.990 --> 03:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
mean really inaccurate
 
03:44:56.000 --> 03:44:56.830 align:start position:0%
mean really inaccurate
so

03:44:56.830 --> 03:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:56.840 --> 03:44:58.550 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:01.030 --> 03:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
enjoy your quantum mechanics enjoy your
 
03:45:02.950 --> 03:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
special relativity
 
03:45:06.309 --> 03:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
um science is now much more complex
 
03:45:06.319 --> 03:45:07.349 align:start position:0%
um science is now much more complex
and

03:45:07.349 --> 03:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:10.950 --> 03:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's in the sense that it's truly global
 
03:45:13.110 --> 03:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
a pattern that we don't generally think
 
03:45:13.120 --> 03:45:14.389 align:start position:0%
a pattern that we don't generally think
of

03:45:14.389 --> 03:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:45:17.110 --> 03:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's truly intergenerational
 
03:45:20.309 --> 03:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
crispr you know genetic modifications
 
03:45:22.630 --> 03:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
that's truly intergenerational so
 
03:45:24.870 --> 03:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
science is complex
 
03:45:28.150 --> 03:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
truly global and truly intergenerational
 
03:45:29.990 --> 03:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
sort of aspects that we don't deal with
 
03:45:31.510 --> 03:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis
 
03:45:34.150 --> 03:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
the power of science is really becoming
 
03:45:37.510 --> 03:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
to the fore i'll just use one example
 
03:45:39.269 --> 03:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh we're all familiar with the concept
 
03:45:41.429 --> 03:45:41.439 align:start position:0%
of artificial intelligence one of those
 
03:45:44.309 --> 03:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
far out sort of science fiction
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
but we're now finding that using ai we
 
03:45:49.429 --> 03:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
can use retinal scans x-rays and
 
03:45:53.349 --> 03:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
evaluation of pathology slide cells
 
03:45:57.189 --> 03:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:57.199 --> 03:45:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:45:58.070 --> 03:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:00.710 --> 03:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh just to give you an idea how comp or
 
03:46:03.590 --> 03:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
how powerful it is you know about uh
 
03:46:05.349 --> 03:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
checkers so you can write a program to
 
03:46:06.710 --> 03:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
beat somebody at checkers you can write
 
03:46:08.469 --> 03:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
a program for chess meet somebody at
 
03:46:11.110 --> 03:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
checkers very simple that's an eight by
 
03:46:11.120 --> 03:46:11.990 align:start position:0%
checkers very simple that's an eight by
eight

03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
eight
 
03:46:14.309 --> 03:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
board that plays on
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
the game of go which you may be familiar
 
03:46:19.429 --> 03:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
with is 19 by 19
 
03:46:21.750 --> 03:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
much larger
 
03:46:23.590 --> 03:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
03:46:27.189 --> 03:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
possible moves in a single game of go
 
03:46:29.590 --> 03:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
is greater than the number of atoms in
 
03:46:35.189 --> 03:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:38.150 --> 03:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
however using ai they were able to beat
 
03:46:40.790 --> 03:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
the international champion four to one
 
03:46:42.389 --> 03:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
and in one game they thought the
 
03:46:45.030 --> 03:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
computer hit a glitch everybody went
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
including the international championship
 
03:46:49.590 --> 03:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness what was that
 
03:46:50.790 --> 03:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
turns out
 
03:46:53.830 --> 03:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
it never been conceived of by humans
 
03:46:59.110 --> 03:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:01.030 --> 03:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
there's a quote i want you to tell me
 
03:47:02.309 --> 03:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
who wrote it
 
03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
he who controls a.i will control the
 
03:47:04.640 --> 03:47:10.150 align:start position:0%
he who controls a.i will control the
world

03:47:10.150 --> 03:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:15.590 --> 03:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
and i think he is
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:21.910 --> 03:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
what is science it's uh
 
03:47:23.429 --> 03:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
it's different
 
03:47:26.070 --> 03:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
for scientists and lay persons
 
03:47:27.349 --> 03:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
increasingly because of the
 
03:47:30.630 --> 03:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
sophistication and complexity of science
 
03:47:33.189 --> 03:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
this was pointed out by c.p snow in 59
 
03:47:35.189 --> 03:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
when he gave a series of lectures about
 
03:47:35.199 --> 03:47:36.070 align:start position:0%
when he gave a series of lectures about
the

03:47:36.070 --> 03:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:47:39.670 --> 03:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
disparity between science and the arts
 
03:47:39.680 --> 03:47:41.269 align:start position:0%
disparity between science and the arts
um

03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:44.710 --> 03:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:46.389 --> 03:47:46.399 align:start position:0%
some of it the quantum mechanics
 
03:47:49.750 --> 03:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
relativity and ai and sometimes if we've
 
03:47:51.590 --> 03:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
taken the position of the culture
 
03:47:54.070 --> 03:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes if we don't under know it or
 
03:47:55.830 --> 03:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
we don't understand it
 
03:47:59.269 --> 03:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:01.189 --> 03:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
however um
 
03:48:03.030 --> 03:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
we can't do that
 
03:48:03.040 --> 03:48:04.309 align:start position:0%
we can't do that
and

03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:48:06.550 --> 03:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
we're impacted
 
03:48:09.750 --> 03:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
with science from every direction
 
03:48:11.670 --> 03:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
and we can't ignore it
 
03:48:13.750 --> 03:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
and we deal with it
 
03:48:14.950 --> 03:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
so i want to leave you with two
 
03:48:14.960 --> 03:48:17.030 align:start position:0%
so i want to leave you with two
questions

03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:48:20.950 --> 03:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:22.389 --> 03:48:22.399 align:start position:0%
the answer to the second question
 
03:48:24.630 --> 03:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
addresses our common goal
 
03:48:27.510 --> 03:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
producing good legislation
 
03:48:28.950 --> 03:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
the first question
 
03:48:30.630 --> 03:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
moral comment
 
03:48:32.870 --> 03:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
will science be able to answer
 
03:48:32.880 --> 03:48:34.150 align:start position:0%
will science be able to answer
all

03:48:34.150 --> 03:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:48:34.160 --> 03:48:35.830 align:start position:0%
all
questions

03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:48:37.269 --> 03:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
or put it another way
 
03:48:39.750 --> 03:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
does man have the intellectual capacity
 
03:48:41.830 --> 03:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
to understand all processes in the
 
03:48:41.840 --> 03:48:44.630 align:start position:0%
to understand all processes in the
universe

03:48:44.630 --> 03:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:49.110 --> 03:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
the answer is casually assumed to be yes
 
03:48:50.790 --> 03:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
but that remains to be seen and may
 
03:48:56.630 --> 03:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:58.469 --> 03:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
second is the question i want to leave
 
03:48:59.830 --> 03:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
you with
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
how can we better understand and
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
interpret society's response
 
03:49:10.710 --> 03:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:13.590 --> 03:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
often there is confusion in the public
 
03:49:16.550 --> 03:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
about the interpretation of science
 
03:49:19.590 --> 03:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
leading to conflicting postures
 
03:49:20.870 --> 03:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore my reference to
 
03:49:20.880 --> 03:49:22.550 align:start position:0%
and therefore my reference to
legislation

03:49:22.550 --> 03:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines not being fully
 
03:49:27.110 --> 03:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
fda approved
 
03:49:29.830 --> 03:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
not just eu approved
 
03:49:32.309 --> 03:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
fully fda approved led many to reject
 
03:49:32.319 --> 03:49:35.910 align:start position:0%
fully fda approved led many to reject
acceptance

03:49:35.910 --> 03:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:39.189 --> 03:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
on the other hand we've heard ivermectin
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
is not fda approved
 
03:49:44.070 --> 03:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
for treatment yet receives very wide
 
03:49:45.910 --> 03:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
support even though it has no fda
 
03:49:45.920 --> 03:49:50.870 align:start position:0%
support even though it has no fda
approval

03:49:50.870 --> 03:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:52.870 --> 03:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
and thus the conundrum how do we as
 
03:49:52.880 --> 03:49:54.550 align:start position:0%
and thus the conundrum how do we as
legislators

03:49:54.550 --> 03:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
03:49:56.630 --> 03:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
interpret properly
 
03:49:56.640 --> 03:49:57.910 align:start position:0%
interpret properly
for

03:49:57.910 --> 03:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:50:00.630 --> 03:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
our constituents and i'm still thinking
 
03:50:01.830 --> 03:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
of patience
 
03:50:03.750 --> 03:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
being retired but
 
03:50:03.760 --> 03:50:05.030 align:start position:0%
being retired but
um

03:50:05.030 --> 03:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:07.269 --> 03:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
and that's the conundrum that we we have
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
to live with
 
03:50:08.880 --> 03:50:10.550 align:start position:0%
to live with
addressing

03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
03:50:13.110 --> 03:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
the science
 
03:50:16.229 --> 03:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
and and as i said science uh is
 
03:50:16.239 --> 03:50:17.349 align:start position:0%
and and as i said science uh is
basically

03:50:17.349 --> 03:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:50:19.269 --> 03:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
a social
 
03:50:19.279 --> 03:50:20.469 align:start position:0%
a social
cultural

03:50:20.469 --> 03:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
cultural
 
03:50:22.070 --> 03:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
construct used to engage your
 
03:50:22.080 --> 03:50:23.990 align:start position:0%
construct used to engage your
environment

03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
environment
 
03:50:26.389 --> 03:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
but it does not
 
03:50:29.750 --> 03:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
provide an ethical or moral guide
 
03:50:32.790 --> 03:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
it tells us what we know
 
03:50:35.189 --> 03:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
but not how to use what we know
 
03:50:36.389 --> 03:50:36.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:50:39.040 --> 03:50:39.050 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:39.050 --> 03:50:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

03:50:40.790 --> 03:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
03:50:42.790 --> 03:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions
 
03:50:44.790 --> 03:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry we got one minute or two
 
03:50:44.800 --> 03:50:48.389 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry we got one minute or two
minutes

03:50:48.389 --> 03:50:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:50.150 --> 03:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
she's not here but representative canuck
 
03:50:51.349 --> 03:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
you have to be calling me according to
 
03:50:51.359 --> 03:50:51.910 align:start position:0%
you have to be calling me according to
lucy

03:50:51.910 --> 03:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
lucy
 
03:50:51.920 --> 03:50:54.389 align:start position:0%
lucy
[Laughter]

03:50:54.389 --> 03:50:54.399 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:50:56.550 --> 03:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
whatever so i have a question though
 
03:50:57.910 --> 03:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
that was really
 
03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
not your thirty thousand foot you're
 
03:51:00.469 --> 03:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
right this is more like a three hundred
 
03:51:02.710 --> 03:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
thousand foot view if we get kind of
 
03:51:04.710 --> 03:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
down to maybe a thousand feet into the
 
03:51:06.870 --> 03:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
nuts and bolts of how we do studies and
 
03:51:09.110 --> 03:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
how we analyze them would you agree that
 
03:51:11.510 --> 03:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of experimental science
 
03:51:14.070 --> 03:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
that there are certain criteria one uses
 
03:51:16.469 --> 03:51:16.479 align:start position:0%
to be able to analyze whether or not a
 
03:51:18.710 --> 03:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
particular experiment or a particular
 
03:51:21.030 --> 03:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
study or a particular paper
 
03:51:22.870 --> 03:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
has a level of validity or at least you
 
03:51:24.469 --> 03:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
can compare the relative levels of
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
validity between different studies using
 
03:51:27.840 --> 03:51:28.630 align:start position:0%
validity between different studies using
set

03:51:28.630 --> 03:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
set
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
known criteria
 
03:51:32.389 --> 03:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
well that's that's the whole scientific
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
method is to have a
 
03:51:37.269 --> 03:51:37.279 align:start position:0%
a subset of experience in this case
 
03:51:40.070 --> 03:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
mathematical in many instances uh and
 
03:51:42.309 --> 03:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
math goes across all that do provide you
 
03:51:44.150 --> 03:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
that foundation
 
03:51:45.830 --> 03:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
but some of that is
 
03:51:49.990 --> 03:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:52.229 --> 03:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:51:54.469 --> 03:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
represent betty gay we're not in a
 
03:51:54.479 --> 03:51:56.309 align:start position:0%
represent betty gay we're not in a
hearing

03:51:56.309 --> 03:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:51:59.030 --> 03:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
and i apologize that i am never formal i
 
03:52:00.790 --> 03:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
never say thank you mr chairman and
 
03:52:06.630 --> 03:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
you may call me dr pearson when we're
 
03:52:09.120 --> 03:52:13.990 align:start position:0%
you may call me dr pearson when we're
not

03:52:13.990 --> 03:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:15.510 --> 03:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned the 5g and you didn't
 
03:52:20.870 --> 03:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
want to get into it i think you would
 
03:52:24.389 --> 03:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
have a heck of a big audience if we did
 
03:52:27.590 --> 03:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh if you were willing to talk about it
 
03:52:29.189 --> 03:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
because i know there are other people
 
03:52:31.110 --> 03:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
who are very concerned one of the
 
03:52:33.269 --> 03:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
senators that said that's why i ran
 
03:52:35.429 --> 03:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
because she's so concerned about the 5g
 
03:52:37.750 --> 03:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
radiation and i sure would like to learn
 
03:52:38.950 --> 03:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
about it
 
03:52:41.110 --> 03:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
well i um
 
03:52:43.830 --> 03:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
i i'd be happy to i i'm very familiar
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
with some of the aspects at the
 
03:52:49.670 --> 03:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
molecular level um because
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
both the undergraduate i did some
 
03:52:53.349 --> 03:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
independent study on the quantum
 
03:52:53.359 --> 03:52:54.389 align:start position:0%
independent study on the quantum
mechanics

03:52:54.389 --> 03:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
mechanics
 
03:52:56.469 --> 03:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
that involved in molecular interactions
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
and in proton tunneling i mentioned that
 
03:53:00.309 --> 03:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh and some of the work i did in
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
graduate school as well
 
03:53:04.950 --> 03:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely this is this is the
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
difficulty is that when you begin to
 
03:53:09.429 --> 03:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
look at this because our dna is held
 
03:53:12.309 --> 03:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
together by hydrogen bonds
 
03:53:12.319 --> 03:53:13.429 align:start position:0%
together by hydrogen bonds
and

03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:53:15.990 --> 03:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
if they can exchange it when they meet
 
03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
together the two parts the two strands
 
03:53:21.990 --> 03:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
that hydrogen bond is basically a proton
 
03:53:24.150 --> 03:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
and if you look at quantum mechanics
 
03:53:26.550 --> 03:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
if there's a
 
03:53:28.389 --> 03:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
barrier you say well it can't go through
 
03:53:30.389 --> 03:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
the barrier quantum mechanics says
 
03:53:31.830 --> 03:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
there's a certain probability that it
 
03:53:33.750 --> 03:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
will just somehow appear on the other
 
03:53:33.760 --> 03:53:34.790 align:start position:0%
will just somehow appear on the other
side

03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
side
 
03:53:37.349 --> 03:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
and that's proton tunneling
 
03:53:38.710 --> 03:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
trouble is what happens when it gets on
 
03:53:41.670 --> 03:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
the other side when the dna is red it's
 
03:53:43.750 --> 03:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
a misread
 
03:53:45.910 --> 03:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
oops error
 
03:53:48.630 --> 03:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
and that's proton tunnel
 
03:53:50.630 --> 03:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
well it's miss red
 
03:53:52.229 --> 03:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
okay because the protons on the other
 
03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
side it looks different
 
03:53:56.950 --> 03:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
and so when it goes when if
 
03:53:59.349 --> 03:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
dna is red at that time it'll be read as
 
03:54:02.070 --> 03:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
a different item
 
03:54:04.389 --> 03:54:04.399 align:start position:0%
and put into the code
 
03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
it can be repaired
 
03:54:08.550 --> 03:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
but that's a whole part very complex but
 
03:54:10.870 --> 03:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
the point is at the very basic science
 
03:54:13.670 --> 03:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
level things like proton tunneling and
 
03:54:15.510 --> 03:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's quantum mechanics
 
03:54:18.150 --> 03:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
the application of quantum mechanics has
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
impact on and this is not ionizing this
 
03:54:22.870 --> 03:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
is not heavy duty this is very low
 
03:54:22.880 --> 03:54:24.309 align:start position:0%
is not heavy duty this is very low
energy

03:54:24.309 --> 03:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:54:25.750 --> 03:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
so you don't have to have ionizing
 
03:54:28.389 --> 03:54:28.399 align:start position:0%
radiation that's all story for a long
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
time so another time we are now going to
 
03:54:34.389 --> 03:54:34.399 align:start position:0%
be stripped of all our other titles
 
03:54:34.399 --> 03:54:36.630 align:start position:0%
be stripped of all our other titles
representatives

03:54:36.630 --> 03:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
03:54:38.150 --> 03:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
and i call
 
03:54:41.910 --> 03:54:41.920 align:start position:0%

representative klein knight
 
03:54:55.429 --> 03:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:57.429 --> 03:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
thank you so much mr chairman and
 
03:54:59.510 --> 03:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i love to hear
 
03:55:01.670 --> 03:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
all the laughter this seems like the
 
03:55:04.150 --> 03:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
healthiest mental health committee i've
 
03:55:06.150 --> 03:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
ever been a part of it's the healthiest
 
03:55:08.469 --> 03:55:08.479 align:start position:0%
committee of any kind i i'd like to
 
03:55:11.670 --> 03:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
so um thank you for being here today
 
03:55:17.110 --> 03:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:55:17.120 --> 03:55:18.070 align:start position:0%
and uh
giving

03:55:18.070 --> 03:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
giving
 
03:55:20.870 --> 03:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh this idea the appropriate amount of
 
03:55:23.750 --> 03:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
time that it deserves
 
03:55:23.760 --> 03:55:25.670 align:start position:0%
time that it deserves
considering

03:55:25.670 --> 03:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
considering
 
03:55:27.670 --> 03:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
the data that we've been
 
03:55:29.670 --> 03:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
receiving as leaders i'm sure you're
 
03:55:32.150 --> 03:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
aware of our mental health crisis and
 
03:55:32.160 --> 03:55:34.150 align:start position:0%
aware of our mental health crisis and
emergency

03:55:34.150 --> 03:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
03:55:36.790 --> 03:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
what this aims to do is
 
03:55:38.070 --> 03:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
just provide
 
03:55:39.750 --> 03:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
more resources
 
03:55:39.760 --> 03:55:40.469 align:start position:0%
more resources
for

03:55:40.469 --> 03:55:40.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:55:43.750 --> 03:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
people that are in need in our state
 
03:55:45.990 --> 03:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
this is directly adopted from other
 
03:55:49.510 --> 03:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
states that are doing this as well
 
03:55:51.990 --> 03:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
so rather than invent the wheel
 
03:55:54.710 --> 03:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
i have tried to see
 
03:55:57.349 --> 03:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
what is working and what other people in
 
03:55:59.590 --> 03:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
the same exact predicament are are
 
03:56:02.469 --> 03:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
trying to resolve
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
so we have some
 
03:56:06.150 --> 03:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
some uh
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
studies and
 
03:56:10.790 --> 03:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
data points that we'd like to
 
03:56:12.550 --> 03:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
pass around that you're doing right now
 
03:56:14.790 --> 03:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
so for your reference that would help
 
03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
you make
 
03:56:19.990 --> 03:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:22.550 --> 03:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
and this this is
 
03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
this is aiming to prevent
 
03:56:26.550 --> 03:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
hospitalization this is aiming to get
 
03:56:28.950 --> 03:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
ahead of a problem that we are all very
 
03:56:28.960 --> 03:56:29.750 align:start position:0%
ahead of a problem that we are all very
well

03:56:29.750 --> 03:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:56:32.150 --> 03:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
informed of that is happening
 
03:56:32.160 --> 03:56:32.950 align:start position:0%
informed of that is happening
um

03:56:32.950 --> 03:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:35.990 --> 03:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
if anybody has um
 
03:56:39.429 --> 03:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
been following the djhs reports you know
 
03:56:39.439 --> 03:56:40.630 align:start position:0%
been following the djhs reports you know
that

03:56:40.630 --> 03:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:56:42.710 --> 03:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
the past two years we've been at our
 
03:56:45.990 --> 03:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
highest numbers specifically in
 
03:56:48.150 --> 03:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
pediatric mental health care as well the
 
03:56:50.229 --> 03:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
double digits getting
 
03:56:53.030 --> 03:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
up to 32 children waiting in the er
 
03:56:55.349 --> 03:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
around the state for weeks
 
03:56:56.710 --> 03:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
to be seen
 
03:56:59.110 --> 03:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
and so they just sit there and sit there
 
03:57:01.429 --> 03:57:01.439 align:start position:0%
and sit there without any recourse or
 
03:57:03.750 --> 03:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
resource to go to
 
03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
we don't want them
 
03:57:07.910 --> 03:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
i obviously we shared this common goal
 
03:57:09.429 --> 03:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
we don't want them to have to go there
 
03:57:11.429 --> 03:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
in the first place there should be
 
03:57:13.429 --> 03:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
resources in place that we should be
 
03:57:15.189 --> 03:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
able to offer
 
03:57:18.630 --> 03:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
families and children a place to go
 
03:57:21.990 --> 03:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
before even gets that bad and so we need
 
03:57:24.389 --> 03:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
to put our heads together
 
03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
this is a complete bipartisan issue it
 
03:57:26.880 --> 03:57:28.790 align:start position:0%
this is a complete bipartisan issue it
transcends

03:57:28.790 --> 03:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
transcends
 
03:57:30.630 --> 03:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
any political agenda
 
03:57:31.670 --> 03:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
it is
 
03:57:33.750 --> 03:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
something that we can get really
 
03:57:35.110 --> 03:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
creative with
 
03:57:36.790 --> 03:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
and collaborate with
 
03:57:39.670 --> 03:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
and it aims again to reduce the the
 
03:57:41.110 --> 03:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
amount of people that are going to be
 
03:57:42.710 --> 03:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
waiting for weeks
 
03:57:46.070 --> 03:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the er without getting care burdening
 
03:57:49.110 --> 03:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
our health care system and
 
03:57:49.990 --> 03:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:57:51.830 --> 03:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
03:57:53.670 --> 03:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
we don't win they don't win nobody's
 
03:57:55.670 --> 03:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
winning so how can we get ahead of this
 
03:57:57.349 --> 03:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
how can we address this how can we
 
03:58:00.229 --> 03:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
provide more resources for our people so
 
03:58:03.030 --> 03:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't become that bad
 
03:58:05.510 --> 03:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm open and amenable to any and all
 
03:58:07.590 --> 03:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
amendments and all ideas
 
03:58:07.600 --> 03:58:09.030 align:start position:0%
amendments and all ideas
again

03:58:09.030 --> 03:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:58:10.710 --> 03:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
this is something that i think we all
 
03:58:12.950 --> 03:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
need to come together on and i thank you
 
03:58:14.389 --> 03:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
for your time and i'm open to any
 
03:58:14.399 --> 03:58:21.269 align:start position:0%
for your time and i'm open to any
questions

03:58:21.269 --> 03:58:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:21.279 --> 03:58:22.469 align:start position:0%
 
please

03:58:22.469 --> 03:58:22.479 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:58:22.479 --> 03:58:23.750 align:start position:0%
please
ask

03:58:23.750 --> 03:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
ask
 
03:58:26.790 --> 03:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
am i on you are on um
 
03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for granting me my question
 
03:58:31.429 --> 03:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking it do you
 
03:58:34.790 --> 03:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
envision this as a 24 hour
 
03:58:38.550 --> 03:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
a day open facility
 
03:58:40.389 --> 03:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
i would love that i know there are
 
03:58:42.550 --> 03:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
certain urgent care centers that do
 
03:58:45.189 --> 03:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
operate on that level and i would love
 
03:58:48.229 --> 03:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
to see a similar model adapted but
 
03:58:50.630 --> 03:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
specifically for mental health care in
 
03:58:50.640 --> 03:58:52.150 align:start position:0%
specifically for mental health care in
general

03:58:52.150 --> 03:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:58:55.670 --> 03:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
a follow-up follow-up and um
 
03:58:57.349 --> 03:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
you know as a psychotherapist i'm
 
03:58:59.189 --> 03:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
wondering how
 
03:59:02.710 --> 03:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
who would you envision staffing this
 
03:59:04.790 --> 03:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh and to and then
 
03:59:07.910 --> 03:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
um you know a whole patient intake for
 
03:59:11.110 --> 03:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
each person that came in
 
03:59:13.590 --> 03:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know just some of the um nuts and
 
03:59:13.600 --> 03:59:14.710 align:start position:0%
you know just some of the um nuts and
bolts

03:59:14.710 --> 03:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
bolts
 
03:59:17.429 --> 03:59:17.439 align:start position:0%
yeah questions i'm hoping to get a
 
03:59:19.510 --> 03:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
wide spectrum of all mental health care
 
03:59:21.830 --> 03:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
professionals to work as teams
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
um on all levels whether that
 
03:59:27.830 --> 03:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
psychiatric or
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
whether that looks like counseling
 
03:59:32.070 --> 03:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
whether that looks like medication
 
03:59:34.950 --> 03:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
i'm aiming to help people that may have
 
03:59:36.870 --> 03:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
misplaced their medication and then
 
03:59:39.269 --> 03:59:39.279 align:start position:0%
can't go without it that same day and
 
03:59:41.750 --> 03:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
then don't necessarily need to go to the
 
03:59:43.269 --> 03:59:43.279 align:start position:0%
emergency room just to get their
 
03:59:43.279 --> 03:59:44.790 align:start position:0%
emergency room just to get their
medication

03:59:44.790 --> 03:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
medication
 
03:59:46.950 --> 03:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
because if if any of you are familiar
 
03:59:49.269 --> 03:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
with i'm going and relapsing off of
 
03:59:49.279 --> 03:59:50.630 align:start position:0%
with i'm going and relapsing off of
ssris

03:59:50.630 --> 03:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
ssris
 
03:59:52.389 --> 03:59:52.399 align:start position:0%
that can lead to many more health
 
03:59:55.750 --> 03:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
concerns and actual emergencies
 
03:59:57.910 --> 03:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
so this is this again this is a
 
04:00:00.070 --> 04:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
preventative idea
 
04:00:03.510 --> 04:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
to to to get ahead of a situation that
 
04:00:06.309 --> 04:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
is really out of control right now
 
04:00:09.349 --> 04:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um though i agree
 
04:00:17.910 --> 04:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly with this there is one
 
04:00:20.070 --> 04:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
concern i have which came up in another
 
04:00:20.080 --> 04:00:20.950 align:start position:0%
concern i have which came up in another
bill

04:00:20.950 --> 04:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:00:22.870 --> 04:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
in that a sense that it's it's funded
 
04:00:24.870 --> 04:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
via arpa funds
 
04:00:26.469 --> 04:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:00:28.870 --> 04:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
the concern is whether or not we
 
04:00:31.269 --> 04:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
actually have authority as a legislature
 
04:00:34.630 --> 04:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
to distribute our funds because i'm it's
 
04:00:36.630 --> 04:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
not the it's not usually in our purview
 
04:00:38.550 --> 04:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's from the executive department
 
04:00:40.710 --> 04:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
right and um thank you for that question
 
04:00:44.550 --> 04:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
and that also that can be amended um we
 
04:00:46.630 --> 04:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
are looking to
 
04:00:49.030 --> 04:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
make an ask of where the arpa funds are
 
04:00:50.950 --> 04:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
going and i'm certain as a legislative
 
04:00:54.229 --> 04:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
body we can at least um
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know recommend and and make that ask
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
because there is going to be a lot of
 
04:01:01.429 --> 04:01:01.439 align:start position:0%
money that um i'm sure we do have a say
 
04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
in where it's allocated and i'd like to
 
04:01:06.550 --> 04:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
not place a further tax burden on our
 
04:01:06.560 --> 04:01:08.070 align:start position:0%
not place a further tax burden on our
people

04:01:08.070 --> 04:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:01:08.080 --> 04:01:09.510 align:start position:0%
people
also

04:01:09.510 --> 04:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:01:11.189 --> 04:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
on an unrelated note there is other
 
04:01:12.710 --> 04:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
bills coming down the pipeline in the
 
04:01:12.720 --> 04:01:14.070 align:start position:0%
bills coming down the pipeline in the
legislative

04:01:14.070 --> 04:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
04:01:15.429 --> 04:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
body that
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
will provide more funding for for
 
04:01:18.560 --> 04:01:20.070 align:start position:0%
will provide more funding for for
um

04:01:20.070 --> 04:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:22.790 --> 04:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
for projects like this so i urge you all
 
04:01:22.800 --> 04:01:23.670 align:start position:0%
for projects like this so i urge you all
to

04:01:23.670 --> 04:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:01:26.950 --> 04:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
um take a look at those as well and keep
 
04:01:30.070 --> 04:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
our eyes open because uh this doesn't
 
04:01:33.750 --> 04:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
this this isn't this that mechanism for
 
04:01:36.870 --> 04:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
funding doesn't mean that we need to
 
04:01:39.910 --> 04:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
take this idea and kill it we we can
 
04:01:42.070 --> 04:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
certainly i'm sure come up with a
 
04:01:44.830 --> 04:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
creative solution on how to move this
 
04:01:48.389 --> 04:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
forward representative shapiro
 
04:01:50.150 --> 04:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:01:50.160 --> 04:01:51.510 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
representative

04:01:51.510 --> 04:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:01:51.520 --> 04:01:53.349 align:start position:0%
representative
um

04:01:53.349 --> 04:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:56.469 --> 04:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
i agree this tremendous unmet need
 
04:02:00.309 --> 04:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
um in my community in keene
 
04:02:02.469 --> 04:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
we have monadnock family services which
 
04:02:04.550 --> 04:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
is the community mental health center
 
04:02:06.950 --> 04:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
and then we have a peer support
 
04:02:06.960 --> 04:02:10.550 align:start position:0%
and then we have a peer support
organization

04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:13.189 --> 04:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
monarch peer support
 
04:02:15.750 --> 04:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
and between the two of them
 
04:02:17.349 --> 04:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
i think they do
 
04:02:21.670 --> 04:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
many but not all of the things um
 
04:02:24.790 --> 04:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
that you're describing
 
04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
so my question really is would you
 
04:02:30.550 --> 04:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
view a pilot program as being something
 
04:02:33.030 --> 04:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
completely new and independent
 
04:02:35.910 --> 04:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
but maybe or maybe somehow embedded into
 
04:02:38.070 --> 04:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
the organizations that already exist
 
04:02:38.080 --> 04:02:39.830 align:start position:0%
the organizations that already exist
someplace

04:02:39.830 --> 04:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
someplace
 
04:02:42.389 --> 04:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
um thank you so much our representative
 
04:02:43.990 --> 04:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
shapiro uh
 
04:02:46.630 --> 04:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
again that is open to this discretion of
 
04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
how best you feel as a committee to move
 
04:02:51.910 --> 04:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
forward um i would
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
i personally feel like we don't need to
 
04:02:55.910 --> 04:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel and the people that
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
are on the ground level of experiencing
 
04:02:59.830 --> 04:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
this crisis how we'll have a lot to
 
04:03:02.630 --> 04:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
offer and we should have maybe uh
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
railroad certain ideas right into the
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know the game plan here and
 
04:03:11.590 --> 04:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
definitely out of respect and education
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh value those people that are part of
 
04:03:19.590 --> 04:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:22.950 --> 04:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:24.550 --> 04:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
04:03:28.070 --> 04:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking one question
 
04:03:29.670 --> 04:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
along some of the lines that were here
 
04:03:32.229 --> 04:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
um i'm trying to understand the scope
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
and how much it would cost even if we're
 
04:03:35.189 --> 04:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:03:36.479 --> 04:03:37.269 align:start position:0%
that um
at

04:03:37.269 --> 04:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
for funds
 
04:03:38.560 --> 04:03:39.510 align:start position:0%
for funds
because

04:03:39.510 --> 04:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:03:41.510 --> 04:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
um i work for an organization that
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
provides a drop-in center
 
04:03:45.429 --> 04:03:45.439 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:03:47.830 --> 04:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
you know you've got brick and mortar
 
04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
facilities you've got people you've got
 
04:03:52.950 --> 04:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
to have somebody that manages it if
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
government funding we've got to have
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
part of the organization that ties into
 
04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
the granting organization that provides
 
04:04:01.520 --> 04:04:03.349 align:start position:0%
the granting organization that provides
it

04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:04:05.510 --> 04:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's this is just to start there's
 
04:04:07.990 --> 04:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
not there's not a lot of depth behind
 
04:04:08.000 --> 04:04:09.030 align:start position:0%
not there's not a lot of depth behind
this

04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:04:11.429 --> 04:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
the i the concept is great but
 
04:04:13.189 --> 04:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
where do we go from here
 
04:04:15.110 --> 04:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
i'm so glad you asked representative and
 
04:04:16.790 --> 04:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
that is exactly why i came to the
 
04:04:16.800 --> 04:04:18.070 align:start position:0%
that is exactly why i came to the
professionals

04:04:18.070 --> 04:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
04:04:18.080 --> 04:04:18.870 align:start position:0%
professionals
and

04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:04:20.790 --> 04:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
experts in this committee to help flesh
 
04:04:26.630 --> 04:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
it out and i was told by um the chairman
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago which uh was uh
 
04:04:31.990 --> 04:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
was greatly respectful that um this is a
 
04:04:33.990 --> 04:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
matter that is taken serious on both
 
04:04:36.309 --> 04:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle and there will be
 
04:04:39.990 --> 04:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
time to add things of such detail which
 
04:04:42.070 --> 04:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
i trust
 
04:04:42.080 --> 04:04:43.269 align:start position:0%
i trust
and

04:04:43.269 --> 04:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:04:45.670 --> 04:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
relinquish to you as as the experts in
 
04:04:48.870 --> 04:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:50.550 --> 04:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
04:04:52.630 --> 04:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:04:54.710 --> 04:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
my question and
 
04:04:56.550 --> 04:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion it really is a question
 
04:04:58.710 --> 04:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
because you're talking about arpa funds
 
04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
and it says very clearly note the
 
04:05:02.309 --> 04:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
federal government is directing our
 
04:05:04.950 --> 04:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
money to the states to address mental
 
04:05:07.670 --> 04:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
health and addiction consequences
 
04:05:10.389 --> 04:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't that mean automatically
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
that we could use the funds apply them
 
04:05:15.189 --> 04:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
to whatever
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
methods we have to provide the services
 
04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
and if we already have
 
04:05:20.160 --> 04:05:21.349 align:start position:0%
and if we already have
serv

04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
serv
 
04:05:25.510 --> 04:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
have a network that provides
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
would that mean that we could just hire
 
04:05:31.349 --> 04:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
more people have more phone service for
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
24-hour day
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:42.070 --> 04:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
if we could just fund more people
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
of course we also need to get more
 
04:05:46.550 --> 04:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
people to become counselors
 
04:05:48.630 --> 04:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
i thank you so much representative gay
 
04:05:50.790 --> 04:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
for your question i um i'm under the
 
04:05:52.870 --> 04:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
assumption just like you that that's
 
04:05:54.870 --> 04:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
that's how it reads to me as well it's
 
04:05:57.510 --> 04:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
not specific in the terms that we can
 
04:05:59.830 --> 04:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
place these funds where we need them the
 
04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
most and since there are certain ideas
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
in the state that are similar
 
04:06:07.110 --> 04:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
we can definitely
 
04:06:09.910 --> 04:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
take some models and adapt them to this
 
04:06:12.229 --> 04:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
this is why i think this is so important
 
04:06:15.750 --> 04:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
and and real crucial to look at and and
 
04:06:18.790 --> 04:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
build off of and the fact that
 
04:06:20.070 --> 04:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:06:23.110 --> 04:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
these funds are given to us with such a
 
04:06:25.189 --> 04:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
broad scope and term
 
04:06:27.910 --> 04:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
is is basically it's in being entrusted
 
04:06:30.070 --> 04:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
to us to spend it wisely and
 
04:06:32.150 --> 04:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
specifically on certain things that are
 
04:06:35.110 --> 04:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
so so needed
 
04:06:41.189 --> 04:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:42.550 --> 04:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:06:43.750 --> 04:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:06:45.670 --> 04:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
right here in front of you
 
04:06:51.429 --> 04:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
in regards to as i look through the
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
intent of this legislation
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
is the intent for them to get
 
04:07:02.469 --> 04:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
treatment at this location or basically
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
for someone to act as a triage in other
 
04:07:04.319 --> 04:07:05.429 align:start position:0%
for someone to act as a triage in other
words

04:07:05.429 --> 04:07:05.439 align:start position:0%
words
 
04:07:08.710 --> 04:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
a place where these people can walk into
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
at that point in time help the person
 
04:07:13.189 --> 04:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
find the therapy they need
 
04:07:14.710 --> 04:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
are you looking for somebody to actually
 
04:07:16.150 --> 04:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
be available them
 
04:07:18.229 --> 04:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
at this location to provide
 
04:07:20.870 --> 04:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
mental health therapy
 
04:07:22.229 --> 04:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a really good question
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
i think we we do have uh substantial
 
04:07:27.990 --> 04:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
resources when it comes to a long term
 
04:07:30.630 --> 04:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
um we do have other centers where people
 
04:07:33.830 --> 04:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
can go in and just like urgent cares um
 
04:07:36.389 --> 04:07:36.399 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping again that this models a
 
04:07:39.030 --> 04:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
similar form of medicine where if
 
04:07:41.110 --> 04:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
somebody is
 
04:07:43.510 --> 04:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't maybe have a provider that they
 
04:07:45.349 --> 04:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
see on a regular basis that this is
 
04:07:47.910 --> 04:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
still an option they can go to again
 
04:07:49.830 --> 04:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind that these are resources
 
04:07:52.070 --> 04:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're making available to the public so
 
04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
that they don't end up in the emergency
 
04:07:56.309 --> 04:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
room as their normal
 
04:07:59.110 --> 04:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
reliance of care
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:08:04.560 --> 04:08:05.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
so

04:08:05.750 --> 04:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:07.110 --> 04:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
are we looking to you at this point in
 
04:08:09.910 --> 04:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
time at the location having what i call
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
highly qualified mental health workers
 
04:08:14.229 --> 04:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
to help the patient that way for someone
 
04:08:16.469 --> 04:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
that would say in the legal profession
 
04:08:18.309 --> 04:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
paralegal somebody who has some basic
 
04:08:20.630 --> 04:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
training in mental health to help the
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
patient navigate what they need
 
04:08:25.189 --> 04:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
because right now my understanding is we
 
04:08:27.670 --> 04:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous shortage of qualified
 
04:08:28.790 --> 04:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
04:08:28.800 --> 04:08:29.990 align:start position:0%
mental health
professionals

04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
to help
 
04:08:33.269 --> 04:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
patients with their therapy
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned that we wouldn't have
 
04:08:37.349 --> 04:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
enough resources to staff it so are we
 
04:08:38.710 --> 04:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
looking for somebody at that level
 
04:08:40.630 --> 04:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
somebody's more of a paraprofessional
 
04:08:42.389 --> 04:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
that has some basic training by somebody
 
04:08:44.149 --> 04:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
eligible to give the training to help
 
04:08:46.710 --> 04:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
navigate that patient yes i i'm hoping
 
04:08:50.229 --> 04:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
more for um a person to come in and
 
04:08:53.189 --> 04:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
provide next steps of treatment and care
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
and work as a team to maybe have those
 
04:08:58.309 --> 04:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
actual connections to to then place them
 
04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
in a long-term solution
 
04:09:03.030 --> 04:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
so that again that
 
04:09:05.269 --> 04:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
we can get people in and out and that
 
04:09:07.510 --> 04:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
they they feel comfortable going to a
 
04:09:10.149 --> 04:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
place that's not waiting in in the
 
04:09:12.149 --> 04:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
emergency room where they're not
 
04:09:14.950 --> 04:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily coming every week for
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
long-term care treatment but there's a
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
place that they know that they can go to
 
04:09:21.429 --> 04:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
to maybe get the um
 
04:09:24.630 --> 04:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:27.510 --> 04:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
when you get referred to as as you would
 
04:09:27.520 --> 04:09:30.870 align:start position:0%
when you get referred to as as you would
say

04:09:30.870 --> 04:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative mckay
 
04:09:36.309 --> 04:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman
 
04:09:40.389 --> 04:09:40.399 align:start position:0%

uh this fine lady uh
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%

04:09:47.429 --> 04:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
wooden chairs over there
 
04:09:49.269 --> 04:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
in bedford
 
04:09:53.030 --> 04:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
and she logged in for every meeting we
 
04:09:55.830 --> 04:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
had over there this love seat that was
 
04:09:57.510 --> 04:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
very comfortable
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not so sure about how much love
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
there was
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
there but uh
 
04:10:02.560 --> 04:10:03.590 align:start position:0%
there but uh
but

04:10:03.590 --> 04:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:10:05.830 --> 04:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
i very much appreciated that it made
 
04:10:07.510 --> 04:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
life simply
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
if you look in this
 
04:10:11.830 --> 04:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
on line four
 
04:10:14.710 --> 04:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
shall provide a peer-focused recovery
 
04:10:14.720 --> 04:10:16.309 align:start position:0%
shall provide a peer-focused recovery
model

04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
model
 
04:10:19.189 --> 04:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's a very specific model that's a
 
04:10:19.199 --> 04:10:20.469 align:start position:0%
that's a very specific model that's a
model

04:10:20.469 --> 04:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
model
 
04:10:24.309 --> 04:10:24.319 align:start position:0%
very much like a alcoholics anonymous
 
04:10:26.790 --> 04:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
but but for people with mental illness
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
or addiction
 
04:10:29.670 --> 04:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
so that the
 
04:10:29.680 --> 04:10:31.030 align:start position:0%
so that the
notion

04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
notion
 
04:10:32.790 --> 04:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
is that somebody who
 
04:10:34.229 --> 04:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
has had
 
04:10:36.870 --> 04:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
a mental illness or an addiction
 
04:10:40.229 --> 04:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
is well qualified to help somebody
 
04:10:42.309 --> 04:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
because of their experience with the
 
04:10:42.319 --> 04:10:44.309 align:start position:0%
because of their experience with the
illness

04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
illness
 
04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
i have some doubts about
 
04:10:48.950 --> 04:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
that program
 
04:10:50.229 --> 04:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
but that
 
04:10:51.750 --> 04:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
in in general
 
04:10:53.590 --> 04:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire
 
04:10:57.110 --> 04:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
has developed a state mental health plan
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
this is a well-developed plan
 
04:11:00.479 --> 04:11:02.309 align:start position:0%
this is a well-developed plan
it's

04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:11:04.790 --> 04:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
was preceded by one that i was chairman
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
of that nothing ever happened and then
 
04:11:10.630 --> 04:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
it was preceded by two others
 
04:11:13.269 --> 04:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
the mental health planning
 
04:11:16.149 --> 04:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
activities should be consistent with the
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
mental health plan
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
and as a whole
 
04:11:21.510 --> 04:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
team of people
 
04:11:23.189 --> 04:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
in the department of health and human
 
04:11:23.199 --> 04:11:24.950 align:start position:0%
in the department of health and human
services

04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:11:27.670 --> 04:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
that this does not
 
04:11:27.680 --> 04:11:28.950 align:start position:0%
that this does not
indicate

04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
indicate
 
04:11:28.960 --> 04:11:30.550 align:start position:0%
indicate
a

04:11:30.550 --> 04:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:11:32.389 --> 04:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
a team of
 
04:11:34.389 --> 04:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals like social
 
04:11:36.950 --> 04:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
workers psychologists psychiatrists
 
04:11:39.750 --> 04:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
this is this is these are individuals
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
some of them may be
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
people with mental illness
 
04:11:45.670 --> 04:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
04:11:47.189 --> 04:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
it's great that you're bringing in
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
something that will get us to focus on
 
04:11:51.030 --> 04:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
the mental health
 
04:11:51.040 --> 04:11:52.309 align:start position:0%
the mental health
issues

04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
that's a the mental health plan is a
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
complex plan
 
04:11:59.910 --> 04:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be funded in total
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
if you don't do part of it it collapses
 
04:12:05.429 --> 04:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:12:07.189 --> 04:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
i have
 
04:12:09.590 --> 04:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
this would not be my
 
04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
first top priority
 
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
04:12:16.630 --> 04:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
where money should go
 
04:12:19.269 --> 04:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
and but i thank you for
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
bringing in legislation that makes us
 
04:12:23.429 --> 04:12:23.439 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
04:12:24.550 --> 04:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
think about
 
04:12:24.560 --> 04:12:25.349 align:start position:0%
think about
we

04:12:25.349 --> 04:12:25.359 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:12:25.359 --> 04:12:26.630 align:start position:0%
we
last

04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:12:28.830 --> 04:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
year we did pretty good with mental
 
04:12:31.830 --> 04:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
health i'm concerned that
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
what looks like we did pretty good may
 
04:12:34.319 --> 04:12:35.269 align:start position:0%
what looks like we did pretty good may
not

04:12:35.269 --> 04:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:12:37.269 --> 04:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
come out because we have this thing
 
04:12:39.429 --> 04:12:39.439 align:start position:0%
called the back of the budget
 
04:12:42.149 --> 04:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
where the department has to cut
 
04:12:44.469 --> 04:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of money hopefully
 
04:12:45.990 --> 04:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
that might be
 
04:12:47.349 --> 04:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
but thank you for
 
04:12:52.630 --> 04:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:55.110 --> 04:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative if i can respond to
 
04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
that yes please
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
i think with all due respect the numbers
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
coming out of dhhs
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
show that we're at the worst time in
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
history for the state in the mental
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
health that we've been providing
 
04:13:09.910 --> 04:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
and those
 
04:13:11.590 --> 04:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
numbers don't lie
 
04:13:11.600 --> 04:13:12.710 align:start position:0%
numbers don't lie
and

04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:15.110 --> 04:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
we also i would like i don't have
 
04:13:17.590 --> 04:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
the amount on me specifically but if you
 
04:13:18.870 --> 04:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
do go
 
04:13:22.149 --> 04:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
to the dhhs website and you look at
 
04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
funds that have been provided for these
 
04:13:26.550 --> 04:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
ideas the ideas are there and that's
 
04:13:29.030 --> 04:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct but there's
 
04:13:30.710 --> 04:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars that have just been
 
04:13:32.309 --> 04:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
sitting there for a couple of years now
 
04:13:34.389 --> 04:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
and actually haven't been spent
 
04:13:37.990 --> 04:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
and that is really concerning to me
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thanks for
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
taking another question
 
04:13:47.910 --> 04:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
i am intrigued by the idea that this is
 
04:13:50.790 --> 04:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
a pilot project and once again i'll go
 
04:13:53.269 --> 04:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
back and say that my community now that
 
04:13:55.030 --> 04:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
i read this carefully all of these
 
04:13:58.229 --> 04:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
things are really provided already
 
04:14:01.910 --> 04:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:03.990 --> 04:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
there aren't enough staff
 
04:14:06.389 --> 04:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
there is not immediate access which
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
would be implied in it for a drop-in
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
center that there'd be immediate access
 
04:14:13.510 --> 04:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
so i think the structures for all of
 
04:14:15.429 --> 04:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
these things are
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
in place at least in
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
in keene
 
04:14:22.469 --> 04:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
and provided in a very imperfect way
 
04:14:25.910 --> 04:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm my question to you is really like
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
how will
 
04:14:28.890 --> 04:14:28.900 align:start position:0%
whether we
 
04:14:28.900 --> 04:14:31.030 align:start position:0%
whether we
[Music]

04:14:31.030 --> 04:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:14:33.429 --> 04:14:33.439 align:start position:0%
a pilot project to me
 
04:14:35.910 --> 04:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
implies that it's going to be tried and
 
04:14:35.920 --> 04:14:37.349 align:start position:0%
implies that it's going to be tried and
studied

04:14:37.349 --> 04:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
studied
 
04:14:40.070 --> 04:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
what's your idea of what will happen
 
04:14:44.149 --> 04:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
after a pilot project
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
after we conceive of something that's
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
already there as this pilot project or
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
if we create something
 
04:14:52.870 --> 04:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
what's the next step after a pilot
 
04:14:54.469 --> 04:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
project thank you so much for your
 
04:14:57.189 --> 04:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
question representative shapiro um i do
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
think that we do have a lot of similar
 
04:15:00.790 --> 04:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
resources that are already there across
 
04:15:02.950 --> 04:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
the state um but they're all separate
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
they're floating around and they may be
 
04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
even hard for our people to access if
 
04:15:12.070 --> 04:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a one shop stop and i do think
 
04:15:15.269 --> 04:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
that having a one stop shop
 
04:15:18.149 --> 04:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
for resources such as this should be
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
studied and
 
04:15:22.550 --> 04:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
if it if it shows that we lower the
 
04:15:25.110 --> 04:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
emergency rate waiting times for people
 
04:15:26.710 --> 04:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
that are suffering from mental health
 
04:15:26.720 --> 04:15:28.309 align:start position:0%
that are suffering from mental health
issue

04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:15:30.070 --> 04:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
we'll be knowing we'll know that we're
 
04:15:32.070 --> 04:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
going in the right direction because
 
04:15:34.149 --> 04:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
with the ideas that have been brought
 
04:15:36.550 --> 04:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
forward they're great ideas for the last
 
04:15:38.389 --> 04:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
several years i know people have been
 
04:15:40.710 --> 04:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
working tirelessly on this issue but the
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
numbers don't represent
 
04:15:46.870 --> 04:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
the right direction that we're heading
 
04:15:55.150 --> 04:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:55.160 --> 04:16:00.309 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:16:00.309 --> 04:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:01.590 --> 04:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
now is it on
 
04:16:01.600 --> 04:16:03.830 align:start position:0%
now is it on
okay

04:16:03.830 --> 04:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:16:05.510 --> 04:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
i do agree i
 
04:16:07.510 --> 04:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
pilot program like this to come in the
 
04:16:09.670 --> 04:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
entire state
 
04:16:11.429 --> 04:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
some thought needs to go into where that
 
04:16:13.030 --> 04:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
might be located that this is really
 
04:16:16.149 --> 04:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
dropping it has to be readily accessible
 
04:16:18.469 --> 04:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
to a pretty wide range of people
 
04:16:18.479 --> 04:16:20.389 align:start position:0%
to a pretty wide range of people
and

04:16:20.389 --> 04:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:16:21.990 --> 04:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
i guess also
 
04:16:24.309 --> 04:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
staffing 24 hours right now we have
 
04:16:26.229 --> 04:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
programs that have been included in this
 
04:16:26.239 --> 04:16:27.269 align:start position:0%
programs that have been included in this
plan

04:16:27.269 --> 04:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:16:29.189 --> 04:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
to try to address the same problem
 
04:16:32.309 --> 04:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
without having a physical location
 
04:16:32.319 --> 04:16:33.189 align:start position:0%
without having a physical location
but

04:16:33.189 --> 04:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:16:35.830 --> 04:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
we're really struggling we're i'm
 
04:16:37.510 --> 04:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
talking about as if i still work there
 
04:16:37.520 --> 04:16:38.389 align:start position:0%
talking about as if i still work there
but

04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:16:39.590 --> 04:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know trying to get the staff
 
04:16:41.349 --> 04:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
together and finding professionals to
 
04:16:43.830 --> 04:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
come in to do this is really an enormous
 
04:16:43.840 --> 04:16:44.870 align:start position:0%
come in to do this is really an enormous
challenge

04:16:44.870 --> 04:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're including
 
04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
that plan is we have now what's called
 
04:16:52.389 --> 04:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
mobile community crisis response teams
 
04:16:54.469 --> 04:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
that are located presently in every
 
04:16:56.469 --> 04:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
mental health center around the state
 
04:17:00.309 --> 04:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
and the new plan also calls for a team
 
04:17:02.710 --> 04:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
that would either include within that or
 
04:17:04.950 --> 04:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
have a separate team to respond
 
04:17:06.710 --> 04:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
uniquely to children
 
04:17:09.670 --> 04:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
and adolescents who have that need this
 
04:17:11.429 --> 04:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
is a team of people that are available
 
04:17:13.830 --> 04:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
they are available 24 7
 
04:17:15.670 --> 04:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
and it's an alternative to having people
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
brought to the emergency room when
 
04:17:19.830 --> 04:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
they're experienced in a crisis
 
04:17:21.990 --> 04:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's a trained professional along with a
 
04:17:24.229 --> 04:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
peer support person that goes out
 
04:17:26.469 --> 04:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes with the police oftentimes
 
04:17:28.950 --> 04:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
without sometimes we're called in by the
 
04:17:31.110 --> 04:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
police to help them in dealing with
 
04:17:33.110 --> 04:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
something they don't understand in lieu
 
04:17:34.950 --> 04:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
of hauling them off to the emergency
 
04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
room where you're right they're going to
 
04:17:36.159 --> 04:17:37.189 align:start position:0%
room where you're right they're going to
wait

04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
wait
 
04:17:39.670 --> 04:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
instead what they try to do in that
 
04:17:41.269 --> 04:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
04:17:43.830 --> 04:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
is to develop a safety plan what can we
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
do to keep you safe over the next
 
04:17:49.030 --> 04:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
first 24 hours then a little bit later
 
04:17:50.950 --> 04:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
and continue to follow up
 
04:17:53.269 --> 04:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
and look for the plan and they have a
 
04:17:55.910 --> 04:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
kind of an interval of contacts in
 
04:17:57.750 --> 04:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
between and i think the people the
 
04:18:00.550 --> 04:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
division behavioral health
 
04:18:02.070 --> 04:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
department can answer this better me
 
04:18:03.990 --> 04:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
i've been retired can we come to a
 
04:18:06.389 --> 04:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
question the question i'm sorry if i
 
04:18:08.070 --> 04:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
didn't do that
 
04:18:10.710 --> 04:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
i guess the question i have is would you
 
04:18:13.110 --> 04:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
don't do you feel that having these
 
04:18:15.670 --> 04:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
teams located throughout the state
 
04:18:18.229 --> 04:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
on that kind of a basis would accomplish
 
04:18:19.830 --> 04:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
many of the same goals without a
 
04:18:22.070 --> 04:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
physical location and without it seems
 
04:18:23.590 --> 04:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
to me as if we're struggling to
 
04:18:25.750 --> 04:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
accomplish the same thing without doing
 
04:18:27.269 --> 04:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
it with a single location would you
 
04:18:27.279 --> 04:18:28.950 align:start position:0%
it with a single location would you
agree

04:18:28.950 --> 04:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
agree
 
04:18:31.349 --> 04:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
um i would
 
04:18:33.429 --> 04:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
i think there's it's not so black and
 
04:18:35.269 --> 04:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
white so i'm not going to give it a yes
 
04:18:38.790 --> 04:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
or no answer i'm going to say that the
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
crisis response teams are great idea
 
04:18:44.070 --> 04:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
um it's been something in the works for
 
04:18:46.229 --> 04:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
quite some time first there was only one
 
04:18:48.790 --> 04:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
and within the last two months the
 
04:18:51.510 --> 04:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
second one has just been adopted and
 
04:18:54.149 --> 04:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
they at the beginning of the last two
 
04:18:56.469 --> 04:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
years at this session they were not
 
04:18:58.710 --> 04:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
meeting the scope of the need and the
 
04:19:01.510 --> 04:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
numbers in the er showed that and i
 
04:19:03.990 --> 04:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
would love it if this crisis team could
 
04:19:06.550 --> 04:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
work with a model such as this again i
 
04:19:08.469 --> 04:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
think we could get really creative here
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
we could use all the resources that
 
04:19:13.189 --> 04:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
we've been working with already and just
 
04:19:15.189 --> 04:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
because an idea is already in place
 
04:19:16.870 --> 04:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we don't need more and
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
again the numbers reflect that we need
 
04:19:18.960 --> 04:19:20.149 align:start position:0%
again the numbers reflect that we need
more

04:19:20.149 --> 04:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:27.269 --> 04:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
representative merchant looks very eager
 
04:19:31.110 --> 04:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
so i will let him go before me
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
in the spirit of bipartisan cooperation
 
04:19:35.830 --> 04:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:19:38.710 --> 04:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
04:19:38.720 --> 04:19:40.309 align:start position:0%
representative king
um

04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:41.830 --> 04:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
as i listen to
 
04:19:44.550 --> 04:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
the presentation lawyer by
 
04:19:46.469 --> 04:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
representative woods listen to
 
04:19:48.550 --> 04:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
representative snow a couple neurons
 
04:19:50.070 --> 04:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
actually hit each other
 
04:19:52.229 --> 04:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
and following up on the technology we
 
04:19:54.149 --> 04:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
talked about before
 
04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
is there a possibility in this pilot
 
04:19:58.630 --> 04:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
program set up someone going to see a
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
therapist or somebody at the location
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
using the technology we have today where
 
04:20:05.189 --> 04:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
somebody could walk into a facility
 
04:20:07.030 --> 04:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's equipped for them to have
 
04:20:08.790 --> 04:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
telehealth telecommunications so
 
04:20:08.800 --> 04:20:09.750 align:start position:0%
telehealth telecommunications so
therefore

04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
04:20:11.269 --> 04:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to bring the patients
 
04:20:12.790 --> 04:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
to the provider providers to the patient
 
04:20:15.110 --> 04:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
we use the technology out there that
 
04:20:17.510 --> 04:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
creates that link and therefore
 
04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
we are using and tapping into existing
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
resources but using technology to do it
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
is that any possibility yes i would love
 
04:20:26.710 --> 04:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
that idea to be adopted in this model
 
04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
again using all resources at our
 
04:20:29.680 --> 04:20:30.950 align:start position:0%
again using all resources at our
disposal

04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
disposal
 
04:20:32.790 --> 04:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
the ideas that we have brought forth in
 
04:20:34.389 --> 04:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
the legislation in the last couple of
 
04:20:37.510 --> 04:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
years and making this all connected to a
 
04:20:40.389 --> 04:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
spot where we can refer people to
 
04:20:43.750 --> 04:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
anything such as telehealth services
 
04:20:43.760 --> 04:20:45.830 align:start position:0%
anything such as telehealth services
yep

04:20:45.830 --> 04:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:20:47.910 --> 04:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:20:49.910 --> 04:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:20:52.710 --> 04:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
what really also triggered my fanciness
 
04:20:54.149 --> 04:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
whole thing i was in a pharmacy the
 
04:20:56.630 --> 04:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
other day which was kind of interesting
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
inside of the pharmacy the pharmacy is
 
04:21:00.070 --> 04:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
always interesting
 
04:21:02.229 --> 04:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh if you get to speak to the pharmacist
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
but in saying that they actually had a
 
04:21:06.070 --> 04:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
room set up and this goes back to what i
 
04:21:07.510 --> 04:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
think representative canark talked about
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
the other day
 
04:21:10.950 --> 04:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
which caught my attention inside of the
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
room was a
 
04:21:14.790 --> 04:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
tv screen
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
hooked to a provider
 
04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
and in the room they actually had an
 
04:21:19.439 --> 04:21:20.630 align:start position:0%
and in the room they actually had an
autoscope

04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
autoscope
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
that could through bluetooth technology
 
04:21:25.750 --> 04:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
transmit to the provider so the person
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
could see inside of the ear
 
04:21:30.229 --> 04:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
they had a same thing with their scope
 
04:21:31.990 --> 04:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
that you could actually somebody could
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
help the patient at that point in time
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
use the equipment but the provider on
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
the other side was actually
 
04:21:40.469 --> 04:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
visually seeing what was going on
 
04:21:42.070 --> 04:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
which i thought was kind of a nice great
 
04:21:43.750 --> 04:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
use of technology where somebody could
 
04:21:46.389 --> 04:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
walk into a pharmacy and get access to a
 
04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
provider without having to actually go
 
04:21:48.239 --> 04:21:49.110 align:start position:0%
provider without having to actually go
to

04:21:49.110 --> 04:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:21:50.469 --> 04:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
i just i'm trying to follow up on the
 
04:21:51.990 --> 04:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
same thing so there's a question there
 
04:21:52.000 --> 04:21:53.110 align:start position:0%
same thing so there's a question there
somewhere

04:21:53.110 --> 04:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
04:21:55.510 --> 04:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
well i wouldn't you believe
 
04:21:55.520 --> 04:21:56.309 align:start position:0%
well i wouldn't you believe
yes

04:21:56.309 --> 04:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:21:58.469 --> 04:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
i would believe it and i would suggest
 
04:22:00.309 --> 04:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
too that the crisis mental health
 
04:22:02.870 --> 04:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
response teams aren't pharmacies and
 
04:22:04.550 --> 04:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
they're limited to their scope and what
 
04:22:06.149 --> 04:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
they may or may not be able to treat on
 
04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
the ground right in that
 
04:22:08.239 --> 04:22:10.389 align:start position:0%
the ground right in that
immediate

04:22:10.389 --> 04:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
immediate
 
04:22:12.309 --> 04:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
you know in an emergency setting that
 
04:22:14.149 --> 04:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
might not necessarily require an
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
emergency room visit so
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
again which is why something like this
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
would be super beneficial working with
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
what we already have in place and i mean
 
04:22:26.309 --> 04:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you believe that a similar
 
04:22:28.149 --> 04:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
situation to what you described doctors
 
04:22:29.910 --> 04:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
without borders in other countries just
 
04:22:33.189 --> 04:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
right here in our beautiful
 
04:22:35.429 --> 04:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
country do help over
 
04:22:38.309 --> 04:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
other well-needed places through that
 
04:22:40.710 --> 04:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
kind of situation via
 
04:22:44.469 --> 04:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
video conferencing and if we did in fact
 
04:22:47.269 --> 04:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
have a shortage of people why not have a
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
facility to operate in the same way
 
04:22:52.229 --> 04:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
until we have those needs met by our own
 
04:22:52.239 --> 04:22:53.590 align:start position:0%
until we have those needs met by our own
people

04:22:53.590 --> 04:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:22:55.990 --> 04:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:23:00.630 --> 04:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative merchant for
 
04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh kind of setting me up actually every
 
04:23:05.189 --> 04:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
question so far is because
 
04:23:07.030 --> 04:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
my question has morphed
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
about four times already
 
04:23:08.880 --> 04:23:10.389 align:start position:0%
about four times already
um

04:23:10.389 --> 04:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:11.830 --> 04:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
first of all i'm your neighbor in
 
04:23:11.840 --> 04:23:12.950 align:start position:0%
first of all i'm your neighbor in
milford

04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
milford
 
04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:23:16.710 --> 04:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you're aware of some of
 
04:23:20.229 --> 04:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
the programs that uh monica gallant and
 
04:23:22.630 --> 04:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
at the boys and girls club is working on
 
04:23:26.630 --> 04:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh such as uh soul safe and cast and
 
04:23:29.189 --> 04:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
and others um you know i
 
04:23:32.149 --> 04:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
i'm a little disturbed
 
04:23:33.590 --> 04:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
i probably shouldn't end it right there
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
but um i'm a little disturbed that
 
04:23:39.110 --> 04:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
milford high school only has one trained
 
04:23:42.630 --> 04:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
professional to identify mental
 
04:23:45.990 --> 04:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
health within our our school system
 
04:23:46.000 --> 04:23:47.590 align:start position:0%
health within our our school system
and

04:23:47.590 --> 04:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:23:49.510 --> 04:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
when you look at
 
04:23:52.790 --> 04:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder
 
04:23:54.870 --> 04:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
root cause you know the professionals
 
04:23:56.469 --> 04:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
that i talk to
 
04:23:56.479 --> 04:23:57.429 align:start position:0%
that i talk to
the

04:23:57.429 --> 04:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:58.630 --> 04:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
the cause
 
04:24:00.550 --> 04:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
is mental health
 
04:24:00.560 --> 04:24:01.349 align:start position:0%
is mental health
and

04:24:01.349 --> 04:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:02.950 --> 04:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
04:24:05.110 --> 04:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
where i've come from after all of what
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
i've heard i've learned so much and
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro i definitely want
 
04:24:11.830 --> 04:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
to talk to you afterwards um
 
04:24:14.950 --> 04:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
how do we unite ourselves to
 
04:24:18.309 --> 04:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh to tackle this statewide
 
04:24:20.149 --> 04:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
will this pilot program
 
04:24:22.309 --> 04:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
provide that
 
04:24:24.630 --> 04:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your uh question
 
04:24:27.189 --> 04:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
representative king and thank you so
 
04:24:29.830 --> 04:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
much for being such a pleasant neighbor
 
04:24:33.269 --> 04:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
um i have taken a look at a lot of those
 
04:24:37.429 --> 04:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
and i um i hate to use the word um but i
 
04:24:40.469 --> 04:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
also am disturbed i'm disturbed with the
 
04:24:44.389 --> 04:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
proportionate amount of of children
 
04:24:48.229 --> 04:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
that have been increased in hopelessness
 
04:24:51.670 --> 04:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
and suicide ideology and the numbers are
 
04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
increasing every year and so um with all
 
04:24:57.269 --> 04:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
due respect like just the our ideas that
 
04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
we've already implemented are are not
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
suffice their to to say the least
 
04:25:04.070 --> 04:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're we're not hitting our goals if
 
04:25:06.790 --> 04:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
the numbers of more disparaged children
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
are ever increasing
 
04:25:10.950 --> 04:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
i do hope that
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
again since this would be a pilot
 
04:25:16.710 --> 04:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
program that this is not something that
 
04:25:16.720 --> 04:25:17.590 align:start position:0%
program that this is not something that
we

04:25:17.590 --> 04:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:25:19.910 --> 04:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
we can we can certainly keep adapting
 
04:25:19.920 --> 04:25:20.710 align:start position:0%
we can we can certainly keep adapting
and

04:25:20.710 --> 04:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:20.720 --> 04:25:21.510 align:start position:0%
and
and

04:25:21.510 --> 04:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:24.149 --> 04:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
trying to fit best practices and best
 
04:25:26.309 --> 04:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
needs which is why there there wouldn't
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
be such a that we shouldn't knock this
 
04:25:29.279 --> 04:25:30.389 align:start position:0%
be such a that we shouldn't knock this
before

04:25:30.389 --> 04:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:25:33.110 --> 04:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
trying to collaborate
 
04:25:34.710 --> 04:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
on all levels of what's already been
 
04:25:34.720 --> 04:25:36.229 align:start position:0%
on all levels of what's already been
implemented

04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
to to just do more because we're we are
 
04:25:39.359 --> 04:25:43.030 align:start position:0%
to to just do more because we're we are
failing

04:25:43.030 --> 04:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:45.110 --> 04:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else thank you representative
 
04:25:45.120 --> 04:25:50.790 align:start position:0%
anyone else thank you representative
cannon

04:25:50.790 --> 04:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking
 
04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
another question
 
04:25:55.110 --> 04:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the doorway
 
04:25:55.120 --> 04:25:56.630 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the doorway
program

04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:25:58.630 --> 04:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
i believe i am if you'd like to talk
 
04:26:00.950 --> 04:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
about it please go forward
 
04:26:03.429 --> 04:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
well part of the part of that program is
 
04:26:06.389 --> 04:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
focused on mental health as well as
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
all sorts of other
 
04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
substance abuse and so forth and and i'm
 
04:26:12.870 --> 04:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
04:26:15.269 --> 04:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
if what you're talking about here might
 
04:26:18.550 --> 04:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
be it might be something that they
 
04:26:21.349 --> 04:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
aren't fully implementing but have
 
04:26:23.670 --> 04:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
have part of the puzzle
 
04:26:25.110 --> 04:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
for implementing
 
04:26:28.309 --> 04:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
and it's probably worthwhile looking at
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
is this something that would work uh in
 
04:26:34.070 --> 04:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
addition to what they currently offer of
 
04:26:37.110 --> 04:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
course i think this is here so that it
 
04:26:39.189 --> 04:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
could be worked in addition to whatever
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
is being reached and maybe again since
 
04:26:43.990 --> 04:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
you guys are all the experts and have
 
04:26:46.550 --> 04:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
more knowledge in this uh field than i
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
do you could pull all those resources to
 
04:26:50.630 --> 04:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
the people that are already doing things
 
04:26:52.229 --> 04:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
and get them involved in something like
 
04:26:54.469 --> 04:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
this so that the whole state's talking
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
about it we're all on the same page and
 
04:26:58.710 --> 04:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
that if one if this isn't a one size
 
04:27:00.630 --> 04:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
fits all for mental health if something
 
04:27:02.149 --> 04:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
works for one child it might not work
 
04:27:04.229 --> 04:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
for another child and that is exactly
 
04:27:06.149 --> 04:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
why we need to collaborate and bring
 
04:27:07.830 --> 04:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
everybody together on the resources that
 
04:27:11.349 --> 04:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:14.469 --> 04:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
representative mcmahon
 
04:27:15.990 --> 04:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:27:17.750 --> 04:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh miss uh representative klein knight
 
04:27:21.750 --> 04:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
specific to line nine on page one
 
04:27:21.760 --> 04:27:22.550 align:start position:0%
specific to line nine on page one
uh

04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:27:24.309 --> 04:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
could you comment on who was the
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
authority having jurisdiction
 
04:27:29.510 --> 04:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
to specifically identify
 
04:27:31.349 --> 04:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
the area
 
04:27:32.790 --> 04:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
that a
 
04:27:35.590 --> 04:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
single pilot program would be
 
04:27:35.600 --> 04:27:37.830 align:start position:0%
single pilot program would be
placed

04:27:37.830 --> 04:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
placed
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
i believe that maybe this body
 
04:27:43.990 --> 04:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
again i would urge you to
 
04:27:46.790 --> 04:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
work with dhhs on this it is up to you
 
04:27:50.229 --> 04:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
and again it is a pilot program so
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
i would take a look at the demographics
 
04:27:54.790 --> 04:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
and urge to suggest that you put it in
 
04:27:56.229 --> 04:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
the strongest place where there's the
 
04:27:58.630 --> 04:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
most need
 
04:28:00.630 --> 04:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you mr chairman
 
04:28:03.429 --> 04:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh specific to following a model that
 
04:28:06.950 --> 04:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
was dealt uh dealing with disabilities
 
04:28:09.189 --> 04:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
which is the area agencies
 
04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
we have 10 of them throughout the state
 
04:28:15.830 --> 04:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
in identifying where the
 
04:28:18.389 --> 04:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
identified need for increased access do
 
04:28:22.229 --> 04:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
you have a comment as the
 
04:28:24.149 --> 04:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
submitter of the bill
 
04:28:25.750 --> 04:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
as to where you believe in your
 
04:28:29.189 --> 04:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
experience the pilot program would
 
04:28:31.110 --> 04:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
be best initiated
 
04:28:33.189 --> 04:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
well um as a representative from
 
04:28:35.750 --> 04:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
manchester i see a great need and i have
 
04:28:37.990 --> 04:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
a high population but i don't want to
 
04:28:40.070 --> 04:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
get greedy and i'm willing to open up
 
04:28:42.309 --> 04:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
the floor to all the representatives for
 
04:28:44.389 --> 04:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
the entire state and come to a
 
04:28:46.229 --> 04:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
compromise on where exactly to put
 
04:28:48.469 --> 04:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
something like this
 
04:28:50.149 --> 04:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman representative
 
04:28:50.159 --> 04:28:54.469 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman representative
mckay

04:28:54.469 --> 04:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:56.630 --> 04:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
 
04:28:58.630 --> 04:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative snow and i will be
 
04:29:00.309 --> 04:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
activating the
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
mental health caucus
 
04:29:04.389 --> 04:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
for a lot of reasons which are pretty
 
04:29:04.399 --> 04:29:06.070 align:start position:0%
for a lot of reasons which are pretty
obvious

04:29:06.070 --> 04:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
obvious
 
04:29:08.149 --> 04:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
we haven't got started but
 
04:29:10.229 --> 04:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
now is the time to do it
 
04:29:13.189 --> 04:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
and this bill and other bills
 
04:29:15.030 --> 04:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
would certainly be
 
04:29:17.910 --> 04:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
very useful for our discussion so i just
 
04:29:21.349 --> 04:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
thought we'd give a little advertisement
 
04:29:25.269 --> 04:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:33.030 --> 04:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:33.040 --> 04:29:34.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:29:34.309 --> 04:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:29:36.870 --> 04:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and thank you
 
04:29:36.880 --> 04:29:37.910 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and thank you
um

04:29:37.910 --> 04:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:39.990 --> 04:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
it because it's a pilot program and we
 
04:29:41.830 --> 04:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
have just certain amount of money that
 
04:29:43.590 --> 04:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
we want to spend and
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
see what works
 
04:29:47.349 --> 04:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
would this prohibit
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
a much expanded telephone service for
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
people in crisis
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
and then i really like your um idea that
 
04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
you mentioned here about
 
04:30:01.349 --> 04:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
see if i can find the words
 
04:30:01.359 --> 04:30:02.630 align:start position:0%
see if i can find the words
um

04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
peer support
 
04:30:04.640 --> 04:30:05.590 align:start position:0%
peer support
uh

04:30:05.590 --> 04:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
on the basis of like al-anon and
 
04:30:10.389 --> 04:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
and d.a and
 
04:30:13.510 --> 04:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
um i would think that it could be a
 
04:30:16.149 --> 04:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
diffusing would you would you think that
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
it would be a kind of um
 
04:30:20.950 --> 04:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh first
 
04:30:23.189 --> 04:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
when people are feeling troubled that it
 
04:30:26.389 --> 04:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
would be a safe place to go to
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
to talk to be with other other
 
04:30:29.760 --> 04:30:31.030 align:start position:0%
to talk to be with other other
teens

04:30:31.030 --> 04:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
teens
 
04:30:31.040 --> 04:30:31.990 align:start position:0%
teens
people

04:30:31.990 --> 04:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:30:33.429 --> 04:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
of all ages
 
04:30:35.990 --> 04:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
so that the money could go and serve
 
04:30:39.110 --> 04:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
many places so even though the brick and
 
04:30:42.550 --> 04:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
mortar sounds really appealing
 
04:30:44.229 --> 04:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
and maybe we'd have enough money to set
 
04:30:45.590 --> 04:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
one up
 
04:30:47.830 --> 04:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
but in order to serve as many people as
 
04:30:50.070 --> 04:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
possible would that be
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
would that suit your goal
 
04:30:53.910 --> 04:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
to have
 
04:30:53.920 --> 04:30:54.950 align:start position:0%
to have
a

04:30:54.950 --> 04:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:30:58.229 --> 04:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
a telephone line that people could call
 
04:31:00.630 --> 04:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
and also encourage
 
04:31:00.640 --> 04:31:02.229 align:start position:0%
and also encourage
um

04:31:02.229 --> 04:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:03.670 --> 04:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
just like we have
 
04:31:06.790 --> 04:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
al and on and aa and d.a
 
04:31:09.670 --> 04:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
all over the place could we set up some
 
04:31:12.229 --> 04:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
of those to invite so the people would
 
04:31:14.870 --> 04:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
get person-to-person contact not just a
 
04:31:14.880 --> 04:31:16.550 align:start position:0%
get person-to-person contact not just a
phone

04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
phone
 
04:31:18.070 --> 04:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:31:20.389 --> 04:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
representative gay and
 
04:31:23.110 --> 04:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
taking the time to not only mention
 
04:31:25.269 --> 04:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
certain values that this bill proposes
 
04:31:27.830 --> 04:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
but also more ideas to include in this
 
04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
and that is exactly the com kind of
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
conversation i was hoping to get because
 
04:31:35.510 --> 04:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
would you believe out of necessity
 
04:31:37.670 --> 04:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of resources that we
 
04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:43.590 --> 04:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
they do
 
04:31:45.990 --> 04:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
the out of this they need to they have
 
04:31:48.870 --> 04:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
no other recourse but to go to peers
 
04:31:50.830 --> 04:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
because there's a lack of
 
04:31:53.830 --> 04:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
professionals so what exactly what this
 
04:31:57.269 --> 04:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
aims to do is not to necessarily drain
 
04:31:59.830 --> 04:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
any sort of financial budget as well but
 
04:31:59.840 --> 04:32:00.550 align:start position:0%
any sort of financial budget as well but
to

04:32:00.550 --> 04:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
have some
 
04:32:01.920 --> 04:32:03.030 align:start position:0%
have some
um

04:32:03.030 --> 04:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
balance of volunteers professionals
 
04:32:09.670 --> 04:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know standards that need to be
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
met but certainly um a community network
 
04:32:15.990 --> 04:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
so to speak as as what you're suggesting
 
04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
um to to adopt the ideas that have
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
already been in practice
 
04:32:23.189 --> 04:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
and to collaborate and get us all more
 
04:32:26.229 --> 04:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
organized so that we can refer people to
 
04:32:31.750 --> 04:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:33.110 --> 04:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:32:35.110 --> 04:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative in presenting this bill
 
04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
to us today
 
04:32:39.910 --> 04:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:32:48.630 --> 04:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:51.189 --> 04:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you for

on mental health care and here in the
 
04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
granite state for the record my name is
 
04:33:03.030 --> 04:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative megan murray i represent
 
04:33:05.349 --> 04:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
the town of amherst i come before you in
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
support of hb 1537
 
04:33:10.150 --> 04:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
seeking integrated and forward-thinking
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
multi-faceted approaches to the complex
 
04:33:14.230 --> 04:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
and anemic state of mental health care
 
04:33:16.070 --> 04:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
services and access to them here in new
 
04:33:16.080 --> 04:33:17.269 align:start position:0%
services and access to them here in new
hampshire

04:33:17.269 --> 04:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:33:18.789 --> 04:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
i applaud the state of new hampshire for
 
04:33:20.230 --> 04:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
its recent launch of initiatives like
 
04:33:22.949 --> 04:33:22.959 align:start position:0%
the nine new hampshire 988 rapid
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
response access point for those in
 
04:33:26.551 --> 04:33:26.561 align:start position:0%
crisis however
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
my goal is to see folks thrive and avoid
 
04:33:30.230 --> 04:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
states of crises or long waits for
 
04:33:32.230 --> 04:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated receiving facilities by having
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
ample community-based resources for
 
04:33:36.230 --> 04:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
mental health wellness
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
available to them before situations are
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
critical and complex and potentially
 
04:33:42.789 --> 04:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
require inpatient care
 
04:33:44.949 --> 04:33:44.959 align:start position:0%
while 988 response is helpful especially
 
04:33:47.109 --> 04:33:47.119 align:start position:0%
in crisis that alone though a step in
 
04:33:49.109 --> 04:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
the right direction is not enough
 
04:33:50.709 --> 04:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
and as i come before the committee i
 
04:33:52.709 --> 04:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
also issue a content warning
 
04:33:55.910 --> 04:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
as this discussion mentions suicide
 
04:33:57.910 --> 04:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
the students have excuse me the citizens
 
04:33:59.590 --> 04:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and my district are
 
04:34:01.830 --> 04:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
seeking expanded access to care options
 
04:34:03.510 --> 04:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
including peer support centers like the
 
04:34:05.670 --> 04:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
ones sought through this bill
 
04:34:08.070 --> 04:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
over the last few years alone
 
04:34:08.080 --> 04:34:09.269 align:start position:0%
over the last few years alone
painfully

04:34:09.269 --> 04:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
painfully
 
04:34:11.510 --> 04:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
my district has seen a rise in of
 
04:34:13.990 --> 04:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
desperation and suicide particularly in
 
04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
children and excuse me young adults
 
04:34:18.551 --> 04:34:18.561 align:start position:0%
and our community and those in rural and
 
04:34:20.310 --> 04:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
underserved settings seek more resources
 
04:34:22.629 --> 04:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
for community members to engage in with
 
04:34:25.109 --> 04:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
regard to their mental health wellness
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
last year new futures held a symposium
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
in milford which i was honored to attend
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
where youth and their parents talked
 
04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
about their lived learned um experiences
 
04:34:37.029 --> 04:34:37.039 align:start position:0%
and the need for peer-supported options
 
04:34:38.869 --> 04:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
they thought grad greater access to
 
04:34:40.310 --> 04:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
programs inside school learning
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
communities and with their own
 
04:34:44.230 --> 04:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
residential communities too
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
i believe there was a representative
 
04:34:47.590 --> 04:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
from the state i can't recall if it was
 
04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%
the department of education or
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
that was there but they were in
 
04:34:51.840 --> 04:34:55.269 align:start position:0%
that was there but they were in
attendance

04:34:55.269 --> 04:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:58.070 --> 04:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
looking back in time briefly to 2018 the
 
04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
national council on mental well-being
 
04:35:00.949 --> 04:35:00.959 align:start position:0%
cited that those
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
situations were dire with regard to
 
04:35:03.510 --> 04:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
04:35:06.230 --> 04:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
access then and frankly access to
 
04:35:07.910 --> 04:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
resources and providers by and large
 
04:35:10.789 --> 04:35:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:13.349 --> 04:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
currently in 2022 now more than ever the
 
04:35:15.189 --> 04:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
evidence is clear that mental well
 
04:35:17.349 --> 04:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
mental health wellness and related needs
 
04:35:18.551 --> 04:35:18.561 align:start position:0%
are among the highest concerns of
 
04:35:20.709 --> 04:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
government leaders across america
 
04:35:22.949 --> 04:35:22.959 align:start position:0%
over 52 percent of the mayor surveyed in
 
04:35:25.029 --> 04:35:25.039 align:start position:0%
boston university's initiative of city
 
04:35:27.269 --> 04:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
survey of mayor's report cited mental
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
health as their primary and most
 
04:35:30.150 --> 04:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
pressing concern
 
04:35:31.590 --> 04:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
while it's true that the fiscal note
 
04:35:33.429 --> 04:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
provided does not specify or direct how
 
04:35:35.109 --> 04:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
much money should be allocated or given
 
04:35:35.839 --> 04:35:35.849 align:start position:0%
to the pilot program

04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
it is noted that

04:35:43.670 --> 04:35:43.680 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
04:35:57.750 --> 04:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
in rural and underserved communities
 
04:35:59.429 --> 04:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
across new hampshire there's a void of
 
04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar resources available in
 
04:36:03.029 --> 04:36:03.039 align:start position:0%
many new hampshire communities while
 
04:36:04.551 --> 04:36:04.561 align:start position:0%
telehealth medicine is incredibly
 
04:36:06.551 --> 04:36:06.561 align:start position:0%
helpful and an integral resource to
 
04:36:08.869 --> 04:36:08.879 align:start position:0%
folks in our communities it's true that
 
04:36:10.310 --> 04:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
many in underserved areas have
 
04:36:12.150 --> 04:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
telecommunications and broadband access
 
04:36:13.510 --> 04:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
issues right now
 
04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
and i think some of you had mentioned
 
04:36:19.349 --> 04:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:23.029 --> 04:36:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:25.029 --> 04:36:25.039 align:start position:0%
throughout my district
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
that they are seeking care for
 
04:36:27.990 --> 04:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
themselves or a child so you can utilize
 
04:36:29.910 --> 04:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
both in-person therapies and telehealth
 
04:36:32.310 --> 04:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
medicine and both avenues of care are
 
04:36:34.390 --> 04:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
heavy with lengthy wait times in
 
04:36:36.629 --> 04:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
scheduling or a lack of participation
 
04:36:36.639 --> 04:36:38.150 align:start position:0%
scheduling or a lack of participation

04:36:39.750 --> 04:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
through interstate health compacts or
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
other issues listed as a barrier to the
 
04:36:44.551 --> 04:36:44.561 align:start position:0%
constituents receiving and seeking care
 
04:36:46.390 --> 04:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
many have also shared with me that if
 
04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
there were an increased availability to
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
peer support centers like this
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
with um mentioned within the bill that a
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
reduction in stigma
 
04:36:55.349 --> 04:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
and a supported sense of community both
 
04:36:56.949 --> 04:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
for youth and adults
 
04:36:58.551 --> 04:36:58.561 align:start position:0%
would be bolstered as folks navigate
 
04:37:00.629 --> 04:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
their mental health wellness journey
 
04:37:02.230 --> 04:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
i thank the committee for their time and
 
04:37:04.470 --> 04:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
urge the community to pass 1537 in
 
04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
establishing a pilot mental health
 
04:37:07.429 --> 04:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
drop-in center program and i thank you
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
and would be happy to take questions
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
yes representative leon
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:37:20.070 --> 04:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative for being here and taking
 
04:37:20.080 --> 04:37:21.109 align:start position:0%
representative for being here and taking
questions

04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:37:23.750 --> 04:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
um looking at this as a peer-focused
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
recovery model i'm just curious why this
 
04:37:27.510 --> 04:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
is something that needs to be done
 
04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
through the state when it's a peer-based
 
04:37:31.590 --> 04:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
program and if that might be the sort of
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
thing that's uh better served through
 
04:37:34.709 --> 04:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
04:37:37.109 --> 04:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
other other voluntary groups that's a
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
great question thank you for asking that
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:37:42.869 --> 04:37:42.879 align:start position:0%
we have seen a myriad of other states
 
04:37:44.789 --> 04:37:44.799 align:start position:0%
implementing this as just one other tool
 
04:37:47.269 --> 04:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
in the toolbox for folks to connect with
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
other folks
 
04:37:51.510 --> 04:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
as a first step sort of an introduction
 
04:37:53.590 --> 04:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
for folks to go if they needed a place
 
04:37:56.470 --> 04:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
to identify needs or care services we do
 
04:37:59.750 --> 04:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:01.269 --> 04:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
like representative klein knight had
 
04:38:03.269 --> 04:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are some resources that
 
04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
already do exist that's true
 
04:38:08.230 --> 04:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
but what what we are asking for is a
 
04:38:11.109 --> 04:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
pilot program that
 
04:38:13.510 --> 04:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
is innovative in the way that um is
 
04:38:15.750 --> 04:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
approaching this need in a way that is a
 
04:38:15.760 --> 04:38:16.629 align:start position:0%
approaching this need in a way that is a
state

04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:38:18.470 --> 04:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
approach to the issue
 
04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
so that we are implementing this
 
04:38:22.869 --> 04:38:22.879 align:start position:0%
potentially if it if it is a successful
 
04:38:27.750 --> 04:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:31.429 --> 04:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
04:38:35.830 --> 04:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:38:37.750 --> 04:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
for taking the question this is just a
 
04:38:39.670 --> 04:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
quick question which is that i've heard
 
04:38:39.680 --> 04:38:40.869 align:start position:0%
quick question which is that i've heard
um

04:38:40.869 --> 04:38:40.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:43.189 --> 04:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
both of the people who testify talk a
 
04:38:45.510 --> 04:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
lot about children and adolescents
 
04:38:47.590 --> 04:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
but i don't see that that's referenced
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
in this bill so is this
 
04:38:50.949 --> 04:38:50.959 align:start position:0%
is this
 
04:38:52.789 --> 04:38:52.799 align:start position:0%
pilot program
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
intended to be for children and adults
 
04:38:57.670 --> 04:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question yes it
 
04:38:59.590 --> 04:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
would be and i think that this would be
 
04:39:01.590 --> 04:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
an integral resource for both parents
 
04:39:03.029 --> 04:39:03.039 align:start position:0%
and adults individually if they're
 
04:39:05.189 --> 04:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
seeking mental health wellness resources
 
04:39:07.750 --> 04:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
as well as if a child alongside of their
 
04:39:09.429 --> 04:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
parent is attending
 
04:39:11.189 --> 04:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
one of these drop-in centers to to
 
04:39:12.869 --> 04:39:12.879 align:start position:0%
receive some care or a
 
04:39:15.029 --> 04:39:15.039 align:start position:0%
conversation around that such as some of
 
04:39:17.269 --> 04:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
the other um programs that i think
 
04:39:19.429 --> 04:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
representative gay had mentioned as well
 
04:39:20.789 --> 04:39:20.799 align:start position:0%
as like
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
we know that they exist some of those
 
04:39:25.269 --> 04:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
other programs like alcoholics a or
 
04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
narcotics anonymous or any of those
 
04:39:29.029 --> 04:39:29.039 align:start position:0%
other types of resources this would be
 
04:39:30.789 --> 04:39:30.799 align:start position:0%
an integrated approach to mental health
 
04:39:33.510 --> 04:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
wellness and helping to address
 
04:39:35.670 --> 04:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
stigma in an interconnected issue i know
 
04:39:35.680 --> 04:39:36.869 align:start position:0%
stigma in an interconnected issue i know
that

04:39:36.869 --> 04:39:36.879 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:36.879 --> 04:39:38.310 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:39:38.310 --> 04:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:40.868 --> 04:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
when i attended the symposium
 
04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
that children and their parents were
 
04:39:43.590 --> 04:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
sharing that they were desperately
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
seeking this type
 
04:39:47.190 --> 04:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
of service
 
04:39:51.110 --> 04:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:53.430 --> 04:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative

carbon i'm the director for the bureau
 
04:40:16.230 --> 04:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
of mental health services i believe i
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
met you a few weeks ago at our dhhs meet
 
04:40:21.350 --> 04:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
and greet so pleasure to be here again
 
04:40:22.788 --> 04:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to provide some
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
information and simply say that we're
 
04:40:26.390 --> 04:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
here for the committee if you have
 
04:40:28.070 --> 04:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
our current state of mental health
 
04:40:31.270 --> 04:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
services and the resources and the
 
04:40:33.510 --> 04:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
challenges that our system is facing
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
i think we are thrilled to see
 
04:40:38.708 --> 04:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
a bill like this be put forward
 
04:40:41.830 --> 04:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
in acknowledgment and recognition of the
 
04:40:43.510 --> 04:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
very important role that peer support
 
04:40:45.270 --> 04:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
services play in our system of care and
 
04:40:47.670 --> 04:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
just the unique type of services
 
04:40:49.910 --> 04:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
that they offer
 
04:40:51.190 --> 04:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
i have brought and i'll leave some
 
04:40:53.190 --> 04:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
handouts for you
 
04:40:55.270 --> 04:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
regarding our current peer support
 
04:40:58.868 --> 04:40:58.878 align:start position:0%
agency network so we have eight agencies
 
04:41:00.868 --> 04:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
that are located in all 10 community
 
04:41:02.708 --> 04:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
mental health center regions around the
 
04:41:02.718 --> 04:41:03.670 align:start position:0%
mental health center regions around the
state

04:41:03.670 --> 04:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:41:05.590 --> 04:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
they are our network of peer support
 
04:41:09.030 --> 04:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
agencies they offer walk-in drop-in
 
04:41:09.040 --> 04:41:10.310 align:start position:0%
agencies they offer walk-in drop-in
services

04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:41:12.230 --> 04:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
and they provide peer support services
 
04:41:14.708 --> 04:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
on both an individual one-on-one level
 
04:41:16.948 --> 04:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
as well as group services
 
04:41:19.270 --> 04:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
their doors are open approximately 44
 
04:41:21.430 --> 04:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
hours per week
 
04:41:23.110 --> 04:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
it is a provision of our community
 
04:41:25.190 --> 04:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
mental health settlement agreement so
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
that's why we have this extensive
 
04:41:29.670 --> 04:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
network available statewide
 
04:41:32.230 --> 04:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
some of those peer support agencies also
 
04:41:32.240 --> 04:41:35.030 align:start position:0%
some of those peer support agencies also
offer

04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:37.030 --> 04:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
recovery oriented step up step down
 
04:41:39.830 --> 04:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
services which are a residential program
 
04:41:42.070 --> 04:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
as well as peer respite
 
04:41:43.510 --> 04:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
so again i'll leave
 
04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
just a basic handout about those
 
04:41:45.280 --> 04:41:47.590 align:start position:0%
just a basic handout about those
programs

04:41:47.590 --> 04:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:41:49.030 --> 04:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
as you've heard and this committee is
 
04:41:50.788 --> 04:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
very knowledgeable about all of the work
 
04:41:52.310 --> 04:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's happened in connection to the
 
04:41:54.868 --> 04:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
10-year mental health plan
 
04:41:57.990 --> 04:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
and so you may be familiar with the
 
04:41:59.910 --> 04:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
i know you're you've talked about this
 
04:42:01.270 --> 04:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
04:42:01.280 --> 04:42:02.150 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
the

04:42:02.150 --> 04:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:42:03.830 --> 04:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
crisis redesign that we've been
 
04:42:05.030 --> 04:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
embarking on
 
04:42:07.110 --> 04:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
and so just as a reminder that system
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
does include
 
04:42:11.030 --> 04:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
24 7 phone
 
04:42:13.590 --> 04:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
text and chat services
 
04:42:15.670 --> 04:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
where people can get connected to both
 
04:42:18.550 --> 04:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
mental health clinicians and peers via
 
04:42:21.030 --> 04:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
that modality
 
04:42:24.230 --> 04:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
um the mobile crisis response piece that
 
04:42:26.948 --> 04:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
is available statewide
 
04:42:30.070 --> 04:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
is also as you heard a combination of a
 
04:42:33.190 --> 04:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
clinician and a peer who would deploy
 
04:42:35.190 --> 04:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
and the next phase of that model which
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
really is a
 
04:42:38.550 --> 04:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
national and it's called crisis now and
 
04:42:40.628 --> 04:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
it's a best practice model for crisis
 
04:42:42.310 --> 04:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
services and it includes that third
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
component of a place to go a
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
location-based service where people can
 
04:42:47.750 --> 04:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
walk in
 
04:42:49.110 --> 04:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
24 7
 
04:42:50.628 --> 04:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
for a variety of support you know it can
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
be a law enforcement drop-off
 
04:42:52.718 --> 04:42:54.550 align:start position:0%
be a law enforcement drop-off
unit

04:42:54.550 --> 04:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
unit
 
04:42:57.190 --> 04:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire in about 2018 we
 
04:42:59.670 --> 04:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
did launch a pilot program
 
04:43:02.150 --> 04:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
here in concord called the behavioral
 
04:43:04.390 --> 04:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
health crisis treatment center
 
04:43:05.750 --> 04:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
and that model
 
04:43:07.830 --> 04:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
was designed
 
04:43:09.830 --> 04:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
to be one of those
 
04:43:11.910 --> 04:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
drop-in locations
 
04:43:13.430 --> 04:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
they were never actually as
 
04:43:15.910 --> 04:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative snow indicated staffing
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
has been a significant challenge
 
04:43:19.590 --> 04:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
especially for the overnight shifts and
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
they actually never got to the point of
 
04:43:22.948 --> 04:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
being able to staff their
 
04:43:25.670 --> 04:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
center 24 7.
 
04:43:27.830 --> 04:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
and so as we look forward and as you've
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
heard so much money has come into the
 
04:43:33.030 --> 04:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
state as a for mental health regarding
 
04:43:36.150 --> 04:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
um as a result of the arpa funding
 
04:43:38.070 --> 04:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
one of the pieces that we are starting
 
04:43:40.550 --> 04:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
to explore and we'll be looking
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
to better understand is what model will
 
04:43:43.910 --> 04:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
work here in new hampshire
 
04:43:45.990 --> 04:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
that model wasn't very successful
 
04:43:47.670 --> 04:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
there's a huge need i mean you're all
 
04:43:51.190 --> 04:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
aware of of the access challenges
 
04:43:53.270 --> 04:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
and so that's a priority of ours at the
 
04:43:54.708 --> 04:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
department as well working with our
 
04:43:56.788 --> 04:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
partners to better understand you know
 
04:43:59.190 --> 04:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
what will be viable accessible
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
our current network of peer support
 
04:44:03.030 --> 04:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
agencies is only available to adults so
 
04:44:06.070 --> 04:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:08.708 --> 04:44:08.718 align:start position:0%
limitation of the programs currently but
 
04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
that's strictly because that's how the
 
04:44:12.948 --> 04:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
funding has been designed
 
04:44:15.670 --> 04:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
so again my colleagues and i are here as
 
04:44:17.350 --> 04:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
a resource to provide information and
 
04:44:19.430 --> 04:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
support if if that would be of help to
 
04:44:20.708 --> 04:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:44:22.628 --> 04:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:44:28.310 --> 04:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:29.830 --> 04:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you for
 
04:44:32.948 --> 04:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:35.670 --> 04:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
is there any data out there
 
04:44:37.110 --> 04:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
that looks at other models that have
 
04:44:38.628 --> 04:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
done some other states that we could
 
04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to reinvent the wheel
 
04:44:41.670 --> 04:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
type of wheel that's already been
 
04:44:43.270 --> 04:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
invented and utilized that we could
 
04:44:45.430 --> 04:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
adapt here
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
yes that's an excellent question and we
 
04:44:50.868 --> 04:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
so we are part of a national network
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
of state mental health program directors
 
04:44:56.070 --> 04:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
and through that association
 
04:44:57.990 --> 04:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
they've done a lot of research on what
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
type of models have been most effective
 
04:45:02.070 --> 04:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
so there are some great models around
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
the country that we're looking to and
 
04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
they're often a combination of that you
 
04:45:08.788 --> 04:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
know as indicate that pure living room
 
04:45:10.788 --> 04:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
model so just kind of comfy chairs where
 
04:45:12.230 --> 04:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
people come in and talk with peers to
 
04:45:14.310 --> 04:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
have their initial crisis resolved
 
04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
all the way up to something that's
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
slightly more clinical so
 
04:45:21.990 --> 04:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
04:45:23.590 --> 04:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:45:23.600 --> 04:45:24.390 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
and

04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:26.788 --> 04:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:45:26.798 --> 04:45:27.830 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

04:45:27.830 --> 04:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:30.708 --> 04:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes i'm a little dense so
 
04:45:32.708 --> 04:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
are you supporting this bill or not
 
04:45:35.190 --> 04:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill
 
04:45:37.590 --> 04:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
you know it's hard to know i mean i'm
 
04:45:39.990 --> 04:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
simply here to provide information
 
04:45:41.590 --> 04:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of the
 
04:45:43.750 --> 04:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
types of resources that are framed out
 
04:45:46.070 --> 04:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the bill are in place today so i i
 
04:45:47.190 --> 04:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
even heard that as part of this
 
04:45:47.200 --> 04:45:48.310 align:start position:0%
even heard that as part of this
discussion

04:45:48.310 --> 04:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:45:51.190 --> 04:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:51.200 --> 04:45:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
up

04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:45:55.590 --> 04:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh i'm sorry to cut you off but um no i
 
04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
got it wrong
 
04:45:57.990 --> 04:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
04:45:58.000 --> 04:45:59.510 align:start position:0%
go ahead
um

04:45:59.510 --> 04:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:01.270 --> 04:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
what do you think has
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
in your opinion what do you think has
 
04:46:05.910 --> 04:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
worked and what hasn't worked in the in
 
04:46:08.310 --> 04:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
the pilot programs that you've
 
04:46:14.628 --> 04:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:18.150 --> 04:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
you know it's so and we as you hear we
 
04:46:19.430 --> 04:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
are in a really
 
04:46:22.310 --> 04:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
different place today than we were
 
04:46:24.628 --> 04:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
two years ago and so i i think as we
 
04:46:26.788 --> 04:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
look forward maybe what worked two years
 
04:46:26.798 --> 04:46:27.590 align:start position:0%
look forward maybe what worked two years
ago

04:46:27.590 --> 04:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
won't work as we move forward there have
 
04:46:32.150 --> 04:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
been a lot of suggestions around
 
04:46:34.150 --> 04:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
looking at alternative methods of
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
connecting via telehealth and
 
04:46:36.240 --> 04:46:37.270 align:start position:0%
connecting via telehealth and
um

04:46:37.270 --> 04:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:37.280 --> 04:46:38.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:46:38.230 --> 04:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:39.750 --> 04:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
what we have found
 
04:46:41.110 --> 04:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
when we've seen programs that have been
 
04:46:43.030 --> 04:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
really successful it's been a result of
 
04:46:45.190 --> 04:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
the community collaborations where we've
 
04:46:46.868 --> 04:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
had the agencies really working together
 
04:46:49.110 --> 04:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
we have peer support agencies partnering
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
with our community mental health centers
 
04:46:53.110 --> 04:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
to provide integrated care so that's
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
really where we've seen some synergy and
 
04:46:56.628 --> 04:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
some momentum
 
04:46:58.310 --> 04:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
in some of the pilot programs we've been
 
04:46:58.320 --> 04:47:01.270 align:start position:0%
in some of the pilot programs we've been
doing

04:47:01.270 --> 04:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:04.230 --> 04:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative shapiro
 
04:47:06.150 --> 04:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair
 
04:47:07.750 --> 04:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking this
 
04:47:10.470 --> 04:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
question um
 
04:47:12.310 --> 04:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
you reference the fact that there are
 
04:47:15.190 --> 04:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
already peer support um programs that
 
04:47:17.670 --> 04:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
cover the whole state
 
04:47:19.990 --> 04:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
only eight of them in the ten
 
04:47:21.670 --> 04:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
districts but somehow they cover the
 
04:47:24.230 --> 04:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
whole state and i know there are family
 
04:47:25.990 --> 04:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
resource centers
 
04:47:28.310 --> 04:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
that are
 
04:47:29.910 --> 04:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
would not strictly be considered a
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
mental health service
 
04:47:34.150 --> 04:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
but they do
 
04:47:37.350 --> 04:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
work with families and children um i
 
04:47:39.990 --> 04:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
think of all ages um probably mostly
 
04:47:42.070 --> 04:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
with younger children
 
04:47:45.190 --> 04:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if there's been any
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
examples of collaboration between
 
04:47:49.990 --> 04:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
mental health center
 
04:47:52.070 --> 04:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
peer support groups and these family
 
04:47:54.550 --> 04:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
resource centers
 
04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
that would
 
04:47:56.160 --> 04:47:57.990 align:start position:0%
that would
um

04:47:57.990 --> 04:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:00.470 --> 04:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
be somewhat similar to what this bill is
 
04:48:00.480 --> 04:48:01.430 align:start position:0%
be somewhat similar to what this bill is
um

04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:01.440 --> 04:48:04.390 align:start position:0%
um
describing

04:48:04.390 --> 04:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:05.910 --> 04:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's i don't know the answer to that
 
04:48:07.750 --> 04:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
question you know again our peer support
 
04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
agencies because of the way they were
 
04:48:13.350 --> 04:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
they came about they focus on adults so
 
04:48:14.708 --> 04:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
those connections may be happening
 
04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
locally but i'm not aware of it
 
04:48:20.230 --> 04:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative netarapam
 
04:48:21.190 --> 04:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:48:23.350 --> 04:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
um would you have any idea of the
 
04:48:25.750 --> 04:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
statistics of the number of people that
 
04:48:28.230 --> 04:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
would call
 
04:48:31.270 --> 04:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
a hotline resource who end up in the
 
04:48:34.390 --> 04:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
emergency room anyway i mean is that the
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
advice sometimes that the hotline would
 
04:48:37.040 --> 04:48:40.310 align:start position:0%
advice sometimes that the hotline would
give

04:48:40.310 --> 04:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:42.470 --> 04:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
that that's a tough question i mean the
 
04:48:43.670 --> 04:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
hope is
 
04:48:43.680 --> 04:48:44.470 align:start position:0%
hope is
that

04:48:44.470 --> 04:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:46.230 --> 04:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
the majority of people do not end up at
 
04:48:47.670 --> 04:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
the emergency room you know the
 
04:48:50.070 --> 04:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
intention is that we have this lifeline
 
04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
that people can call text chat into
 
04:48:55.750 --> 04:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
and about 80 of those those contacts
 
04:48:57.670 --> 04:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
will be resolved over the phone with no
 
04:48:57.680 --> 04:48:58.708 align:start position:0%
will be resolved over the phone with no
needed

04:48:58.708 --> 04:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
needed
 
04:49:00.868 --> 04:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
you know deployment no needed hospital
 
04:49:00.878 --> 04:49:01.750 align:start position:0%
you know deployment no needed hospital
stay

04:49:01.750 --> 04:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
stay
 
04:49:03.430 --> 04:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
so the hope is that we're resolving and
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
helping to keep people happy and healthy
 
04:49:06.470 --> 04:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
in their communities
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
04:49:14.470 --> 04:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you just as
 
04:49:16.470 --> 04:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
a quick observation would you say that
 
04:49:16.480 --> 04:49:17.430 align:start position:0%
a quick observation would you say that
the

04:49:17.430 --> 04:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:49:20.310 --> 04:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
mobile community crisis support teams
 
04:49:25.910 --> 04:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:27.990 --> 04:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
see how bad i am at technology i can't
 
04:49:29.110 --> 04:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
even talk
 
04:49:31.990 --> 04:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
about it
 
04:49:37.590 --> 04:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
because i've heard reports that these
 
04:49:41.030 --> 04:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis
 
04:49:43.670 --> 04:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
response teams have really headed people
 
04:49:46.150 --> 04:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
off of landing in the emergency room
 
04:49:47.990 --> 04:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
would you say that you've gotten data
 
04:49:49.670 --> 04:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
back to indicate that those have been
 
04:49:52.150 --> 04:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
reasonably successful in many cases of
 
04:49:53.510 --> 04:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
shutting off that
 
04:49:55.270 --> 04:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
that stop
 
04:49:57.110 --> 04:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so i mean as you're aware we've had
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
three mobile crisis response teams
 
04:50:00.628 --> 04:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
operating around the state for a number
 
04:50:03.510 --> 04:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
of years now and those teams
 
04:50:05.750 --> 04:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
we do see data we publish it quarterly
 
04:50:07.750 --> 04:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
as a requirement under our community
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
mental health settlement agreement so
 
04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see that data
 
04:50:13.110 --> 04:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
and they have been successful in helping
 
04:50:15.990 --> 04:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
to divert people and so our hope is now
 
04:50:17.030 --> 04:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
04:50:18.788 --> 04:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
a system statewide we have data
 
04:50:20.310 --> 04:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
requirements statewide that we'll be
 
04:50:24.070 --> 04:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
able to analyze some of that information
 
04:50:26.150 --> 04:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
statewide follow-up and you are
 
04:50:28.310 --> 04:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
expanding those teams at least in i know
 
04:50:30.470 --> 04:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
in manchester it also now responds to
 
04:50:32.550 --> 04:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
children but you're expanding those to
 
04:50:34.708 --> 04:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
include children all across the state is
 
04:50:37.190 --> 04:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
that are you hoped to
 
04:50:38.948 --> 04:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
that is the requirement is that they are
 
04:50:40.868 --> 04:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
providing integrated
 
04:50:42.550 --> 04:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
crisis response services to people
 
04:50:44.948 --> 04:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
across the age continuum
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:51.110 --> 04:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:53.110 --> 04:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
a specific question to you relative to
 
04:50:54.070 --> 04:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:50:56.788 --> 04:50:56.798 align:start position:0%
uh on line five six and seven are those
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
services being met now with the programs
 
04:51:01.670 --> 04:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
we i should say that you've described
 
04:51:01.680 --> 04:51:04.708 align:start position:0%
we i should say that you've described
today

04:51:04.708 --> 04:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
um they are currently being provided by
 
04:51:08.708 --> 04:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
our peer support agencies during that
 
04:51:10.628 --> 04:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
kind of business hour
 
04:51:12.628 --> 04:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
04:51:14.948 --> 04:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
they are required to provide
 
04:51:17.190 --> 04:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
voluntary short-term services to help
 
04:51:19.030 --> 04:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
people on their wellness and recovery
 
04:51:21.510 --> 04:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
through our peer support agencies yes
 
04:51:23.270 --> 04:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
and follow up follow up thank you mr
 
04:51:25.270 --> 04:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
chairman then relative to representative
 
04:51:27.830 --> 04:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
klein knight's goal in this bill is it
 
04:51:32.310 --> 04:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i think what was referenced is
 
04:51:35.350 --> 04:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
that it's really hard for people to even
 
04:51:37.110 --> 04:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
know what resources are available in the
 
04:51:39.350 --> 04:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
community people aren't you know the
 
04:51:41.990 --> 04:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
utilization numbers are very low we the
 
04:51:43.990 --> 04:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
state do fund these programs and our
 
04:51:46.150 --> 04:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
funding is minimal it ranges from about
 
04:51:50.708 --> 04:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
150 000 a year to 450 000 a year
 
04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
per agency
 
04:51:54.390 --> 04:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
and so you know they have limited
 
04:51:54.400 --> 04:51:55.510 align:start position:0%
and so you know they have limited
ability

04:51:55.510 --> 04:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
ability
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
of the numbers that they can reach
 
04:52:01.110 --> 04:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
one more time one more and then specific
 
04:52:03.750 --> 04:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
to the bill where the goal is to
 
04:52:06.470 --> 04:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
identify increased access
 
04:52:09.030 --> 04:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
do we already have the access and do we
 
04:52:11.270 --> 04:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
need to advertise it more
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely a strategy that we're
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
looking at is better
 
04:52:16.868 --> 04:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
information and public awareness around
 
04:52:18.390 --> 04:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
how to access care
 
04:52:20.070 --> 04:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
and with your successful achievement of
 
04:52:21.830 --> 04:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
that goal as just described do we need
 
04:52:25.110 --> 04:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:26.550 --> 04:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i'm in the position to
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
answer that i think you know do we need
 
04:52:32.230 --> 04:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
to build out our network of um walk-in
 
04:52:34.230 --> 04:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
and peer support services i would say
 
04:52:36.830 --> 04:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
yes that's a system that that needs
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
04:52:48.390 --> 04:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:52:48.400 --> 04:52:49.590 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

04:52:49.590 --> 04:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:51.350 --> 04:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
was there any disruption to the
 
04:52:53.110 --> 04:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
availability of these peer support
 
04:52:55.430 --> 04:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
services being open in the last two
 
04:52:58.628 --> 04:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
years with the pandemic
 
04:53:00.788 --> 04:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
yes and so we we have some information
 
04:53:02.470 --> 04:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
about that as well that we publish
 
04:53:02.480 --> 04:53:03.590 align:start position:0%
about that as well that we publish
quarterly

04:53:03.590 --> 04:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
quarterly
 
04:53:05.910 --> 04:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
so i could get you that information
 
04:53:07.750 --> 04:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
although i must say that our peer
 
04:53:09.510 --> 04:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
support agencies were remarkable in
 
04:53:11.670 --> 04:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
their ability to pivot
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
to provide remote services they were
 
04:53:15.430 --> 04:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
doing personal phone calls to people
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
engaging in a different way and opened
 
04:53:18.868 --> 04:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
their doors quite quickly
 
04:53:21.430 --> 04:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
so there was limited interruption
 
04:53:23.030 --> 04:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and one follow-up one
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up oh just quickly um so are they
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
all open again and operating
 
04:53:32.948 --> 04:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
um with their normal hours and walk-in
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
i hesitate because of staffing you know
 
04:53:38.788 --> 04:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
it's an ever-changing day or week so
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
when they have the staff available
 
04:53:43.350 --> 04:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:45.990 --> 04:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you miss carbon
 
04:53:49.510 --> 04:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
different ones had suggested changing
 
04:53:51.750 --> 04:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
this or that
 
04:53:53.990 --> 04:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
is there sentiment
 
04:53:54.000 --> 04:53:54.948 align:start position:0%
is there sentiment
for

04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
a group to
 
04:53:59.110 --> 04:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
tweak this with an amendment
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
and would you chair it
 
04:54:05.350 --> 04:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you uh representative mckay and
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%

represent manchester hillsborough
 
04:55:30.070 --> 04:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
district 11.
 
04:55:33.670 --> 04:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
there this is a bill that
 
04:55:35.430 --> 04:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
was worked on by a lot of different
 
04:55:35.440 --> 04:55:36.708 align:start position:0%
was worked on by a lot of different
people

04:55:36.708 --> 04:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:55:40.708 --> 04:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
trying to again creatively solve what is
 
04:55:45.110 --> 04:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
in fact a glaring crisis
 
04:55:48.550 --> 04:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of us know and what we just heard
 
04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
reiterated that we have an extensive
 
04:55:54.390 --> 04:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
04:55:56.708 --> 04:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
providers in the state
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:00.240 --> 04:56:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
what

04:56:01.750 --> 04:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
happened the last two years proved
 
04:56:07.590 --> 04:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of things
 
04:56:10.070 --> 04:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
and if those that are studying
 
04:56:12.948 --> 04:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
um telehealth communications
 
04:56:12.958 --> 04:56:13.750 align:start position:0%
um telehealth communications
they

04:56:13.750 --> 04:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:56:15.990 --> 04:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
know a couple of things about this one
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
that telehealth was all of a sudden
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
funded very well
 
04:56:22.390 --> 04:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
for everyone
 
04:56:25.510 --> 04:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
that were being quarantined or
 
04:56:27.670 --> 04:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
not leaving their houses
 
04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
and number two
 
04:56:31.510 --> 04:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
how many people
 
04:56:33.990 --> 04:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
started to use those services because
 
04:56:35.350 --> 04:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
they had never
 
04:56:37.590 --> 04:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
had that option before
 
04:56:39.830 --> 04:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
so there was a couple of things that we
 
04:56:41.910 --> 04:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
noticed we noticed
 
04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
just how many people expressed interest
 
04:56:48.150 --> 04:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
in therapeutic services
 
04:56:48.160 --> 04:56:49.590 align:start position:0%
in therapeutic services
and

04:56:49.590 --> 04:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:52.150 --> 04:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
and the need for therapeutic services
 
04:56:54.470 --> 04:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
that they had never gotten until this
 
04:56:56.470 --> 04:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
moment and how it was made available to
 
04:56:58.708 --> 04:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
them so i'd like to point that out
 
04:56:58.718 --> 04:56:59.910 align:start position:0%
them so i'd like to point that out
because

04:56:59.910 --> 04:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:57:02.948 --> 04:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
that um that number is actu is very very
 
04:57:04.708 --> 04:57:04.718 align:start position:0%
large and scary
 
04:57:04.718 --> 04:57:06.390 align:start position:0%
large and scary
so

04:57:06.390 --> 04:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:08.390 --> 04:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
we're moving forward we're getting
 
04:57:11.110 --> 04:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
healthier as a country we're going to be
 
04:57:13.430 --> 04:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
losing a lot of these services and the
 
04:57:15.910 --> 04:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
funding that they provide because we're
 
04:57:17.270 --> 04:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
not going to be in crisis we're not
 
04:57:19.510 --> 04:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
going to be an emergency anymore
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
but again the numbers don't lie the
 
04:57:24.150 --> 04:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
number of people that took advantage of
 
04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
these health care services and the
 
04:57:28.948 --> 04:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
number of people that also said they had
 
04:57:31.510 --> 04:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
never been able to get these services
 
04:57:34.390 --> 04:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
until they were offered just recently in
 
04:57:36.150 --> 04:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
the last two years has been quite
 
04:57:38.868 --> 04:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
apparent and we cannot all of a sudden
 
04:57:41.670 --> 04:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
offer these services to people and then
 
04:57:44.070 --> 04:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
drop them off
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
so with that being said
 
04:57:49.110 --> 04:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
the whole country was
 
04:57:51.270 --> 04:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
giving services
 
04:57:53.590 --> 04:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
to all different states
 
04:57:56.948 --> 04:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
um if you couldn't get a
 
04:57:58.470 --> 04:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
therapist in
 
04:58:00.310 --> 04:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
one state it didn't matter because you
 
04:58:01.750 --> 04:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
were meeting them
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
online and you were meeting them
 
04:58:03.360 --> 04:58:06.788 align:start position:0%
online and you were meeting them
remotely

04:58:06.788 --> 04:58:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:08.150 --> 04:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
it was
 
04:58:08.160 --> 04:58:09.670 align:start position:0%
it was
explicitly

04:58:09.670 --> 04:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
explicitly
 
04:58:12.788 --> 04:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
of great value to our state because of
 
04:58:14.948 --> 04:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
the lack of providers
 
04:58:17.510 --> 04:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
so with that being said with people now
 
04:58:19.670 --> 04:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
getting the help that they need from
 
04:58:21.430 --> 04:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
these providers that are all over the
 
04:58:24.310 --> 04:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
country we suddenly find ourselves in a
 
04:58:24.320 --> 04:58:25.350 align:start position:0%
country we suddenly find ourselves in a
position

04:58:25.350 --> 04:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
position
 
04:58:25.360 --> 04:58:26.310 align:start position:0%
position
where

04:58:26.310 --> 04:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:58:29.190 --> 04:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
thousands upon thousands
 
04:58:32.708 --> 04:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
of our residents are about to lose
 
04:58:34.868 --> 04:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
their therapists that they have been
 
04:58:39.190 --> 04:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
seeing for two years online
 
04:58:40.628 --> 04:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
how do we
 
04:58:43.590 --> 04:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
mitigate that especially since
 
04:58:45.670 --> 04:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
if they drop they get dropped by their
 
04:58:45.680 --> 04:58:47.110 align:start position:0%
if they drop they get dropped by their
therapists

04:58:47.110 --> 04:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
therapists
 
04:58:48.868 --> 04:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
and we don't have enough therapists here
 
04:58:51.030 --> 04:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
04:58:53.350 --> 04:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
are we going to be doing our people
 
04:58:55.350 --> 04:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
knowingly ending
 
04:58:57.990 --> 04:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
their and disrupting their services are
 
04:58:59.510 --> 04:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
we setting
 
04:59:01.910 --> 04:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
them up for failure are we going to put
 
04:59:04.150 --> 04:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
more of a burden on our hospital and er
 
04:59:05.990 --> 04:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
situation and are we going to add to
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
that double-digit number that we see
 
04:59:10.150 --> 04:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
every week for people waiting for
 
04:59:13.670 --> 04:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
services in the emergency room
 
04:59:15.750 --> 04:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
so i challenge you this bill may not be
 
04:59:18.150 --> 04:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
perfect again
 
04:59:21.750 --> 04:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
but you guys are the experts here
 
04:59:26.628 --> 04:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:26.638 --> 04:59:27.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:59:27.670 --> 04:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:29.990 --> 04:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
but this is a problem that's not going
 
04:59:31.430 --> 04:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
to go away and we're not going to be
 
04:59:33.190 --> 04:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
able to sweep it out of the rug and when
 
04:59:36.390 --> 04:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
we end the health care coverage that all
 
04:59:38.628 --> 04:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
these people are getting treated for at
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
the end of this very month
 
04:59:43.910 --> 04:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
on our website it states that
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
people will not be able to continue
 
04:59:47.830 --> 04:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
seeking out of state providers on
 
04:59:50.628 --> 04:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
january 31st
 
04:59:53.350 --> 04:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
what is that number going to look like
 
04:59:55.510 --> 04:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
in our institutions what is that number
 
04:59:57.510 --> 04:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
going to look like in our emergency
 
05:00:00.230 --> 05:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
rooms and how is
 
05:00:00.240 --> 05:00:01.910 align:start position:0%
rooms and how is
that

05:00:01.910 --> 05:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:00:03.910 --> 05:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
lack of funding that we just heard from
 
05:00:07.750 --> 05:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
dhhs going to keep up with the ability
 
05:00:07.760 --> 05:00:09.030 align:start position:0%
dhhs going to keep up with the ability
to

05:00:09.030 --> 05:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:00:12.788 --> 05:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
um treat these people now before i'm old
 
05:00:14.550 --> 05:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
i'm almost done
 
05:00:16.788 --> 05:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
i swear
 
05:00:18.868 --> 05:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
there is a compromise right
 
05:00:22.070 --> 05:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
it says if you look at it
 
05:00:24.628 --> 05:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
not more than five prov not more than
 
05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
five people a provider out of state is
 
05:00:29.030 --> 05:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
is um
 
05:00:31.270 --> 05:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
giving therapy to
 
05:00:33.190 --> 05:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
should be required to pay for our
 
05:00:33.200 --> 05:00:35.030 align:start position:0%
should be required to pay for our
licensing

05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
05:00:36.868 --> 05:00:36.878 align:start position:0%
the idea behind that
 
05:00:37.910 --> 05:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
this was waived during this pandemic
 
05:00:42.230 --> 05:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
they hadn't been paying the licensing
 
05:00:42.240 --> 05:00:43.110 align:start position:0%
they hadn't been paying the licensing
fees

05:00:43.110 --> 05:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
fees
 
05:00:44.708 --> 05:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
and they're already helping all these
 
05:00:44.718 --> 05:00:46.070 align:start position:0%
and they're already helping all these
people

05:00:46.070 --> 05:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:00:48.470 --> 05:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
and the other idea behind that is
 
05:00:51.670 --> 05:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
if a provider out of state
 
05:00:54.628 --> 05:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
isn't seeing an entire workload to to
 
05:00:57.910 --> 05:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
add to their income and they're in fact
 
05:01:00.390 --> 05:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
doing us a service
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
our state of service from another state
 
05:01:05.190 --> 05:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
would it be fair
 
05:01:09.030 --> 05:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
to then make them pay a licensing fee
 
05:01:10.708 --> 05:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
for one or two people that they're
 
05:01:12.708 --> 05:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
helping in our state
 
05:01:14.310 --> 05:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
i leave that up to you
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
to decide
 
05:01:19.590 --> 05:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
but this is again a creative way to try
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
and keep our people
 
05:01:23.350 --> 05:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
getting the help that they are getting
 
05:01:26.070 --> 05:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
right now and continue to get the care
 
05:01:28.470 --> 05:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
so that we don't see
 
05:01:31.030 --> 05:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
an ever increasing amount of emergency
 
05:01:34.628 --> 05:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
room visits and people and and again um
 
05:01:37.750 --> 05:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
i hate to say it but um a skyrocketing
 
05:01:41.190 --> 05:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:43.270 --> 05:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
and um with that i'll take questions
 
05:01:48.230 --> 05:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:49.990 --> 05:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and again thank you
 
05:01:52.150 --> 05:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:01:55.948 --> 05:01:55.958 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking back to a bill we had
 
05:01:57.910 --> 05:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
pre-covered covid
 
05:02:00.788 --> 05:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
that dealt comprehensively with
 
05:02:05.910 --> 05:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:07.830 --> 05:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
to keep
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
not only to
 
05:02:11.910 --> 05:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
increase access but also to ensure that
 
05:02:14.470 --> 05:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
somebody who is temporarily out of the
 
05:02:16.070 --> 05:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
state can keep
 
05:02:18.550 --> 05:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
on in therapy with
 
05:02:20.230 --> 05:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
an established
 
05:02:20.240 --> 05:02:21.510 align:start position:0%
an established
therapist

05:02:21.510 --> 05:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
05:02:24.628 --> 05:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
but my question is that was only for
 
05:02:27.190 --> 05:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
psychologists which is a very small
 
05:02:31.030 --> 05:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
portion of our mental health
 
05:02:31.040 --> 05:02:32.310 align:start position:0%
portion of our mental health
workers

05:02:32.310 --> 05:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
workers
 
05:02:34.868 --> 05:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
and i guess my question for you is uh
 
05:02:38.230 --> 05:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
how are we at the moment monitoring the
 
05:02:40.470 --> 05:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
quality of care
 
05:02:42.070 --> 05:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
that is being
 
05:02:42.080 --> 05:02:44.310 align:start position:0%
that is being
administered

05:02:44.310 --> 05:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
administered
 
05:02:46.628 --> 05:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
under this program
 
05:02:48.948 --> 05:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
i completely understand your question
 
05:02:51.750 --> 05:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative weber
 
05:02:53.830 --> 05:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
again this is only pertaining to talk
 
05:02:53.840 --> 05:02:55.030 align:start position:0%
again this is only pertaining to talk
therapy

05:02:55.030 --> 05:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
05:02:57.670 --> 05:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
and i do believe that the talk therapy
 
05:03:00.948 --> 05:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
licensing is very very similar
 
05:03:04.390 --> 05:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
throughout all 50 states and i'm also
 
05:03:07.750 --> 05:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that if somebody was not
 
05:03:10.390 --> 05:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
being able to be treated in the state
 
05:03:12.470 --> 05:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
before having the ability to talk to
 
05:03:14.470 --> 05:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
somebody is better than having no
 
05:03:15.910 --> 05:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
therapy at all
 
05:03:19.510 --> 05:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm also sure that i hope and i do
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
hope sincerely that
 
05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
they also would have the ability to see
 
05:03:26.550 --> 05:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
a different person as well
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:35.430 --> 05:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:37.910 --> 05:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing as i was trying to work my
 
05:03:40.628 --> 05:03:40.638 align:start position:0%
way down to see if this
 
05:03:42.310 --> 05:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
had really been answered
 
05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
uh but am i correct in thinking this
 
05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
only require only applies to physicians
 
05:03:50.310 --> 05:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
because it says this paragraph shall not
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
oh it doesn't apply to physicians so
 
05:03:55.670 --> 05:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
how do we know that the people who are
 
05:03:57.670 --> 05:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
providing the services are appropriately
 
05:03:59.430 --> 05:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
licensed in the place where they are
 
05:04:01.910 --> 05:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
providing it is my other question thank
 
05:04:03.750 --> 05:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
you so much for your question and there
 
05:04:05.910 --> 05:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
may be an amendment that's needed to
 
05:04:07.590 --> 05:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
clarify that they are licensed in their
 
05:04:10.470 --> 05:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
own state and that would be a very uh i
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
would be grateful for that
 
05:04:15.190 --> 05:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
to solidify the any misunderstanding and
 
05:04:17.750 --> 05:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
to know that they are actually qualified
 
05:04:17.760 --> 05:04:18.628 align:start position:0%
to know that they are actually qualified
to

05:04:18.628 --> 05:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:04:22.948 --> 05:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:29.590 --> 05:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:29.600 --> 05:04:30.830 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:04:30.830 --> 05:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:04:33.510 --> 05:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
sorry can i ask on paragraph four if you
 
05:04:34.948 --> 05:04:34.958 align:start position:0%
would answer
 
05:04:36.550 --> 05:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
it says here that
 
05:04:38.788 --> 05:04:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh out-of-state mental health providers
 
05:04:40.868 --> 05:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
who provide telehealth treatment to
 
05:04:43.350 --> 05:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
fewer than five patients per year
 
05:04:44.948 --> 05:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
okay i'm assuming
 
05:04:47.190 --> 05:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
those are the people who are
 
05:04:49.190 --> 05:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
licensed in their own state but not
 
05:04:51.110 --> 05:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
licensed here in new hampshire
 
05:04:53.430 --> 05:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
and the sentence at the top of paragraph
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
four which says
 
05:04:57.510 --> 05:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the provisions of law to
 
05:04:59.670 --> 05:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
the contrary and out of state healthcare
 
05:05:01.750 --> 05:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
provided providing services by means of
 
05:05:03.990 --> 05:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
telemedicine for telehealth shall be
 
05:05:06.550 --> 05:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
required to be licensed certified and or
 
05:05:09.430 --> 05:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
registered with the appropriate
 
05:05:11.350 --> 05:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
licensing board within the division of
 
05:05:13.590 --> 05:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
health professions i'm assuming that
 
05:05:13.600 --> 05:05:14.390 align:start position:0%
health professions i'm assuming that
means

05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
means
 
05:05:16.470 --> 05:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
that if you're an out-of-state provider
 
05:05:19.590 --> 05:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
and you you get a new hampshire license
 
05:05:21.590 --> 05:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
you can then provide all these services
 
05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
and if you don't get a license but have
 
05:05:25.430 --> 05:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
a license in your own state you can
 
05:05:27.910 --> 05:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
provide services up to five people is
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
that a correct interpretation of that
 
05:05:31.750 --> 05:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm having i i didn't quite
 
05:05:34.470 --> 05:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
hear your the last part of your your
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
question close enough
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
05:05:41.510 --> 05:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'll get close thank you
 
05:05:44.550 --> 05:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
what it says here is that uh the the
 
05:05:46.708 --> 05:05:46.718 align:start position:0%
opening of power of section four says
 
05:05:46.718 --> 05:05:48.230 align:start position:0%
opening of power of section four says
notwithstanding

05:05:48.230 --> 05:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding
 
05:05:50.390 --> 05:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
any provision of law to the contrary out
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
of state healthcare
 
05:05:53.670 --> 05:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
provide a healthcare professional
 
05:05:55.750 --> 05:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
providing services by means of
 
05:05:57.910 --> 05:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
telemedicine to tell health shall be
 
05:06:00.390 --> 05:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
required to be licensed certified or
 
05:06:02.070 --> 05:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
registered by the appropriate
 
05:06:03.910 --> 05:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
relationship board within the division
 
05:06:06.868 --> 05:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
of health professions i'm assuming that
 
05:06:09.750 --> 05:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
sentence applies to one of the boards of
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
licensing that are
 
05:06:12.550 --> 05:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire so they'd be
 
05:06:14.788 --> 05:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
required to get a license here in new
 
05:06:17.430 --> 05:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire then the exception comes that
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
if you're an out-of-state provider who's
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
licensed in their own state but not here
 
05:06:23.910 --> 05:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
you can then provide treatment services
 
05:06:26.470 --> 05:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
to up to five patients per year without
 
05:06:27.750 --> 05:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
having to apply for new hampshire
 
05:06:29.910 --> 05:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
license am i interpreting that section
 
05:06:29.920 --> 05:06:31.510 align:start position:0%
license am i interpreting that section
correctly

05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
05:06:34.230 --> 05:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
i believe so the idea is to
 
05:06:36.070 --> 05:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
allow people to
 
05:06:38.708 --> 05:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
help our state out of state providers to
 
05:06:40.868 --> 05:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
help our state alleviate the shortage
 
05:06:42.310 --> 05:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
05:06:45.670 --> 05:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
and if they're actually having more than
 
05:06:48.788 --> 05:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
five and i'm i'm not sure if it says it
 
05:06:50.948 --> 05:06:50.958 align:start position:0%
in here but again maybe you can include
 
05:06:52.550 --> 05:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
this in the amendment that
 
05:06:57.030 --> 05:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:57.040 --> 05:06:58.470 align:start position:0%
 
every

05:06:58.470 --> 05:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
every
 
05:07:00.868 --> 05:07:00.878 align:start position:0%
year that the licensing would be coming
 
05:07:03.430 --> 05:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
up to approach to renew anyways and
 
05:07:05.590 --> 05:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
they'd have to report how many
 
05:07:07.430 --> 05:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
clients that they're seeing
 
05:07:09.830 --> 05:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
and again to keep this fair for our
 
05:07:12.070 --> 05:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
state um
 
05:07:13.750 --> 05:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know people should be paying
 
05:07:16.310 --> 05:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
licensing fees so that
 
05:07:17.910 --> 05:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
that isn't
 
05:07:17.920 --> 05:07:18.868 align:start position:0%
that isn't
what

05:07:18.868 --> 05:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
we're saying that we want all people to
 
05:07:22.070 --> 05:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
get out of licensing fees we're hope
 
05:07:23.670 --> 05:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that and
 
05:07:25.910 --> 05:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
again um you
 
05:07:25.920 --> 05:07:27.270 align:start position:0%
again um you
have

05:07:27.270 --> 05:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:07:29.510 --> 05:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to change that number i
 
05:07:32.830 --> 05:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
leave it up to the discretion of this
 
05:07:34.550 --> 05:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
body just
 
05:07:34.560 --> 05:07:35.510 align:start position:0%
body just
one

05:07:35.510 --> 05:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:07:38.788 --> 05:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up okay
 
05:07:40.390 --> 05:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
in addition to the division of public
 
05:07:42.550 --> 05:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
health there is a another body that
 
05:07:42.560 --> 05:07:43.910 align:start position:0%
health there is a another body that
licenses

05:07:43.910 --> 05:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
05:07:45.750 --> 05:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
all of the health all the mental health
 
05:07:47.990 --> 05:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
professions social workers clinical
 
05:07:50.390 --> 05:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
mental health counselors etc the only
 
05:07:51.910 --> 05:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
ones that are an exception to that they
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
have their own board with psychologists
 
05:07:57.190 --> 05:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
but those two boards need somehow to be
 
05:07:59.270 --> 05:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
integrated into it and they would be the
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
ones that would decide who is registered
 
05:08:03.910 --> 05:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
and who is not registered in this state
 
05:08:05.590 --> 05:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
do we need to tie that in or do you
 
05:08:07.510 --> 05:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
think this paragraph makes that clear
 
05:08:07.520 --> 05:08:09.190 align:start position:0%
think this paragraph makes that clear
enough

05:08:09.190 --> 05:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
enough
 
05:08:11.110 --> 05:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question
 
05:08:14.230 --> 05:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
um i i'm not sure if it isn't clear i
 
05:08:18.708 --> 05:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:18.718 --> 05:08:20.708 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:08:20.708 --> 05:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:08:23.270 --> 05:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um just a question
 
05:08:24.948 --> 05:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
05:08:24.958 --> 05:08:26.070 align:start position:0%
looking at
lines

05:08:26.070 --> 05:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
lines
 
05:08:27.990 --> 05:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
five six and seven it talks about an
 
05:08:29.750 --> 05:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
annual needs based analysis to be done
 
05:08:31.270 --> 05:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
by the department
 
05:08:34.470 --> 05:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
and then also in um
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
lines 19-21 the oplc who does an annual
 
05:08:39.990 --> 05:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
audit of out-of-state medical mental
 
05:08:41.830 --> 05:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
health providers have you checked with
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
those departments about the financial
 
05:08:45.910 --> 05:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
impact and whether a fiscal note would
 
05:08:48.628 --> 05:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
be needed for this
 
05:08:50.390 --> 05:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
i've checked with
 
05:08:53.270 --> 05:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
the licensing department only on the
 
05:08:55.670 --> 05:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
basis of
 
05:08:58.230 --> 05:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
what it provides to allow people to
 
05:08:58.240 --> 05:08:59.750 align:start position:0%
what it provides to allow people to
conduct

05:08:59.750 --> 05:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
05:09:03.350 --> 05:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
telehealth medicine and talk therapy
 
05:09:03.360 --> 05:09:04.390 align:start position:0%
telehealth medicine and talk therapy
i

05:09:04.390 --> 05:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:09:05.990 --> 05:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
did not
 
05:09:06.000 --> 05:09:06.948 align:start position:0%
did not
and

05:09:06.948 --> 05:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:09:09.750 --> 05:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
have not asked about the fiscal note
 
05:09:12.150 --> 05:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
providing that
 
05:09:14.070 --> 05:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
and this again might need an amendment
 
05:09:14.080 --> 05:09:15.590 align:start position:0%
and this again might need an amendment
where

05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:09:17.590 --> 05:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that the
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
providers are forthcoming and just like
 
05:09:22.390 --> 05:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
any other provider applies for a license
 
05:09:25.510 --> 05:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
at that time they then tell this
 
05:09:27.510 --> 05:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
department how many new hampshire
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
residents they're seeing
 
05:09:31.750 --> 05:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i hope that it would work similar to
 
05:09:34.390 --> 05:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
what is happening right now during the
 
05:09:34.400 --> 05:09:36.150 align:start position:0%
what is happening right now during the
crisis

05:09:36.150 --> 05:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
05:09:37.910 --> 05:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
05:09:40.150 --> 05:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
assume that whatever's been happening
 
05:09:41.830 --> 05:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
right now has been working and i'd like
 
05:09:44.788 --> 05:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
to keep continuing
 
05:09:46.628 --> 05:09:46.638 align:start position:0%
what's been working
 
05:09:46.638 --> 05:09:47.910 align:start position:0%
what's been working
also

05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:09:50.310 --> 05:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if this is a red flag
 
05:09:50.320 --> 05:09:51.670 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if this is a red flag
but

05:09:51.670 --> 05:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:09:53.270 --> 05:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
we probably need more people working in
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
the licensing department because i've
 
05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of providers can't even get
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:05.350 --> 05:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:07.430 --> 05:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
i just had another question based on the
 
05:10:09.190 --> 05:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
fact that you have used the
 
05:10:12.868 --> 05:10:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh phrase talk therapy a number of times
 
05:10:15.350 --> 05:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
 
05:10:17.430 --> 05:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
is there something in the bill that i've
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
missed that limits it to that or are
 
05:10:22.550 --> 05:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
we are we talking about people who can
 
05:10:25.750 --> 05:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
prescribe medication um
 
05:10:25.760 --> 05:10:26.470 align:start position:0%
prescribe medication um
is

05:10:26.470 --> 05:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
are you intending to limit it to one
 
05:10:29.990 --> 05:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
thing or are you intending it to be
 
05:10:33.030 --> 05:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
broader is what i'm asking i'm intending
 
05:10:36.310 --> 05:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
it to limit to just talk therapy so this
 
05:10:39.350 --> 05:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
isn't abused by other providers in
 
05:10:42.390 --> 05:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
medicine and because there are other
 
05:10:45.190 --> 05:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements for other scopes
 
05:10:47.430 --> 05:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
and more in-depth invasive procedures in
 
05:10:51.270 --> 05:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
medicine so i'm trying to alleviate um
 
05:10:53.030 --> 05:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
the need for
 
05:10:54.948 --> 05:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
what we have in the state which is a
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
lack of therapy providers
 
05:11:00.788 --> 05:11:00.798 align:start position:0%
and is that specified in the bill at
 
05:11:01.990 --> 05:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
this point
 
05:11:04.230 --> 05:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
i tried to specify it and again if it's
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
um not
 
05:11:07.510 --> 05:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
specified and
 
05:11:09.750 --> 05:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
and now knowing my intent i would hope
 
05:11:12.310 --> 05:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
that you could maybe
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
put this also in that group that you're
 
05:11:16.708 --> 05:11:16.718 align:start position:0%
gonna be having
 
05:11:19.740 --> 05:11:19.750 align:start position:0%
that would be really really awesome
 
05:11:19.750 --> 05:11:21.670 align:start position:0%
that would be really really awesome

representative king
 
05:11:26.310 --> 05:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:11:28.550 --> 05:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
which i will admit that this might be a
 
05:11:33.270 --> 05:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
bit of a stretch because i'm
 
05:11:35.590 --> 05:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
kind of putting words into
 
05:11:38.948 --> 05:11:38.958 align:start position:0%
what i'm sensing from our discussion but
 
05:11:41.350 --> 05:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
the word i want to use is rest
 
05:11:41.360 --> 05:11:43.350 align:start position:0%
the word i want to use is rest
reciprocity

05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
reciprocity
 
05:11:43.360 --> 05:11:44.868 align:start position:0%
reciprocity
and

05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:11:47.590 --> 05:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
i i actually met somebody
 
05:11:50.550 --> 05:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
in october who had just moved to the
 
05:11:52.948 --> 05:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
amherst milford area
 
05:11:54.708 --> 05:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
and she couldn't practice in new
 
05:11:54.718 --> 05:11:55.910 align:start position:0%
and she couldn't practice in new
hampshire

05:11:55.910 --> 05:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:11:57.830 --> 05:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
because she was not certified and could
 
05:11:58.830 --> 05:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
had to go through the whole
 
05:12:01.110 --> 05:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
certification and she was moving from
 
05:12:03.270 --> 05:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
massachusetts which i'm sure everybody
 
05:12:04.628 --> 05:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
in this room would say that they're
 
05:12:06.310 --> 05:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit more regulated
 
05:12:08.230 --> 05:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
than we are and probably tougher
 
05:12:09.590 --> 05:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
standards even
 
05:12:12.788 --> 05:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
so um my question is is could
 
05:12:14.550 --> 05:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
reciprocity be
 
05:12:17.830 --> 05:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
incorporated in this bill
 
05:12:21.430 --> 05:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely um i hope that
 
05:12:23.670 --> 05:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
we make things easier for people to help
 
05:12:26.150 --> 05:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
people and not harder
 
05:12:29.430 --> 05:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i also hope that um
 
05:12:30.868 --> 05:12:30.878 align:start position:0%
not only
 
05:12:32.868 --> 05:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
people can continue seeing
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
people that they've developed a
 
05:12:36.868 --> 05:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
relationship with over the last couple
 
05:12:39.910 --> 05:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
of years that they don't have to
 
05:12:43.270 --> 05:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
stop and find not only what is
 
05:12:45.830 --> 05:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i'm not sure if i'm not sure if
 
05:12:47.030 --> 05:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
you have had calls from your
 
05:12:47.040 --> 05:12:48.550 align:start position:0%
you have had calls from your
constituents

05:12:48.550 --> 05:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
05:12:51.030 --> 05:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
but i have in regards to
 
05:12:53.670 --> 05:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
i can't even get a therapist even if i
 
05:12:56.310 --> 05:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
wanted one or there's a wait list this
 
05:12:57.590 --> 05:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
long or
 
05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
i had a therapist and they just moved
 
05:13:02.310 --> 05:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
and now i have to find another one or
 
05:13:04.868 --> 05:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
i'm going to lose my therapist at the
 
05:13:06.150 --> 05:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
end of this month because they don't
 
05:13:09.350 --> 05:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
live in the state and then also on top
 
05:13:12.628 --> 05:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
of that to have to i have to then go
 
05:13:15.350 --> 05:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
once i do find one i have to
 
05:13:17.670 --> 05:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
start at the beginning of my trauma and
 
05:13:19.990 --> 05:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
i have to relive that experience and
 
05:13:21.590 --> 05:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
start from ground one and then if i
 
05:13:23.430 --> 05:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't like that therapist or we don't
 
05:13:25.510 --> 05:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
work well together i have to do it all
 
05:13:28.070 --> 05:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
over again and then i have to wait even
 
05:13:29.910 --> 05:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
more months to get the treatment that i
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
need or work on the here and now of what
 
05:13:35.350 --> 05:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
problems i'm having in life right now so
 
05:13:37.990 --> 05:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
as you can see the list starts to get
 
05:13:41.110 --> 05:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
longer of what we can and cannot help
 
05:13:43.270 --> 05:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
our people with
 
05:13:44.230 --> 05:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:13:46.708 --> 05:13:46.718 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
05:13:47.910 --> 05:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:13:49.590 --> 05:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
both of you
 
05:13:52.868 --> 05:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
i have really basic questions how much
 
05:13:55.510 --> 05:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
does a license cost
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's one
 
05:14:00.150 --> 05:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
i'm questioning the limit of five which
 
05:14:03.910 --> 05:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
brings up the whole issue of reciprocity
 
05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
accepting someone's certification
 
05:14:10.070 --> 05:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
licensure from another state because it
 
05:14:13.030 --> 05:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
seems like what our real goal is
 
05:14:15.270 --> 05:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
is to incorporate more
 
05:14:17.510 --> 05:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
therapists who
 
05:14:19.830 --> 05:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
should be in practice
 
05:14:19.840 --> 05:14:21.350 align:start position:0%
should be in practice
and

05:14:21.350 --> 05:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:14:23.910 --> 05:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
five seems really limited
 
05:14:26.708 --> 05:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
and the cost how expensive is this
 
05:14:29.990 --> 05:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
because is that a driving force
 
05:14:33.190 --> 05:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
on the limit of five
 
05:14:34.948 --> 05:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
yes and no
 
05:14:36.550 --> 05:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
05:14:38.470 --> 05:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
um our licensing
 
05:14:42.868 --> 05:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
fee for um therapists is um i believe
 
05:14:45.030 --> 05:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
not over three hundred dollars for
 
05:14:48.708 --> 05:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
annually for two years i believe
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
but um
 
05:14:50.638 --> 05:14:52.550 align:start position:0%
but um
i

05:14:52.550 --> 05:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
i know some of you may know just how
 
05:14:55.680 --> 05:14:56.708 align:start position:0%
i know some of you may know just how
low

05:14:56.708 --> 05:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
low
 
05:15:00.550 --> 05:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
income a a social worker or a therapist
 
05:15:01.670 --> 05:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
might be
 
05:15:03.750 --> 05:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
and that they don't go into this
 
05:15:05.510 --> 05:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
profession to
 
05:15:09.110 --> 05:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
make an exceedingly amount of money and
 
05:15:09.120 --> 05:15:10.150 align:start position:0%
make an exceedingly amount of money and
they

05:15:10.150 --> 05:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
might struggle with that and that
 
05:15:12.480 --> 05:15:13.350 align:start position:0%
might struggle with that and that
to

05:15:13.350 --> 05:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:15:17.590 --> 05:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
pay a fee before helping um
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
one or two you know just what if if they
 
05:15:21.910 --> 05:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:15:24.470 --> 05:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
see one person from new hampshire
 
05:15:24.480 --> 05:15:25.510 align:start position:0%
see one person from new hampshire
um

05:15:25.510 --> 05:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:26.868 --> 05:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
they're not going to do it why would
 
05:15:28.708 --> 05:15:28.718 align:start position:0%
they do it and especially in a time
 
05:15:31.990 --> 05:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
where we need it so this
 
05:15:33.670 --> 05:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
is trying to
 
05:15:35.030 --> 05:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
make it
 
05:15:35.040 --> 05:15:36.788 align:start position:0%
make it
look

05:15:36.788 --> 05:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
look
 
05:15:39.910 --> 05:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
viable or helpful to people that might
 
05:15:41.750 --> 05:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
have a little
 
05:15:47.510 --> 05:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:50.150 --> 05:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative snow thank you mr
 
05:15:51.830 --> 05:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
chairman i do remember
 
05:15:53.590 --> 05:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago maybe it was
 
05:15:54.868 --> 05:15:54.878 align:start position:0%
longer than that
 
05:15:57.430 --> 05:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
we had a specific bill about reciprocity
 
05:15:59.190 --> 05:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
that we considered
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
and that was a very
 
05:16:03.670 --> 05:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
complicated bill to deal with i know the
 
05:16:06.070 --> 05:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
board of licensure got very involved
 
05:16:08.708 --> 05:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
with us and they had some concerns about
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
giving it as pure reciprocity because we
 
05:16:13.270 --> 05:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
don't always understand
 
05:16:15.510 --> 05:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
did the standards that existed in
 
05:16:16.948 --> 05:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
another state
 
05:16:16.958 --> 05:16:17.830 align:start position:0%
another state
really

05:16:17.830 --> 05:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:16:19.670 --> 05:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
measure up to our standards which i
 
05:16:21.670 --> 05:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
think are pretty strong here in new
 
05:16:21.680 --> 05:16:22.628 align:start position:0%
think are pretty strong here in new
hampshire

05:16:22.628 --> 05:16:22.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:16:23.990 --> 05:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
but in any case
 
05:16:26.390 --> 05:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
they finally did something where they
 
05:16:26.400 --> 05:16:28.070 align:start position:0%
they finally did something where they
expedited

05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
expedited
 
05:16:29.430 --> 05:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:16:31.190 --> 05:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
that if you were licensed in another
 
05:16:31.200 --> 05:16:32.310 align:start position:0%
that if you were licensed in another
state

05:16:32.310 --> 05:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:16:34.230 --> 05:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
you could
 
05:16:36.628 --> 05:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
kind of abbreviate the process it took
 
05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
to get your license transferred
 
05:16:40.470 --> 05:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
and opened here in new hampshire without
 
05:16:42.628 --> 05:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
having you through all the steps that
 
05:16:44.470 --> 05:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
somebody applying for the first time
 
05:16:46.150 --> 05:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
does this ring a bell with anybody else
 
05:16:48.230 --> 05:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
that was on this committee at that time
 
05:16:50.390 --> 05:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i do think that there are steps
 
05:16:52.868 --> 05:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
that were already taken to expedite
 
05:16:54.708 --> 05:16:54.718 align:start position:0%
somebody that was like your
 
05:16:56.310 --> 05:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
neighbor who was licensed in
 
05:16:57.990 --> 05:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts which does have good
 
05:16:58.000 --> 05:16:59.190 align:start position:0%
massachusetts which does have good
standards

05:16:59.190 --> 05:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
standards
 
05:17:01.350 --> 05:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
that i think the the board relationship
 
05:17:02.550 --> 05:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
and they'll already have to be the ones
 
05:17:04.470 --> 05:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
to answer that they've taken steps to
 
05:17:05.750 --> 05:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
make sure they don't have to go through
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
all the
 
05:17:08.708 --> 05:17:08.718 align:start position:0%
and there were a lot of steps you take
 
05:17:10.150 --> 05:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
when you're applying for the first time
 
05:17:12.390 --> 05:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
but i think it was expedited so that
 
05:17:14.390 --> 05:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
ought to be explored and
 
05:17:15.910 --> 05:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you think that ought to be
 
05:17:19.030 --> 05:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
explored yes yes
 
05:17:19.040 --> 05:17:20.150 align:start position:0%
explored yes yes
um

05:17:20.150 --> 05:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:22.390 --> 05:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
if i may respond i of course i think
 
05:17:25.270 --> 05:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
that ought to be explored and of course
 
05:17:26.550 --> 05:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
um i
 
05:17:28.708 --> 05:17:28.718 align:start position:0%
think there might need to be changes
 
05:17:31.750 --> 05:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
here and of course we only had a week to
 
05:17:34.070 --> 05:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
kind of get our ideas into the office as
 
05:17:35.910 --> 05:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know that being said that's not a
 
05:17:38.390 --> 05:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
great excuse as a
 
05:17:41.510 --> 05:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
lawmaker but again this isn't my area of
 
05:17:45.190 --> 05:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
expertise i i did the best i could i'm
 
05:17:46.868 --> 05:17:46.878 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with a really creative
 
05:17:49.590 --> 05:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
solution to assist our people in
 
05:17:51.590 --> 05:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
continuum of care
 
05:17:54.628 --> 05:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
i myself am about to lose my therapist
 
05:17:56.470 --> 05:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
at the end of this month
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
so and i for one
 
05:17:58.798 --> 05:17:59.750 align:start position:0%
so and i for one
don't

05:17:59.750 --> 05:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:18:02.868 --> 05:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
know what to do along with all my people
 
05:18:04.470 --> 05:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
and if there's a waiting list and
 
05:18:06.550 --> 05:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
there's not enough therapists
 
05:18:08.550 --> 05:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry to the licensing
 
05:18:11.590 --> 05:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
department i really am
 
05:18:13.510 --> 05:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
but again i was trying to come up with a
 
05:18:15.830 --> 05:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
fair number and if it's working right
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
now during a pandemic
 
05:18:23.830 --> 05:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
05:18:25.200 --> 05:18:27.110 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
representative

05:18:27.110 --> 05:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:18:30.948 --> 05:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
seeing none the chair recognizes mr john
 
05:18:33.670 --> 05:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
hinck or dr john hinck from the new
 
05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:51.190 --> 05:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
yeah hi i'm dr john hank i'm currently
 
05:18:52.948 --> 05:18:52.958 align:start position:0%
serving as the president
 
05:18:55.750 --> 05:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire psychiatric society
 
05:18:57.670 --> 05:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
which is a district branch of the
 
05:19:00.788 --> 05:19:00.798 align:start position:0%
american psychiatric association
 
05:19:02.868 --> 05:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire psychiatric society
 
05:19:07.350 --> 05:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
and i support the house bill 1405
 
05:19:09.910 --> 05:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
so i have a couple of
 
05:19:09.920 --> 05:19:11.430 align:start position:0%
so i have a couple of
statements

05:19:11.430 --> 05:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
statements
 
05:19:13.270 --> 05:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
from the american psychiatric
 
05:19:17.030 --> 05:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
association regarding tele psychiatry
 
05:19:18.830 --> 05:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
the use of the video based
 
05:19:21.670 --> 05:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
telepsychiatry helps meet
 
05:19:24.550 --> 05:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
patient needs for convenient
 
05:19:27.190 --> 05:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
affordable and readily accessible mental

health services
 
05:19:33.150 --> 05:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
with a robust evidence base that shows
 
05:19:35.110 --> 05:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
telepsychiatry leading
 
05:19:37.270 --> 05:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
to improved outcomes
 
05:19:40.390 --> 05:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
and higher patient satisfaction
 
05:19:40.400 --> 05:19:41.990 align:start position:0%
and higher patient satisfaction
ratings

05:19:41.990 --> 05:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
ratings
 
05:19:45.110 --> 05:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
and they have a policy
 
05:19:49.190 --> 05:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
that telemedicine and psychiatry using
 
05:19:51.430 --> 05:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
video conferencing is a validated and
 
05:19:54.230 --> 05:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
effective practice of medicine
 
05:19:57.030 --> 05:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
that increases access to cure
 
05:19:58.230 --> 05:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
which we definitely need in new
 
05:19:58.240 --> 05:20:00.230 align:start position:0%
which we definitely need in new
hampshire

05:20:00.230 --> 05:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:20:02.470 --> 05:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
the american psychiatric association
 
05:20:05.110 --> 05:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
supports the use of telemedicine
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
as a legitimate component of a mental

delivery system
 
05:20:14.550 --> 05:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
and they have done a couple of surveys
 
05:20:17.670 --> 05:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
and that has shown the results have
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
shown improved access to cure
 
05:20:26.150 --> 05:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
reduced no-show rates and
 
05:20:30.548 --> 05:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
a high rate of patient satisfaction
 
05:20:32.788 --> 05:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
this underscores that psychiatrists
 
05:20:32.798 --> 05:20:34.230 align:start position:0%
this underscores that psychiatrists
continue

05:20:34.230 --> 05:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
continue
 
05:20:37.830 --> 05:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
to rely on telehealth for treating
 
05:20:42.150 --> 05:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
psychiatric and substance use disorders
 
05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
and that the regulatory changes made at
 
05:20:46.548 --> 05:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
05:20:48.708 --> 05:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
of the public health emergency to
 
05:20:51.590 --> 05:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
increase access to these services
 
05:20:53.910 --> 05:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
continue to be essential
 
05:20:59.190 --> 05:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:02.390 --> 05:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
the benefits of tele-psychiatry include
 
05:21:05.510 --> 05:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
that patients are more likely to keep
 
05:21:07.910 --> 05:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
their appointments and when patients can
 
05:21:10.150 --> 05:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
use telehealth to be seen
 
05:21:12.150 --> 05:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
while at home they are satisfied with
 
05:21:12.160 --> 05:21:13.910 align:start position:0%
while at home they are satisfied with
treatment

05:21:13.910 --> 05:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
05:21:15.510 --> 05:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
they are more likely to continue with
 
05:21:18.310 --> 05:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
their course of therapy
 
05:21:20.548 --> 05:21:20.558 align:start position:0%
research suggests that this results in
 
05:21:23.990 --> 05:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
better medication compliance
 
05:21:25.910 --> 05:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
fewer presentations to the emergency
 
05:21:25.920 --> 05:21:28.230 align:start position:0%
fewer presentations to the emergency
departments

05:21:28.230 --> 05:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
departments
 
05:21:30.948 --> 05:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
fewer patient admissions to an inpatient
 
05:21:30.958 --> 05:21:32.150 align:start position:0%
fewer patient admissions to an inpatient
unit

05:21:32.150 --> 05:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
unit
 
05:21:36.628 --> 05:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
and fewer subsequent readmissions
 
05:21:39.830 --> 05:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
this results in improved access
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
better outcomes overall
 
05:21:45.430 --> 05:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
decreased cost
 
05:21:47.750 --> 05:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
and preserves limited community
 
05:21:47.760 --> 05:21:49.270 align:start position:0%
and preserves limited community
resources

05:21:49.270 --> 05:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
resources
 
05:21:53.110 --> 05:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
for example too few psychiatric beds
 
05:21:56.150 --> 05:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
and what's happening currently
 
05:21:58.868 --> 05:21:58.878 align:start position:0%
in the survey what the survey showed is
 
05:21:58.878 --> 05:22:01.590 align:start position:0%
in the survey what the survey showed is
that

05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:03.990 --> 05:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:22:04.000 --> 05:22:05.990 align:start position:0%
the um
patients

05:22:05.990 --> 05:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
patients
 
05:22:08.948 --> 05:22:08.958 align:start position:0%
located so in other words currently what
 
05:22:10.390 --> 05:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to say here
 
05:22:11.830 --> 05:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
currently the psychiatrists being
 
05:22:14.390 --> 05:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
surveyed we're saying that they were
 
05:22:16.628 --> 05:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
most of them were actually treating
 
05:22:19.270 --> 05:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
patients from outside their state
 
05:22:22.390 --> 05:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
so that's what the apa
 
05:22:25.190 --> 05:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
survey results were showing
 
05:22:28.150 --> 05:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
and uh that the flexibilities around the
 
05:22:28.160 --> 05:22:29.510 align:start position:0%
and uh that the flexibilities around the
licensure

05:22:29.510 --> 05:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
05:22:31.270 --> 05:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
enacted because of the public health
 
05:22:31.280 --> 05:22:32.470 align:start position:0%
enacted because of the public health
emergency

05:22:32.470 --> 05:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
05:22:35.430 --> 05:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
has actually increased access to psychic
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
to psychiatrists
 
05:22:37.200 --> 05:22:39.190 align:start position:0%
to psychiatrists
nationwide

05:22:39.190 --> 05:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
nationwide
 
05:22:40.948 --> 05:22:40.958 align:start position:0%
so in closing
 
05:22:43.510 --> 05:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire psychiatric society
 
05:22:47.430 --> 05:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
supports the house bill 1405
 
05:22:49.350 --> 05:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
but i would recommend a couple of
 
05:22:52.548 --> 05:22:52.558 align:start position:0%
additions number one
 
05:22:55.350 --> 05:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
and this would be to strengthen the bill
 
05:22:57.510 --> 05:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
number one if
 
05:23:00.390 --> 05:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
out-of-state practitioners provide
 
05:23:00.400 --> 05:23:02.070 align:start position:0%
out-of-state practitioners provide
telehealth

05:23:02.070 --> 05:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
telehealth
 
05:23:04.708 --> 05:23:04.718 align:start position:0%
mental health services during a mental
 
05:23:06.788 --> 05:23:06.798 align:start position:0%
health emergency
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
they agree to be subject to the same
 
05:23:11.110 --> 05:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations of the new
 
05:23:11.120 --> 05:23:12.390 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations of the new
hampshire

05:23:12.390 --> 05:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:23:15.750 --> 05:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
licensing board in their specialty
 
05:23:19.270 --> 05:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
as if they are licensed in this state
 
05:23:21.670 --> 05:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
and then number two
 
05:23:23.830 --> 05:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
they must have adequate liability
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
coverage for the treatment being
 
05:23:26.400 --> 05:23:27.430 align:start position:0%
coverage for the treatment being
provided

05:23:27.430 --> 05:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
provided
 
05:23:28.548 --> 05:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:30.390 --> 05:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you dr hank would you take
 
05:23:30.400 --> 05:23:32.628 align:start position:0%
thank you dr hank would you take
questions

05:23:32.628 --> 05:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:23:34.310 --> 05:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh
 
05:23:36.470 --> 05:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative canark
 
05:23:37.750 --> 05:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you i think this is a rather
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
quick one in the beginning your
 
05:23:41.190 --> 05:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
testimony you commented about
 
05:23:43.510 --> 05:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
video telemedicine but our telemedicine
 
05:23:45.750 --> 05:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
statutes currently do include audio
 
05:23:47.510 --> 05:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
video and other electronic media are you
 
05:23:49.430 --> 05:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable that we include all of those
 
05:23:52.830 --> 05:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:56.150 --> 05:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
you representative shapiro
 
05:23:57.750 --> 05:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:23:59.510 --> 05:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
taking this question i think you
 
05:24:01.110 --> 05:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
partially answered the question that i
 
05:24:03.190 --> 05:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
was going to ask when you said you would
 
05:24:05.110 --> 05:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
suggest an amendment
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
that would that said that people who
 
05:24:10.150 --> 05:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
were practicing across state lines
 
05:24:12.548 --> 05:24:12.558 align:start position:0%
would be subject to the same rules and
 
05:24:12.558 --> 05:24:14.470 align:start position:0%
would be subject to the same rules and
regulations

05:24:14.470 --> 05:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
05:24:16.628 --> 05:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
as people who were practicing with an
 
05:24:20.070 --> 05:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
in-state license is that correct correct
 
05:24:20.080 --> 05:24:22.230 align:start position:0%
in-state license is that correct correct
so

05:24:22.230 --> 05:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:24:23.910 --> 05:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's good
 
05:24:23.920 --> 05:24:25.510 align:start position:0%
that's good
um

05:24:25.510 --> 05:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:27.920 --> 05:24:27.930 align:start position:0%
who would have jurisdiction over
 
05:24:27.930 --> 05:24:29.270 align:start position:0%
who would have jurisdiction over
[Music]

05:24:29.270 --> 05:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:24:33.190 --> 05:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:35.110 --> 05:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
following up on those rules and
 
05:24:37.670 --> 05:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
regulations so for example if somebody
 
05:24:39.590 --> 05:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
from new jersey was
 
05:24:41.270 --> 05:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
doing telehealth with someone in new
 
05:24:45.830 --> 05:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:47.750 --> 05:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
had a
 
05:24:49.350 --> 05:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
significant problem with something that
 
05:24:52.150 --> 05:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
that therapist was doing an ethics
 
05:24:55.270 --> 05:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
issue or something like that
 
05:24:57.430 --> 05:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
if if the person was licensed in new
 
05:24:59.910 --> 05:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire they would address that
 
05:25:02.390 --> 05:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
complaint to the
 
05:25:04.390 --> 05:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire board of mental health say
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
if it was a social worker um
 
05:25:10.230 --> 05:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
with this person now practicing across
 
05:25:11.590 --> 05:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
state lines
 
05:25:13.910 --> 05:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
who would have jurisdiction
 
05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
05:25:20.310 --> 05:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:22.070 --> 05:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about the answer to that
 
05:25:24.390 --> 05:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
question so sorry about that but i i
 
05:25:26.548 --> 05:25:26.558 align:start position:0%
believe a patient who would want to
 
05:25:26.558 --> 05:25:27.910 align:start position:0%
believe a patient who would want to
complain

05:25:27.910 --> 05:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
complain
 
05:25:29.910 --> 05:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
could have a choice of complaining to
 
05:25:31.190 --> 05:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
their own
 
05:25:34.708 --> 05:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
state medical board or complain to the
 
05:25:37.750 --> 05:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire medical board
 
05:25:40.628 --> 05:25:40.638 align:start position:0%

representative wood follow-up
 
05:26:17.110 --> 05:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up um
 
05:26:19.030 --> 05:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
would you believe that it's my
 
05:26:20.868 --> 05:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh
 
05:26:23.830 --> 05:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
the current status of telemedicine
 
05:26:25.910 --> 05:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in the area of the
 
05:26:28.310 --> 05:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
domicile of the patient
 
05:26:30.390 --> 05:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
that's where the legal
 
05:26:32.470 --> 05:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
matter would be handled if there was an
 
05:26:37.670 --> 05:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:39.990 --> 05:26:40.000 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:26:53.750 --> 05:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:26:55.670 --> 05:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
um i don't have
 
05:26:57.670 --> 05:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
totally the answer but one of the things
 
05:26:57.680 --> 05:26:58.628 align:start position:0%
totally the answer but one of the things
that

05:26:58.628 --> 05:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:27:00.470 --> 05:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
after being on the board of arms for 10
 
05:27:02.070 --> 05:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
years one of the things i think you're
 
05:27:03.750 --> 05:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
going down right wrote here as far as
 
05:27:04.948 --> 05:27:04.958 align:start position:0%
having the
 
05:27:08.708 --> 05:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
out-of-state provider consenting to
 
05:27:10.548 --> 05:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
being held accountable to the licensing
 
05:27:11.750 --> 05:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
board one of the things that could
 
05:27:13.430 --> 05:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
possibly that you thought of you know if
 
05:27:15.030 --> 05:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
you thought about this but
 
05:27:15.040 --> 05:27:15.910 align:start position:0%
you thought about this but
they're

05:27:15.910 --> 05:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:27:18.070 --> 05:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
consenting to the fact that if there's a
 
05:27:19.750 --> 05:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
complaint to the medical board of
 
05:27:21.190 --> 05:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
licensing boards we want to make a
 
05:27:25.190 --> 05:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
complaint to that they have somehow
 
05:27:27.190 --> 05:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
obtained from their respective licensing
 
05:27:29.430 --> 05:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
board in that state that they'll be seen
 
05:27:31.270 --> 05:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
and overseen by
 
05:27:32.948 --> 05:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
the board here in new hampshire through
 
05:27:34.788 --> 05:27:34.798 align:start position:0%
the board and say new jersey
 
05:27:36.070 --> 05:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's one of the things you could try to
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
build and draft the saying is that i
 
05:27:40.628 --> 05:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
incur that if the board of medicine in
 
05:27:42.070 --> 05:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:27:43.990 --> 05:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
has an issue from a patient complaint
 
05:27:46.868 --> 05:27:46.878 align:start position:0%
here but the providers in new jersey
 
05:27:48.868 --> 05:27:48.878 align:start position:0%
that they're providing the board of new
 
05:27:51.190 --> 05:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
jersey oversight to it because you get
 
05:27:52.868 --> 05:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
into a situation where
 
05:27:54.470 --> 05:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
one side is in new jersey but the other
 
05:27:56.470 --> 05:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
side is the patients in new hampshire so
 
05:27:57.990 --> 05:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
if you could find a way for the boards
 
05:27:59.510 --> 05:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
themselves to have some sort of
 
05:28:01.590 --> 05:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
reciprocity about discipline that may
 
05:28:03.190 --> 05:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
solve the problem
 
05:28:04.628 --> 05:28:04.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:28:06.868 --> 05:28:06.878 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
05:28:08.548 --> 05:28:08.558 align:start position:0%

um
what

05:28:12.548 --> 05:28:12.558 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:28:14.230 --> 05:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
happens if
 
05:28:17.670 --> 05:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
the psychiatrist wants to
 
05:28:20.310 --> 05:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
prescribe a certain medication and the
 
05:28:22.548 --> 05:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
patient lives in another state
 
05:28:25.590 --> 05:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
do we then have some problems with
 
05:28:29.670 --> 05:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy license i mean can no
 
05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:31.840 align:start position:0%

hampshire if i may mr chairman stated in
 
05:28:37.110 --> 05:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire as long as the
 
05:28:38.948 --> 05:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
provider who wrote the prescription is
 
05:28:40.948 --> 05:28:40.958 align:start position:0%
licensed in a respective state
 
05:28:42.708 --> 05:28:42.718 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire pharmacy will
 
05:28:44.230 --> 05:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
honor it
 
05:28:47.510 --> 05:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:50.948 --> 05:28:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:54.310 --> 05:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:57.670 --> 05:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
when i was in practice i was licensed in
 
05:28:59.990 --> 05:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
maine new hampshire
 
05:29:02.390 --> 05:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
and massachusetts
 
05:29:02.400 --> 05:29:03.190 align:start position:0%
and massachusetts
and

05:29:03.190 --> 05:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:04.310 --> 05:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:29:07.110 --> 05:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
had a condo in maine
 
05:29:09.990 --> 05:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
so i used to use that to see patients in
 
05:29:10.000 --> 05:29:11.510 align:start position:0%
so i used to use that to see patients in
may

05:29:11.510 --> 05:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
may
 
05:29:15.670 --> 05:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
until i discovered that maine taxes
 
05:29:17.190 --> 05:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
your entire
 
05:29:17.200 --> 05:29:18.230 align:start position:0%
your entire
income

05:29:18.230 --> 05:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
income
 
05:29:20.150 --> 05:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
in maine
 
05:29:21.190 --> 05:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
so that
 
05:29:24.390 --> 05:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
i suddenly stopped seeing those
 
05:29:27.190 --> 05:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
patients but it's complicated
 
05:29:27.200 --> 05:29:28.070 align:start position:0%
patients but it's complicated
but

05:29:28.070 --> 05:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:29:30.788 --> 05:29:30.798 align:start position:0%
the issue for telehealth
 
05:29:32.868 --> 05:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
which i've had an interest in for a long
 
05:29:32.878 --> 05:29:33.990 align:start position:0%
which i've had an interest in for a long
time

05:29:33.990 --> 05:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:29:36.948 --> 05:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
was was the way in which that they can
 
05:29:39.990 --> 05:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
provide services to the north country
 
05:29:43.110 --> 05:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
and particularly dartmouth hitchcock and
 
05:29:45.430 --> 05:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
that population
 
05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
in fact i was so excited i thought we
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
should get a grant you know to provide
 
05:29:51.830 --> 05:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
services to children
 
05:29:53.750 --> 05:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
only to find out that there had been a
 
05:29:56.788 --> 05:29:56.798 align:start position:0%
grant for the last three years before i
 
05:29:58.948 --> 05:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
checked in so that
 
05:30:01.830 --> 05:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
but that has been very successful
 
05:30:03.270 --> 05:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
but there are these
 
05:30:04.868 --> 05:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
issues about
 
05:30:07.670 --> 05:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
a person even being licensed in two
 
05:30:07.680 --> 05:30:08.868 align:start position:0%
a person even being licensed in two
states

05:30:08.868 --> 05:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:30:12.150 --> 05:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
that you may find it quite shocking
 
05:30:12.160 --> 05:30:13.590 align:start position:0%
that you may find it quite shocking
when

05:30:13.590 --> 05:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:30:16.070 --> 05:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
that happens doctor would you join in

05:30:22.150 --> 05:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
it's got to be a question
 
05:30:24.548 --> 05:30:24.558 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:30:26.548 --> 05:30:26.558 align:start position:0%

is it provides that it's going to amend
 
05:32:43.910 --> 05:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
rsa 310 a colon 1g by inserting a new
 
05:32:46.788 --> 05:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
paragraph after that the new paragraph
 
05:32:50.310 --> 05:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
is a roman 2 lowercase a
 
05:32:51.670 --> 05:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
in the same way that the department of
 
05:32:53.670 --> 05:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
health human services has its enabling
 
05:32:55.990 --> 05:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
legislation for the commissioner to do
 
05:32:58.470 --> 05:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
global responsibilities and
 
05:33:03.030 --> 05:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
duties we have ours under rsa 126 a and
 
05:33:06.150 --> 05:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's generally seen in a colon 5. so if
 
05:33:08.230 --> 05:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
you think about hhs and placement of
 
05:33:10.150 --> 05:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
where our rulemaking authority this will
 
05:33:11.350 --> 05:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
make some sense
 
05:33:13.190 --> 05:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
my following commentary
 
05:33:14.548 --> 05:33:14.558 align:start position:0%
that rsa
 
05:33:17.830 --> 05:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
310 dash a colon one is essentially the
 
05:33:19.110 --> 05:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
equivalent for the office of
 
05:33:20.470 --> 05:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
professional life insurance
 
05:33:22.788 --> 05:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
certification it essentially sets up the
 
05:33:25.750 --> 05:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
duties of the executive director as well
 
05:33:27.590 --> 05:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
as responsibilities and oversight of the
 
05:33:29.830 --> 05:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
licensure of certain occupations and
 
05:33:34.390 --> 05:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
professions under uh that particular
 
05:33:36.548 --> 05:33:36.558 align:start position:0%
chapter and also under that title
 
05:33:38.390 --> 05:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
because there's a enormous i should say
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
enormous but believe me attorney
 
05:33:43.510 --> 05:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
courtney does an amazing job with a lot
 
05:33:45.190 --> 05:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
of boards and agencies that fall under
 
05:33:47.750 --> 05:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
her umbrella so our first observation in
 
05:33:50.310 --> 05:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
terms of placement is that this new
 
05:33:52.310 --> 05:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph that would require
 
05:33:54.548 --> 05:33:54.558 align:start position:0%
the department to make an assessment
 
05:33:56.788 --> 05:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
over the number of actual providers
 
05:33:59.030 --> 05:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
within the state to declare a mental
 
05:34:00.788 --> 05:34:00.798 align:start position:0%
health emergency
 
05:34:03.110 --> 05:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
so again the placement of this is within
 
05:34:05.110 --> 05:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure and
 
05:34:07.830 --> 05:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
certification not dhhs and as much as we
 
05:34:10.390 --> 05:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
do not want to push our wonderful other
 
05:34:13.190 --> 05:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
agency under an economic bus that
 
05:34:16.390 --> 05:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
currently is over the department uh we
 
05:34:18.230 --> 05:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
just want to make that that note we also
 
05:34:19.990 --> 05:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
don't license the professionals that are
 
05:34:23.430 --> 05:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
enumerated in that section it does fall
 
05:34:24.948 --> 05:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
within the office of professional
 
05:34:27.350 --> 05:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification so you are
 
05:34:29.510 --> 05:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
complicating matters a bit even though i
 
05:34:31.910 --> 05:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
will say that the sponsors of the bill
 
05:34:34.470 --> 05:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
very well intended in support of access
 
05:34:36.150 --> 05:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
to telehealth telemedicine which is
 
05:34:38.150 --> 05:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
something our agency feels very strongly
 
05:34:40.548 --> 05:34:40.558 align:start position:0%
about but the bill is currently written
 
05:34:42.628 --> 05:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
um has some
 
05:34:44.230 --> 05:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
significant mechanical at least
 
05:34:45.670 --> 05:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
mechanical defect in terms of the
 
05:34:48.150 --> 05:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
language but also as pointed out by
 
05:34:49.750 --> 05:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative knurk
 
05:34:52.470 --> 05:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
the department nor the office of
 
05:34:54.390 --> 05:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
professional licensure certification or
 
05:34:56.868 --> 05:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
the insurance department uh had an
 
05:34:58.868 --> 05:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in by doing a
 
05:35:00.548 --> 05:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis of the bill so we do
 
05:35:02.470 --> 05:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
come here before you today to raising at
 
05:35:05.270 --> 05:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
least concerns as to not only placement
 
05:35:07.190 --> 05:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
what the language does but it doesn't
 
05:35:09.590 --> 05:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
provide for any resources for any of the
 
05:35:11.270 --> 05:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
state agencies involved to provide the
 
05:35:12.628 --> 05:35:12.638 align:start position:0%
services that are
 
05:35:14.070 --> 05:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
our additional work that needs to be
 
05:35:15.990 --> 05:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
done again want to applaud the sponsor
 
05:35:19.350 --> 05:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
for the bill because she obviously is a
 
05:35:22.230 --> 05:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
stalwart in terms of promoting access to
 
05:35:24.948 --> 05:35:24.958 align:start position:0%
health care we also agree with dr hinck
 
05:35:27.030 --> 05:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
on behalf of both when he was here
 
05:35:28.948 --> 05:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
presenting on behalf the medical society
 
05:35:30.390 --> 05:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
and psychiatric
 
05:35:30.400 --> 05:35:31.910 align:start position:0%
and psychiatric
society

05:35:31.910 --> 05:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
society
 
05:35:34.628 --> 05:35:34.638 align:start position:0%
that the bill in a high level is is very
 
05:35:36.708 --> 05:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
well intended but if you look at what's
 
05:35:38.230 --> 05:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
in front of you and the questions need
 
05:35:40.150 --> 05:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
to be posed about line by line word by
 
05:35:42.548 --> 05:35:42.558 align:start position:0%
word what does this actually does do
 
05:35:43.990 --> 05:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
how does it relate to the bill that you
 
05:35:45.990 --> 05:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
passed in 2019
 
05:35:47.990 --> 05:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
um which was senate bill um i believe it
 
05:35:50.628 --> 05:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
was let's see 232 which came before this
 
05:35:53.030 --> 05:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee as well uh and they created
 
05:35:54.948 --> 05:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
the psych pack which is essentially the
 
05:35:58.310 --> 05:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
psychology interstate um um agreement
 
05:36:00.310 --> 05:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
and so you there's a lot of unanswered
 
05:36:01.670 --> 05:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
questions there's a lot of work that has
 
05:36:03.750 --> 05:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
to be done with this bill to even assess
 
05:36:05.350 --> 05:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
what it actually does and then
 
05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
determining how does that promote
 
05:36:10.548 --> 05:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
better access to to care is is an
 
05:36:13.990 --> 05:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
important question so it requires us in
 
05:36:14.000 --> 05:36:15.430 align:start position:0%
important question so it requires us in
lines

05:36:15.430 --> 05:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
lines
 
05:36:16.708 --> 05:36:16.718 align:start position:0%
three through
 
05:36:18.948 --> 05:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
seven of the bill to do an annual report
 
05:36:21.350 --> 05:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
and conduct a needs-based analysis
 
05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
and provide that to the legislature
 
05:36:24.390 --> 05:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
regarding its determination of whether
 
05:36:26.548 --> 05:36:26.558 align:start position:0%
to declare a mental health emergency for
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
that year
 
05:36:29.270 --> 05:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of the fact that it
 
05:36:30.868 --> 05:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
provides for no appropriation it also
 
05:36:32.628 --> 05:36:32.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide with any clear standards
 
05:36:34.708 --> 05:36:34.718 align:start position:0%
as to the mechanism as to which an
 
05:36:37.750 --> 05:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
agency whether it's hhs or oplc office
 
05:36:38.788 --> 05:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
of professional licensure and
 
05:36:40.628 --> 05:36:40.638 align:start position:0%
certification would trigger that
 
05:36:40.638 --> 05:36:41.990 align:start position:0%
certification would trigger that
particular

05:36:41.990 --> 05:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:36:45.190 --> 05:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
event so um regrettably we're we're here
 
05:36:47.830 --> 05:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
today obviously as a resource but in
 
05:36:49.430 --> 05:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
terms of representative king and i'm
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
praying that he doesn't ask us the same
 
05:36:53.110 --> 05:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
question that he asked of miss carbon uh
 
05:36:54.868 --> 05:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
we are here as a resource and i will do
 
05:36:56.548 --> 05:36:56.558 align:start position:0%
my best to dodge but i can't do as
 
05:36:58.390 --> 05:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
diplomatic with the job as miss carbon
 
05:37:00.470 --> 05:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
did bill do you have anything to
 
05:37:03.190 --> 05:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
add i don't i i would say that our our
 
05:37:04.868 --> 05:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
area of expertise here would be more in
 
05:37:06.948 --> 05:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
the mental health services mental health
 
05:37:06.958 --> 05:37:08.070 align:start position:0%
the mental health services mental health
services

05:37:08.070 --> 05:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:37:10.150 --> 05:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
system not so much the individuals
 
05:37:12.070 --> 05:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
regulated which is more the realm of
 
05:37:12.080 --> 05:37:13.830 align:start position:0%
regulated which is more the realm of
oplc

05:37:13.830 --> 05:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
05:37:15.510 --> 05:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
but if there's anything we could
 
05:37:17.110 --> 05:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
any questions we could answer concerning
 
05:37:19.510 --> 05:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
that system we'd be happy to and again
 
05:37:22.628 --> 05:37:22.638 align:start position:0%
our regulation really concerns the
 
05:37:24.470 --> 05:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
public mental health system not so much
 
05:37:26.390 --> 05:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
the private one so we couldn't really
 
05:37:28.708 --> 05:37:28.718 align:start position:0%
even capture all of the professionals
 
05:37:28.718 --> 05:37:30.310 align:start position:0%
even capture all of the professionals
practicing

05:37:30.310 --> 05:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
practicing
 
05:37:31.750 --> 05:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
that i think the bill would like to
 
05:37:31.760 --> 05:37:34.390 align:start position:0%
that i think the bill would like to
capture

05:37:34.390 --> 05:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:38.070 --> 05:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
any questions representative shapiro
 
05:37:40.150 --> 05:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:37:42.390 --> 05:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
both for taking this question i i heard
 
05:37:44.470 --> 05:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
you say there's some confusion in terms
 
05:37:44.480 --> 05:37:45.350 align:start position:0%
you say there's some confusion in terms
of

05:37:45.350 --> 05:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:37:45.360 --> 05:37:46.708 align:start position:0%
of
um

05:37:46.708 --> 05:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:49.830 --> 05:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
whether this paragraph um roman numeral
 
05:37:49.840 --> 05:37:52.708 align:start position:0%
whether this paragraph um roman numeral
2a

05:37:52.708 --> 05:37:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:55.510 --> 05:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
should be
 
05:37:58.548 --> 05:37:58.558 align:start position:0%
whether that task should be tasked to
 
05:38:00.708 --> 05:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure or
 
05:38:04.230 --> 05:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
whether it should be tasked to the
 
05:38:04.240 --> 05:38:06.868 align:start position:0%
whether it should be tasked to the
dhhs

05:38:06.868 --> 05:38:06.878 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
05:38:09.110 --> 05:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
or neither
 
05:38:12.070 --> 05:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
but if one of those organizations had to
 
05:38:14.150 --> 05:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
make a determination
 
05:38:15.510 --> 05:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
and i understand you're saying there's
 
05:38:18.230 --> 05:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
also not clear criteria but if there was
 
05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
clearer criteria
 
05:38:23.990 --> 05:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:25.910 --> 05:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
departments had to make
 
05:38:28.150 --> 05:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
this determination
 
05:38:28.160 --> 05:38:29.430 align:start position:0%
this determination
um

05:38:29.430 --> 05:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:32.070 --> 05:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
it does say it's based it does give a
 
05:38:33.670 --> 05:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
little criteria that it's based on the
 
05:38:35.590 --> 05:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of licensed mental health
 
05:38:35.600 --> 05:38:37.750 align:start position:0%
percentage of licensed mental health
professionals

05:38:37.750 --> 05:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
05:38:39.190 --> 05:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
residing in new hampshire if that's
 
05:38:40.470 --> 05:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
adequate to
 
05:38:42.470 --> 05:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
cover the needs which i understand is
 
05:38:44.230 --> 05:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
not maybe that precise
 
05:38:44.240 --> 05:38:44.948 align:start position:0%
not maybe that precise
but

05:38:44.948 --> 05:38:44.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:38:47.350 --> 05:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
my basic question is if one of those two
 
05:38:49.110 --> 05:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
departments would be in a better
 
05:38:51.190 --> 05:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
position to make this determination than
 
05:38:53.830 --> 05:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
the other which would it be
 
05:38:55.990 --> 05:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to defer because i really like
 
05:38:57.910 --> 05:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
attorney lindsey courtney who's sitting
 
05:39:00.628 --> 05:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
behind us um this this but if you're
 
05:39:02.788 --> 05:39:02.798 align:start position:0%
asking in terms of placement currently
 
05:39:05.510 --> 05:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
it is placed in the oplc statutes if you
 
05:39:08.230 --> 05:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
look at the preceding paragraph
 
05:39:10.070 --> 05:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
that deals with telehealth telemedicine
 
05:39:11.590 --> 05:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
and that's where the attorneys i presume
 
05:39:13.510 --> 05:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
at the office legislative services found
 
05:39:15.030 --> 05:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
a home for it under the professional
 
05:39:17.270 --> 05:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
life insurance certification it is a
 
05:39:19.510 --> 05:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
marked leap to place this upon the
 
05:39:21.030 --> 05:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
department of health human services who
 
05:39:24.070 --> 05:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
do not regulate uh individual uh
 
05:39:26.230 --> 05:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
licensees under that statute and in fact
 
05:39:28.390 --> 05:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
if you look at the preceding um
 
05:39:30.150 --> 05:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph that's not here because it's
 
05:39:32.708 --> 05:39:32.718 align:start position:0%
an add-on to that it gives you the whole
 
05:39:35.270 --> 05:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
host of all the specific chapter to rsas
 
05:39:36.628 --> 05:39:36.638 align:start position:0%
that are covered under telehealth
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
telemedicine which also begs without
 
05:39:40.390 --> 05:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
trying to get into devils into detail
 
05:39:42.150 --> 05:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
when you talk about licensed mental
 
05:39:43.750 --> 05:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
health professionals what is that
 
05:39:44.948 --> 05:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
universe because there's really no
 
05:39:47.430 --> 05:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
definition we get back to definitions
 
05:39:51.190 --> 05:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
and accuracy exacting language in bills
 
05:39:53.670 --> 05:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
and here are you also going to include
 
05:39:56.230 --> 05:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
or exclude for example those individuals
 
05:39:57.830 --> 05:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
with co-occurring disorders as it may
 
05:40:01.270 --> 05:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
relate to the alcohol and other drug use
 
05:40:03.030 --> 05:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
professionals that are actually licensed
 
05:40:04.788 --> 05:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
under here so there's a lot of
 
05:40:06.548 --> 05:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions but i think the
 
05:40:08.708 --> 05:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
clearest answer in terms of where this
 
05:40:11.030 --> 05:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
is housed it is housed with the office
 
05:40:12.150 --> 05:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
of professional licensure and
 
05:40:14.310 --> 05:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
certification because it comes under
 
05:40:16.788 --> 05:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
their executive directors and their
 
05:40:18.628 --> 05:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
agencies authority uh not the
 
05:40:20.628 --> 05:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
departments so that was a long-winded
 
05:40:22.470 --> 05:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
answer to your question about who should
 
05:40:23.830 --> 05:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
be getting this
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i'll try to take
 
05:40:32.470 --> 05:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
it easy on you mrs williams
 
05:40:34.708 --> 05:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
i think what i'm hearing
 
05:40:36.948 --> 05:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
is that there's two things one and being
 
05:40:36.958 --> 05:40:38.310 align:start position:0%
is that there's two things one and being
conflated

05:40:38.310 --> 05:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
conflated
 
05:40:40.830 --> 05:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
there's a declaration of
 
05:40:43.270 --> 05:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
emergency which i think should fall
 
05:40:44.868 --> 05:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
under the department of health and human
 
05:40:46.868 --> 05:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
services possibly even the legislative
 
05:40:48.708 --> 05:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
05:40:50.390 --> 05:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
and then number two is a question about
 
05:40:52.390 --> 05:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
the licensing
 
05:40:54.310 --> 05:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
so in essence the two agencies really
 
05:40:57.270 --> 05:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
have two different roles one is that the
 
05:40:59.670 --> 05:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
department health human services
 
05:41:01.350 --> 05:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
is the one responsible for declaring the
 
05:41:01.360 --> 05:41:02.948 align:start position:0%
is the one responsible for declaring the
emergency

05:41:02.948 --> 05:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
05:41:05.190 --> 05:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
but the issue about oplc and licensing
 
05:41:06.708 --> 05:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
resides with them
 
05:41:08.788 --> 05:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
is that a fair way
 
05:41:10.868 --> 05:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
and chairman pearson
 
05:41:11.830 --> 05:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
as you
 
05:41:13.430 --> 05:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
will observe from other bills that have
 
05:41:14.548 --> 05:41:14.558 align:start position:0%
been before you but i'm going to keep it
 
05:41:16.390 --> 05:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
specific to the language uh question
 
05:41:18.470 --> 05:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
here that when you typically think of
 
05:41:20.548 --> 05:41:20.558 align:start position:0%
our commissioner's emergency power
 
05:41:23.270 --> 05:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
authority it falls under 141c which is
 
05:41:25.430 --> 05:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
public health not mental so mental
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
health so this would be even though i
 
05:41:29.270 --> 05:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
can't disagree that the subject matter
 
05:41:30.708 --> 05:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
is certainly of importance of the
 
05:41:32.070 --> 05:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
department access to tell health
 
05:41:34.150 --> 05:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
telemedicine important to the department
 
05:41:36.868 --> 05:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
but this is a significant leap in terms
 
05:41:40.150 --> 05:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
of our current authority for declaring
 
05:41:42.230 --> 05:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
emergencies based upon
 
05:41:45.030 --> 05:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
a mental health emergency and i would
 
05:41:45.040 --> 05:41:45.910 align:start position:0%
a mental health emergency and i would
ask

05:41:45.910 --> 05:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
ask
 
05:41:47.990 --> 05:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
the attorney the wonderful attorney i
 
05:41:49.350 --> 05:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
felt bradley if he has anything else to
 
05:41:49.360 --> 05:41:50.310 align:start position:0%
felt bradley if he has anything else to
offer

05:41:50.310 --> 05:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
offer
 
05:41:52.470 --> 05:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
sure i i would simply add that that the
 
05:41:54.868 --> 05:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
information we would need to declare
 
05:41:58.150 --> 05:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
that emergency would come from uh oplc
 
05:41:59.670 --> 05:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
which would know the number of licensed
 
05:42:02.310 --> 05:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
professionals and perhaps have data as
 
05:42:06.150 --> 05:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
to the correct number uh per 100 000 of
 
05:42:08.628 --> 05:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
population or something like that which
 
05:42:10.230 --> 05:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
is probably
 
05:42:12.788 --> 05:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
information studies have published
 
05:42:14.868 --> 05:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
so we would have to use information that
 
05:42:16.548 --> 05:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
comes from another agency
 
05:42:18.150 --> 05:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
we don't currently have access to that
 
05:42:21.350 --> 05:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
information as far as i i know
 
05:42:23.910 --> 05:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative merchant follow up
 
05:42:26.230 --> 05:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you both with the attorneys
 
05:42:28.628 --> 05:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
um i understand getting data from
 
05:42:30.070 --> 05:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
another agency i think it's something
 
05:42:31.750 --> 05:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
you probably as an agency already do
 
05:42:33.350 --> 05:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
today with other things
 
05:42:35.350 --> 05:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it's foreign to the
 
05:42:36.948 --> 05:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
05:42:39.750 --> 05:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
number two mr williams please
 
05:42:42.948 --> 05:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
um number two in regards to
 
05:42:44.628 --> 05:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
your point about public health i
 
05:42:45.750 --> 05:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
understand what you're trying to get to
 
05:42:46.868 --> 05:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm thinking maybe it's
 
05:42:48.230 --> 05:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
more like the legislative oversight
 
05:42:48.240 --> 05:42:49.350 align:start position:0%
more like the legislative oversight
committee

05:42:49.350 --> 05:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:42:49.360 --> 05:42:50.628 align:start position:0%
committee
provides

05:42:50.628 --> 05:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
provides
 
05:42:53.030 --> 05:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
the will through the department that
 
05:42:55.030 --> 05:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
authority therefore
 
05:42:56.310 --> 05:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
you're trading into an area which i
 
05:42:58.150 --> 05:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with public health this
 
05:42:59.190 --> 05:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
could be public health but i think
 
05:43:01.030 --> 05:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
having a legislative oversight committee
 
05:43:02.708 --> 05:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
being there with the department may help
 
05:43:06.310 --> 05:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:07.990 --> 05:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
so chairman pearson to the first
 
05:43:09.750 --> 05:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
question which is do we
 
05:43:11.430 --> 05:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
receive information from other state
 
05:43:12.548 --> 05:43:12.558 align:start position:0%
agencies the answer is absolutely
 
05:43:14.548 --> 05:43:14.558 align:start position:0%
correct we do work very collaboratively
 
05:43:17.750 --> 05:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
with state agencies and in many examples
 
05:43:19.350 --> 05:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
they're obviously the architectures
 
05:43:21.910 --> 05:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
through legislation that provides the
 
05:43:23.430 --> 05:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
map for which we would do that
 
05:43:26.390 --> 05:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
information sharing with them however in
 
05:43:27.750 --> 05:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
the same respect that you're hearing
 
05:43:30.070 --> 05:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
from our agency regardless of who ends
 
05:43:32.868 --> 05:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
up being tasked with this very uh
 
05:43:35.590 --> 05:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
arguably very important
 
05:43:35.600 --> 05:43:36.390 align:start position:0%
arguably very important
issue

05:43:36.390 --> 05:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:43:38.470 --> 05:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
that there's no funding mechanism in
 
05:43:41.430 --> 05:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
here to take on base based upon already
 
05:43:41.440 --> 05:43:42.150 align:start position:0%
here to take on base based upon already
the

05:43:42.150 --> 05:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:43:44.150 --> 05:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
enormous work that we do um with
 
05:43:45.830 --> 05:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
resources so there's nothing specific
 
05:43:47.590 --> 05:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
that i'm aware of that would provide for
 
05:43:49.270 --> 05:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
us to leverage any funding to be able to
 
05:43:51.510 --> 05:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
do this and i'm going to ask attorney
 
05:43:52.788 --> 05:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
bradley to make sure that there's
 
05:43:54.150 --> 05:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
nothing he might be aware of that i'm
 
05:43:56.390 --> 05:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
not uh no there's there's there's
 
05:43:58.788 --> 05:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
nothing else i would just make one more
 
05:44:01.270 --> 05:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
observation i did find the discussion on
 
05:44:03.990 --> 05:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
the interstate compact for mental health
 
05:44:04.000 --> 05:44:05.190 align:start position:0%
the interstate compact for mental health
counselors

05:44:05.190 --> 05:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
counselors
 
05:44:08.230 --> 05:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
and uh reciprocity very interesting and
 
05:44:10.150 --> 05:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps something like that could be
 
05:44:10.160 --> 05:44:15.110 align:start position:0%
perhaps something like that could be
helpful

05:44:15.110 --> 05:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:19.590 --> 05:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:20.788 --> 05:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
he's running
 
05:44:22.868 --> 05:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
he's running
 
05:44:22.878 --> 05:44:24.830 align:start position:0%
he's running
he

05:44:24.830 --> 05:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
he
 
05:44:29.510 --> 05:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
is now while he's still in the room
 
05:44:33.590 --> 05:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
he's given lindsay courtney a big gift
 
05:44:46.070 --> 05:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:47.590 --> 05:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
05:44:49.190 --> 05:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
the committee lindsey courtney executive
 
05:44:50.548 --> 05:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
director office of professional
 
05:44:53.750 --> 05:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification
 
05:44:56.150 --> 05:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
certainly supports the purpose of this
 
05:44:56.160 --> 05:44:57.190 align:start position:0%
certainly supports the purpose of this
bill

05:44:57.190 --> 05:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:44:59.190 --> 05:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
there certainly is a shortage of mental
 
05:45:00.788 --> 05:45:00.798 align:start position:0%
health workers
 
05:45:02.868 --> 05:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
i do want to
 
05:45:04.070 --> 05:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
kind of talk a little bit about what
 
05:45:06.070 --> 05:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
we've been doing in that sphere in order
 
05:45:06.080 --> 05:45:06.868 align:start position:0%
we've been doing in that sphere in order
to

05:45:06.868 --> 05:45:06.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:45:08.390 --> 05:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
bridge the gap
 
05:45:09.750 --> 05:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
as you're all aware you know the
 
05:45:11.670 --> 05:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
governor issued an executive order back
 
05:45:11.680 --> 05:45:12.548 align:start position:0%
governor issued an executive order back
in

05:45:12.548 --> 05:45:12.558 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:45:14.470 --> 05:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
i think it was march of 2020 now that
 
05:45:15.990 --> 05:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
would authorize the office to issue
 
05:45:18.548 --> 05:45:18.558 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses based on
 
05:45:21.510 --> 05:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
having a license in another jurisdiction
 
05:45:24.310 --> 05:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
we were interested to find
 
05:45:25.670 --> 05:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
at least in the first couple weeks that
 
05:45:27.670 --> 05:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
the majority of those that we licensed
 
05:45:30.150 --> 05:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
were indeed mental health workers a lot
 
05:45:32.230 --> 05:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
of them were from neighboring states
 
05:45:34.788 --> 05:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
vermont massachusetts who may
 
05:45:36.390 --> 05:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
have switched to a telehealth platform
 
05:45:37.910 --> 05:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
and by virtue of that needed a new
 
05:45:40.150 --> 05:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire license i think that was
 
05:45:42.070 --> 05:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
interesting data that demonstrate
 
05:45:43.990 --> 05:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrated what we already know to be
 
05:45:45.430 --> 05:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
true which is that we have a shortage of
 
05:45:48.070 --> 05:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
mental health workers in this state
 
05:45:50.628 --> 05:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic we licensed 22
 
05:45:53.910 --> 05:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
000 health care workers
 
05:45:57.670 --> 05:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
and 63 percent of psychologists who were
 
05:45:59.750 --> 05:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
active to practice in new hampshire
 
05:46:01.670 --> 05:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
during the state of emergency
 
05:46:03.910 --> 05:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
i think it was 45
 
05:46:06.310 --> 05:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
of mental health counselors were doing
 
05:46:08.708 --> 05:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
so only on an emergency license and so i
 
05:46:09.750 --> 05:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
think that
 
05:46:11.830 --> 05:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
again is data that demonstrates that we
 
05:46:13.670 --> 05:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
do have a significant shortage of mental
 
05:46:15.430 --> 05:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
health workers
 
05:46:17.350 --> 05:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
05:46:21.510 --> 05:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
the general court passed a bill that we
 
05:46:23.670 --> 05:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
fully supported and requested that gave
 
05:46:25.270 --> 05:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
the office the authority to issue
 
05:46:28.230 --> 05:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
temporary licenses for 120 days based on
 
05:46:29.750 --> 05:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
the same criteria
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
so as it stands right now if you're a
 
05:46:33.910 --> 05:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare professional another state
 
05:46:36.230 --> 05:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
you apply to the office you present an
 
05:46:38.230 --> 05:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
informal verification you have a license
 
05:46:39.910 --> 05:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
in another state
 
05:46:41.750 --> 05:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
that could just be a screenshot of the
 
05:46:44.070 --> 05:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
other state's licensing portal
 
05:46:45.990 --> 05:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
we license you generally in about 24
 
05:46:47.990 --> 05:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
business hours provided that your
 
05:46:49.670 --> 05:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
application is complete
 
05:46:52.788 --> 05:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
and that gives the provider 120 days to
 
05:46:54.788 --> 05:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
submit their permanent application which
 
05:46:57.990 --> 05:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
we have found a lot of providers utilize
 
05:47:00.390 --> 05:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
to hit the ground running start working
 
05:47:01.670 --> 05:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:47:03.510 --> 05:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
seek permanent licensure if they so
 
05:47:03.520 --> 05:47:05.510 align:start position:0%
seek permanent licensure if they so
desire

05:47:05.510 --> 05:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
desire
 
05:47:07.670 --> 05:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's uh so right now under senate
 
05:47:09.990 --> 05:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
bill 155 the
 
05:47:13.030 --> 05:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
22 000 health care licenses that were
 
05:47:14.628 --> 05:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
issued under the state of emergency are
 
05:47:16.788 --> 05:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
slated to expire
 
05:47:19.270 --> 05:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
what we did i think it was uh i don't
 
05:47:21.350 --> 05:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
know the exact date um earlier this
 
05:47:23.670 --> 05:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
month we promulgated an emergency rule
 
05:47:25.110 --> 05:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
through the office
 
05:47:26.788 --> 05:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
to essentially convert all of those
 
05:47:29.910 --> 05:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
licenses to temporary licenses for 120
 
05:47:31.990 --> 05:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
days that was pursuant to the statutory
 
05:47:33.910 --> 05:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
authority i just referenced
 
05:47:34.948 --> 05:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
so we
 
05:47:37.430 --> 05:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
extended those license essentially and
 
05:47:41.030 --> 05:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
those licenses will expire on may 31st
 
05:47:42.230 --> 05:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
which gives the general court an
 
05:47:43.750 --> 05:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to figure out what to do
 
05:47:45.830 --> 05:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
with those licenses
 
05:47:47.830 --> 05:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
there is a bill pending right now it's
 
05:47:50.548 --> 05:47:50.558 align:start position:0%
senate bill 277
 
05:47:53.510 --> 05:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
that would as as drafted
 
05:47:54.788 --> 05:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
it would
 
05:47:57.190 --> 05:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
extend those licenses in additional two
 
05:47:57.200 --> 05:47:58.628 align:start position:0%
extend those licenses in additional two
years

05:47:58.628 --> 05:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:48:00.708 --> 05:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
the office had recommended that rather
 
05:48:02.868 --> 05:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
than just simply extending the licenses
 
05:48:04.628 --> 05:48:04.638 align:start position:0%
that we convert those licenses to
 
05:48:08.548 --> 05:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
permanent licensure which would then
 
05:48:10.230 --> 05:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
require that the individuals actually
 
05:48:12.708 --> 05:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
affirmatively do something to to to
 
05:48:15.430 --> 05:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
request re-licensure but as well as meet
 
05:48:16.868 --> 05:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
the continuing education and other
 
05:48:18.390 --> 05:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
requirements established by the boards
 
05:48:19.750 --> 05:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
it would give the boards an opportunity
 
05:48:22.070 --> 05:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
to look at those applications
 
05:48:24.708 --> 05:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
i don't think that proposal is going to
 
05:48:26.230 --> 05:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
go forward some of our mental health
 
05:48:28.708 --> 05:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
boards strongly opposed
 
05:48:30.708 --> 05:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
that proposal
 
05:48:32.070 --> 05:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of other things in
 
05:48:34.868 --> 05:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
the works there's senate bill 330 which
 
05:48:37.670 --> 05:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
would allow the office to
 
05:48:40.868 --> 05:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
issue licenses to individuals who have a
 
05:48:42.470 --> 05:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
license that's substantially equivalent
 
05:48:44.470 --> 05:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
in another jurisdiction a permanent
 
05:48:44.480 --> 05:48:45.910 align:start position:0%
in another jurisdiction a permanent
license

05:48:45.910 --> 05:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:48:47.990 --> 05:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
what we learned throughout the pandemic
 
05:48:50.150 --> 05:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
after issuing 22 000 licenses is that we
 
05:48:51.670 --> 05:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
only received a handful of complaints
 
05:48:54.470 --> 05:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
and none went to adjudication
 
05:48:57.110 --> 05:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
so that to us was a good data
 
05:48:58.708 --> 05:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that at least if you've
 
05:49:00.788 --> 05:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
actively practiced another state you've
 
05:49:03.430 --> 05:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
been vetted by another state we can
 
05:49:05.830 --> 05:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
reasonably rely on that state and maybe
 
05:49:08.708 --> 05:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
there's there's not um
 
05:49:10.868 --> 05:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
sufficient reason for us to impose all
 
05:49:12.070 --> 05:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
these additional application
 
05:49:14.230 --> 05:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
requirements so that's senate bill 330.
 
05:49:15.270 --> 05:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know where that one's going to
 
05:49:17.430 --> 05:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
go because a couple of our licensing
 
05:49:17.440 --> 05:49:18.390 align:start position:0%
go because a couple of our licensing
boards

05:49:18.390 --> 05:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
boards
 
05:49:20.948 --> 05:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
in the mental health sphere are
 
05:49:22.868 --> 05:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
are opposed
 
05:49:24.310 --> 05:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:49:24.320 --> 05:49:25.590 align:start position:0%
the um
we

05:49:25.590 --> 05:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:49:27.350 --> 05:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
we have the compact requirement for the
 
05:49:30.470 --> 05:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
side packed we've also proposed uh
 
05:49:33.990 --> 05:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
through i think it's senate bill
 
05:49:35.990 --> 05:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
forget that i forget the actual bill
 
05:49:38.070 --> 05:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
number but there's a mental health
 
05:49:40.948 --> 05:49:40.958 align:start position:0%
compact bill we've proposed to join the
 
05:49:42.628 --> 05:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
mental health compact for mental health
 
05:49:43.990 --> 05:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
counselors that's going to be going
 
05:49:46.070 --> 05:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
through this session again this year
 
05:49:47.750 --> 05:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
that for mental health counselors would
 
05:49:50.390 --> 05:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
provide greater portability so we talked
 
05:49:52.070 --> 05:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
about psychologists
 
05:49:53.670 --> 05:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
this is another way
 
05:49:55.430 --> 05:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
so i think the state is headed in the
 
05:49:57.350 --> 05:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
right direction in terms of recognizing
 
05:49:59.510 --> 05:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
portability um
 
05:50:01.350 --> 05:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
we do have concerns over the language of
 
05:50:03.110 --> 05:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
this bill because i'm not sure that it
 
05:50:03.120 --> 05:50:05.430 align:start position:0%
this bill because i'm not sure that it
fully

05:50:05.430 --> 05:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
fully
 
05:50:07.270 --> 05:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
if it fully does what i think it's
 
05:50:09.030 --> 05:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
intended to do particularly we have
 
05:50:09.040 --> 05:50:10.628 align:start position:0%
intended to do particularly we have
concerns

05:50:10.628 --> 05:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:50:12.150 --> 05:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't really be adequately
 
05:50:13.910 --> 05:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
protecting the public so the purpose of
 
05:50:15.510 --> 05:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
a licensing body and the purpose of a
 
05:50:17.990 --> 05:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
license is to protect the public within
 
05:50:19.750 --> 05:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:50:19.760 --> 05:50:20.628 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
the

05:50:20.628 --> 05:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
limitation on five patients seems
 
05:50:26.470 --> 05:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
somewhat arbitrary if the state has
 
05:50:28.868 --> 05:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
determined that we need a license and we
 
05:50:30.708 --> 05:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
need to have providers meet certain
 
05:50:32.390 --> 05:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements in order to
 
05:50:34.788 --> 05:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
demonstrate minimum competency
 
05:50:37.590 --> 05:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
why would those five patients not um
 
05:50:39.750 --> 05:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
not be subject to the benefit of of
 
05:50:42.628 --> 05:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
having that vetting process
 
05:50:45.030 --> 05:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
seems a little arbitrary
 
05:50:45.040 --> 05:50:46.230 align:start position:0%
seems a little arbitrary
um

05:50:46.230 --> 05:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:47.510 --> 05:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
we also
 
05:50:48.470 --> 05:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:50:50.310 --> 05:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the need for talk
 
05:50:50.320 --> 05:50:51.430 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the need for talk
therapy

05:50:51.430 --> 05:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
05:50:53.590 --> 05:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
and certainly mental health counselors
 
05:50:56.150 --> 05:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
but there is a reason why we
 
05:50:58.390 --> 05:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
we require licensure for mental health
 
05:50:58.400 --> 05:50:59.590 align:start position:0%
we require licensure for mental health
counselors

05:50:59.590 --> 05:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
counselors
 
05:51:01.830 --> 05:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
this bill would essentially take those
 
05:51:03.830 --> 05:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
licensees outside the jurisdiction of
 
05:51:06.150 --> 05:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
any new hampshire licensing body
 
05:51:06.160 --> 05:51:07.350 align:start position:0%
any new hampshire licensing body
so

05:51:07.350 --> 05:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:09.910 --> 05:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
if there was an issue and in the mental
 
05:51:11.990 --> 05:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
health sphere what we see most
 
05:51:14.310 --> 05:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
frequently in terms of complaints
 
05:51:17.190 --> 05:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
is complaints regarding boundaries
 
05:51:17.200 --> 05:51:18.948 align:start position:0%
is complaints regarding boundaries
people

05:51:18.948 --> 05:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:51:21.430 --> 05:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
not adhering to appropriate boundaries
 
05:51:23.270 --> 05:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
people getting into relationships with
 
05:51:24.868 --> 05:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
their patients
 
05:51:27.270 --> 05:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
people who are already
 
05:51:29.270 --> 05:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know vulnerable
 
05:51:31.110 --> 05:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
expressing things to their therapist
 
05:51:32.310 --> 05:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't normally talk to
 
05:51:33.750 --> 05:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
others about
 
05:51:35.590 --> 05:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's what we see most often and so
 
05:51:37.590 --> 05:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
there is a need for regulation
 
05:51:39.990 --> 05:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
under this proposed legislation there's
 
05:51:43.350 --> 05:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
no new hampshire licensing body
 
05:51:44.788 --> 05:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
that would actually be able to take
 
05:51:44.798 --> 05:51:45.910 align:start position:0%
that would actually be able to take
action

05:51:45.910 --> 05:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
action
 
05:51:47.350 --> 05:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
on a complaint
 
05:51:47.360 --> 05:51:48.310 align:start position:0%
on a complaint
if

05:51:48.310 --> 05:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:51:50.788 --> 05:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
if the provider did not comply with
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations so we have we have
 
05:51:55.590 --> 05:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
some concerns about that
 
05:51:58.548 --> 05:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
um and then finally practically um
 
05:52:01.350 --> 05:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
the bill at section three
 
05:52:03.110 --> 05:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
speaks of a requirement to conduct an
 
05:52:04.470 --> 05:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
annual audit
 
05:52:07.350 --> 05:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
we we are not sure what what the audit
 
05:52:09.510 --> 05:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
would entail i think that certainly that
 
05:52:12.310 --> 05:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
could be hashed out an amendment um
 
05:52:13.910 --> 05:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
and of course we would have we would
 
05:52:15.910 --> 05:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
like an opportunity to do an analysis to
 
05:52:17.270 --> 05:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
see whether there could be a fiscal
 
05:52:17.280 --> 05:52:19.030 align:start position:0%
see whether there could be a fiscal
impact

05:52:19.030 --> 05:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
impact
 
05:52:20.788 --> 05:52:20.798 align:start position:0%
certainly the office like many agencies
 
05:52:22.788 --> 05:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
are kind of stretched too thin right now
 
05:52:22.798 --> 05:52:23.670 align:start position:0%
are kind of stretched too thin right now
and

05:52:23.670 --> 05:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:52:23.680 --> 05:52:24.470 align:start position:0%
and
so

05:52:24.470 --> 05:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:52:26.470 --> 05:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
we have some concerns not knowing what
 
05:52:27.750 --> 05:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
an audit
 
05:52:29.190 --> 05:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
would require
 
05:52:30.788 --> 05:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
05:52:33.510 --> 05:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have
 
05:52:36.868 --> 05:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
05:52:38.708 --> 05:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:52:40.708 --> 05:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
for taking the questions i have two
 
05:52:43.830 --> 05:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:43.840 --> 05:52:44.868 align:start position:0%
 
one

05:52:44.868 --> 05:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:52:47.750 --> 05:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
relative to discussion during the last
 
05:52:47.760 --> 05:52:48.708 align:start position:0%
relative to discussion during the last
first

05:52:48.708 --> 05:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:52:57.270 --> 05:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:59.990 --> 05:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
how well-suited would the office of
 
05:53:02.868 --> 05:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
professional licensing be
 
05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
to um
 
05:53:08.070 --> 05:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
figure out the criteria for
 
05:53:10.708 --> 05:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
and analyze whether there is
 
05:53:13.270 --> 05:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
quotes a mental health emergency
 
05:53:16.788 --> 05:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
um if that task was fell to your
 
05:53:16.798 --> 05:53:19.990 align:start position:0%
um if that task was fell to your
department

05:53:19.990 --> 05:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:22.230 --> 05:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
would that work
 
05:53:25.030 --> 05:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
so i think uh we would need
 
05:53:27.110 --> 05:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
more direction the office would need
 
05:53:29.430 --> 05:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
more direction as to what constitutes a
 
05:53:31.110 --> 05:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
mental health emergency so certainly we
 
05:53:33.830 --> 05:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
know how many providers we have what we
 
05:53:36.070 --> 05:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
don't know is how many active providers
 
05:53:38.070 --> 05:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
are actually practicing a lot of people
 
05:53:39.750 --> 05:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
keep up with their licenses their
 
05:53:41.350 --> 05:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
continuing education don't actually
 
05:53:43.670 --> 05:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
practice so we don't collect that data
 
05:53:45.510 --> 05:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
so it may not be as reliable as you
 
05:53:46.470 --> 05:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
would think
 
05:53:47.590 --> 05:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
i think the general court could
 
05:53:50.868 --> 05:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
certainly say in legislation um you know
 
05:53:53.190 --> 05:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
we need x number of providers per you
 
05:53:55.270 --> 05:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
know thousand individuals and that would
 
05:53:57.350 --> 05:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
take the discretion out of it
 
05:53:58.948 --> 05:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
my sense is that you know we're going to
 
05:54:00.310 --> 05:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
be in a mental health emergency for a
 
05:54:03.990 --> 05:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
long time um so i i'm not really sure
 
05:54:07.270 --> 05:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
whether the declaration is required um
 
05:54:09.910 --> 05:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
to me you know you could just take that
 
05:54:11.350 --> 05:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
out of it
 
05:54:13.990 --> 05:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that would alleviate any
 
05:54:14.000 --> 05:54:15.670 align:start position:0%
and i think that would alleviate any
issues

05:54:15.670 --> 05:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:54:17.430 --> 05:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:54:19.430 --> 05:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
um yes i'm one of those people with a
 
05:54:21.510 --> 05:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
license who's not currently working so
 
05:54:25.670 --> 05:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:28.708 --> 05:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
and so i so what i heard you say to that
 
05:54:30.548 --> 05:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
question was that
 
05:54:32.230 --> 05:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
we could just assume that there's a
 
05:54:33.670 --> 05:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
mental health emergency for the
 
05:54:37.110 --> 05:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
immediate future um
 
05:54:40.708 --> 05:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
getting back to what you said that um
 
05:54:43.350 --> 05:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
has been done in terms of
 
05:54:48.310 --> 05:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
um people with a license elsewhere
 
05:54:49.830 --> 05:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
and i guess we're talking about a lot of
 
05:54:51.910 --> 05:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
different groups people are using the
 
05:54:53.430 --> 05:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
term mental health counselors but
 
05:54:55.030 --> 05:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
they're social workers as mental health
 
05:54:56.868 --> 05:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
counselors there's
 
05:54:59.830 --> 05:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder
 
05:54:59.840 --> 05:55:01.990 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder
clinicians

05:55:01.990 --> 05:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
clinicians
 
05:55:04.150 --> 05:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm not even sure if this included
 
05:55:06.390 --> 05:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists but we did have someone
 
05:55:08.830 --> 05:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
testify about psychiatrists as well
 
05:55:08.840 --> 05:55:10.548 align:start position:0%
testify about psychiatrists as well
um

05:55:10.548 --> 05:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:13.830 --> 05:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
but can you clarify um in terms of the
 
05:55:15.190 --> 05:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
05:55:15.200 --> 05:55:15.990 align:start position:0%
issue of
um

05:55:15.990 --> 05:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:18.390 --> 05:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
people currently seeing somebody from
 
05:55:19.510 --> 05:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
05:55:21.030 --> 05:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
and that's gonna
 
05:55:22.708 --> 05:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that will terminate at
 
05:55:24.868 --> 05:55:24.878 align:start position:0%
the end of january
 
05:55:27.190 --> 05:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
um it's now may 31st correct if they
 
05:55:30.070 --> 05:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
have only an emergency license may 31st
 
05:55:31.750 --> 05:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
crashed okay
 
05:55:33.510 --> 05:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:55:37.030 --> 05:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:38.548 --> 05:55:38.558 align:start position:0%
that's not going to change until may
 
05:55:40.788 --> 05:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
31st and you're saying there are some
 
05:55:40.798 --> 05:55:41.830 align:start position:0%
31st and you're saying there are some
bills

05:55:41.830 --> 05:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
bills
 
05:55:41.840 --> 05:55:43.430 align:start position:0%
bills
um

05:55:43.430 --> 05:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:44.868 --> 05:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
there are currently some bills that
 
05:55:47.430 --> 05:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
might extend that for quite a ways past
 
05:55:47.440 --> 05:55:48.708 align:start position:0%
might extend that for quite a ways past
that

05:55:48.708 --> 05:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:55:50.230 --> 05:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
05:55:53.430 --> 05:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
yep it senate bills uh 277.
 
05:55:56.230 --> 05:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
it was just heard by senate finance um
 
05:55:58.868 --> 05:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
that would effectively extend uh these
 
05:56:01.750 --> 05:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses what we don't know we
 
05:56:03.910 --> 05:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
have 22 000 licenses but what we don't
 
05:56:05.830 --> 05:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
know is how many of them have actually
 
05:56:08.070 --> 05:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
already sought permanent licensure
 
05:56:11.510 --> 05:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
because the data sets are different
 
05:56:13.750 --> 05:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when
 
05:56:15.670 --> 05:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
when you compare the data sets they just
 
05:56:18.548 --> 05:56:18.558 align:start position:0%
can't be effectively compared so many of
 
05:56:20.548 --> 05:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
these individuals probably have already
 
05:56:23.270 --> 05:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
either sought permanent licensure or
 
05:56:24.868 --> 05:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
they were traveling healthcare workers
 
05:56:26.628 --> 05:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
that a lot of our facilities are relying
 
05:56:29.190 --> 05:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
on and the four months or the the time
 
05:56:30.470 --> 05:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
during the state of emergency was
 
05:56:30.480 --> 05:56:31.670 align:start position:0%
during the state of emergency was
sufficient

05:56:31.670 --> 05:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
05:56:34.548 --> 05:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
so we really don't know how many
 
05:56:36.628 --> 05:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
would would continue out of the 22 000
 
05:56:38.310 --> 05:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
which is why the office proposed that
 
05:56:40.150 --> 05:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
they be converted so then they would
 
05:56:42.470 --> 05:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
have to renew and it would give the
 
05:56:44.310 --> 05:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
licensing board an opportunity to vet
 
05:56:47.510 --> 05:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
their credentials at that time and the
 
05:56:49.270 --> 05:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
person would have to affirmatively you
 
05:56:51.190 --> 05:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
know apply and say yes i still want a
 
05:56:51.200 --> 05:56:53.670 align:start position:0%
know apply and say yes i still want a
license

05:56:53.670 --> 05:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:56:54.548 --> 05:56:54.558 align:start position:0%
one more
 
05:56:56.470 --> 05:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
so for those people who have already
 
05:56:58.788 --> 05:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
sought a new hampshire license or do so
 
05:57:01.350 --> 05:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
before may 31st
 
05:57:03.590 --> 05:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
they won't be limited to five seeing
 
05:57:05.590 --> 05:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
five people from new hampshire
 
05:57:07.750 --> 05:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
there won't be any limits
 
05:57:09.670 --> 05:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
correct if you have a if you have a new
 
05:57:12.628 --> 05:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:15.030 --> 05:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
you you are permitted to provide
 
05:57:16.628 --> 05:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
services to new hampshire a person
 
05:57:19.750 --> 05:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
physically located in new hampshire
 
05:57:19.760 --> 05:57:21.510 align:start position:0%
physically located in new hampshire
representative

05:57:21.510 --> 05:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:57:23.110 --> 05:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
just a quick question because you gave
 
05:57:25.990 --> 05:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
that 22 000 number a couple of times
 
05:57:27.270 --> 05:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
and with your comment about being
 
05:57:29.670 --> 05:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
travelers is that referring to only
 
05:57:32.390 --> 05:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
mental health providers or all providers
 
05:57:35.030 --> 05:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's all health care providers
 
05:57:37.430 --> 05:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
05:57:39.110 --> 05:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:57:41.430 --> 05:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
05:57:43.670 --> 05:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
so for uh mental health professionals
 
05:57:46.230 --> 05:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
and actually anyone um any medical
 
05:57:48.070 --> 05:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
professionals who are licensed in
 
05:57:50.470 --> 05:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
another state um for
 
05:57:52.868 --> 05:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
the issue of complaints could the
 
05:57:54.548 --> 05:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
patient file a complaint with the
 
05:57:57.030 --> 05:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
licensing board
 
05:57:58.708 --> 05:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
that is the source of that
 
05:58:01.030 --> 05:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
professional's license and seek
 
05:58:04.708 --> 05:58:04.718 align:start position:0%
you know um a resolution that way
 
05:58:06.470 --> 05:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
i think they certainly could um not
 
05:58:09.030 --> 05:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
being that jurisdiction i don't know
 
05:58:11.430 --> 05:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
what i would advise them um because what
 
05:58:14.548 --> 05:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
gives the licensing board jurisdiction
 
05:58:16.470 --> 05:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
over the complaint is the fact that the
 
05:58:19.590 --> 05:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
individual has a license
 
05:58:21.990 --> 05:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
here i think arguably
 
05:58:23.510 --> 05:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
because the patient would be physically
 
05:58:25.510 --> 05:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
located in new hampshire new hampshire
 
05:58:27.110 --> 05:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
law would apply
 
05:58:29.270 --> 05:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
new jersey law wouldn't apply
 
05:58:29.280 --> 05:58:30.310 align:start position:0%
new jersey law wouldn't apply
so

05:58:30.310 --> 05:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:58:30.320 --> 05:58:31.190 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:58:31.190 --> 05:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:32.708 --> 05:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
i guess that would be an open question i
 
05:58:34.150 --> 05:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
don't know i'd have to
 
05:58:36.070 --> 05:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
have to go back and take a look it's not
 
05:58:36.080 --> 05:58:39.990 align:start position:0%
have to go back and take a look it's not
clear

05:58:39.990 --> 05:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:42.390 --> 05:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
i did see another hand representative
 
05:58:42.400 --> 05:58:46.548 align:start position:0%
i did see another hand representative
merchant

05:58:46.548 --> 05:58:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:48.708 --> 05:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:58:51.110 --> 05:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
being here direct according
 
05:58:56.070 --> 05:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:56.080 --> 05:58:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
21-2

05:58:57.590 --> 05:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
21-2
 
05:58:59.910 --> 05:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
which talks about positions
 
05:59:02.230 --> 05:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
key to that was that the physician
 
05:59:03.670 --> 05:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
is taking responsibility for the
 
05:59:06.070 --> 05:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
out-of-state position
 
05:59:07.990 --> 05:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
could that same concept be applied here
 
05:59:09.670 --> 05:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
with a mental health worker
 
05:59:10.868 --> 05:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
where there's a
 
05:59:12.868 --> 05:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
person in the state who's taken
 
05:59:15.510 --> 05:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility therefore there is some
 
05:59:17.590 --> 05:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of our state
 
05:59:18.948 --> 05:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
over some
 
05:59:20.708 --> 05:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
licensed individual
 
05:59:22.470 --> 05:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
and they're taking on responsibility for
 
05:59:24.708 --> 05:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
the person from out of state
 
05:59:26.230 --> 05:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
i think that's true i think that could
 
05:59:27.990 --> 05:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
certainly happen i think the other
 
05:59:30.230 --> 05:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
distinction in 329 is that those who
 
05:59:32.070 --> 05:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
provide consultation services don't
 
05:59:33.510 --> 05:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
actually have a physician-patient
 
05:59:35.030 --> 05:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
relationship and i think that would be
 
05:59:37.590 --> 05:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
different here and that
 
05:59:40.070 --> 05:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire provider
 
05:59:41.430 --> 05:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire license provider
 
05:59:42.708 --> 05:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the one actually providing
 
05:59:44.390 --> 05:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
the services they would be the out of
 
05:59:45.910 --> 05:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
state and they would develop that
 
05:59:51.750 --> 05:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:52.948 --> 05:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
 
05:59:52.958 --> 05:59:55.190 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
time

05:59:55.190 --> 05:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:56.708 --> 05:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
and our friend from the new hampshire
 
05:59:58.708 --> 05:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
insurance department tyler brennan come
 
06:00:09.910 --> 06:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:11.750 --> 06:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you tyler brennan life and health
 
06:00:12.708 --> 06:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
director with the new hampshire
 
06:00:14.310 --> 06:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
06:00:16.390 --> 06:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
and we do not have a position on the
 
06:00:18.310 --> 06:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
bill and i'm going to address just the
 
06:00:20.470 --> 06:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
insurance sections i think so far we've
 
06:00:22.628 --> 06:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
just heard more about licensing
 
06:00:24.230 --> 06:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
but there is a substantial component to
 
06:00:26.628 --> 06:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
the insurance side and just by way of
 
06:00:28.390 --> 06:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
background we actually already have
 
06:00:30.628 --> 06:00:30.638 align:start position:0%
fairly broad coverage requirements when
 
06:00:32.708 --> 06:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
it comes to telemedicine and that
 
06:00:35.510 --> 06:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
section is under 415j and it's even
 
06:00:37.030 --> 06:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
titled the new hampshire telemedicine
 
06:00:37.040 --> 06:00:37.990 align:start position:0%
titled the new hampshire telemedicine
act

06:00:37.990 --> 06:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
act
 
06:00:40.070 --> 06:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
it requires coverage of all healthcare
 
06:00:42.150 --> 06:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
services through telemedicine insurance
 
06:00:44.070 --> 06:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
company can't deny just because it went
 
06:00:46.070 --> 06:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
through telemedicine it includes all
 
06:00:48.230 --> 06:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
forms of telemedicine including audio
 
06:00:50.628 --> 06:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
only coverage
 
06:00:53.190 --> 06:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
um so what this bill does has adds a new
 
06:00:55.510 --> 06:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
section not to the telemedicine act but
 
06:00:57.990 --> 06:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
separately under under 415 so it's a
 
06:00:59.910 --> 06:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of an anomaly because it
 
06:01:01.270 --> 06:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
would be redundant in terms of the
 
06:01:03.190 --> 06:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
requirement at least as it relates to
 
06:01:04.948 --> 06:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
covering mental health care services and
 
06:01:06.948 --> 06:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
through telemedicine
 
06:01:09.270 --> 06:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
we also have very detailed network
 
06:01:11.350 --> 06:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
adequacy requirements in new hampshire
 
06:01:13.190 --> 06:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
we have a statute and a very detailed
 
06:01:15.190 --> 06:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
set of rules that stipulates time and
 
06:01:16.948 --> 06:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
distance standards that you must be able
 
06:01:19.510 --> 06:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
to access health care services to
 
06:01:21.350 --> 06:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
the insurance company can satisfy those
 
06:01:23.510 --> 06:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
network adequacy standards using
 
06:01:25.510 --> 06:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
telemedicine so if they have a health
 
06:01:27.350 --> 06:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
care provider whether it be in state or
 
06:01:28.628 --> 06:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
out of state that can perform the
 
06:01:30.708 --> 06:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
service through telemedicine the carrier
 
06:01:32.548 --> 06:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
can provide that locally to anybody who
 
06:01:34.548 --> 06:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
can get access through it so there is a
 
06:01:35.990 --> 06:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
natural incentive for an insurance
 
06:01:37.270 --> 06:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
company to look for where they can
 
06:01:40.150 --> 06:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
obtain care by an in-network provider
 
06:01:42.150 --> 06:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
using telemedicine and may even be a
 
06:01:44.070 --> 06:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
financial incentive since new hampshire
 
06:01:46.070 --> 06:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
has reimbursement parity with in-person
 
06:01:48.230 --> 06:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
visits you find an out-of-state provider
 
06:01:50.150 --> 06:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
where there is no in-person equivalent
 
06:01:51.910 --> 06:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's relatively open negotiation in
 
06:01:53.190 --> 06:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
terms of how much you might pay that
 
06:01:54.708 --> 06:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
health care provider
 
06:01:56.548 --> 06:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
so the actual bill just requires
 
06:01:58.470 --> 06:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
coverage of an out-of-network mental
 
06:02:00.310 --> 06:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
health care provider and so that's
 
06:02:01.590 --> 06:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
probably pretty easy for all our
 
06:02:04.070 --> 06:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to to satisfy
 
06:02:05.510 --> 06:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard it discussed including
 
06:02:07.270 --> 06:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
my sponsor but
 
06:02:08.868 --> 06:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
when i read the bill i thought
 
06:02:10.470 --> 06:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
they may actually be thinking about not
 
06:02:11.830 --> 06:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
just healthcare providers that are out
 
06:02:14.070 --> 06:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
of state but providers that are out of
 
06:02:14.080 --> 06:02:15.110 align:start position:0%
of state but providers that are out of
network

06:02:15.110 --> 06:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
network
 
06:02:18.390 --> 06:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
and that's a pretty loaded issue so even
 
06:02:20.708 --> 06:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
though it's limited to five patients
 
06:02:22.788 --> 06:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
there's not much detail there's not any
 
06:02:25.030 --> 06:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
detail in the bill about how you would
 
06:02:26.708 --> 06:02:26.718 align:start position:0%
resolve sort of how much that health
 
06:02:28.628 --> 06:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
care provider is going to be paid
 
06:02:30.708 --> 06:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
cost sharing protection to the patient
 
06:02:32.150 --> 06:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
not to have to pay more than cost
 
06:02:34.470 --> 06:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
sharing claims processing all of the
 
06:02:35.750 --> 06:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
sort of requirements that you would
 
06:02:37.270 --> 06:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
expect when you go to an in-network
 
06:02:39.270 --> 06:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
provider in new hampshire including new
 
06:02:40.788 --> 06:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire laws that are actually include
 
06:02:43.910 --> 06:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
provider contract standards so if you do
 
06:02:46.230 --> 06:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
intend to cover out-of-network providers
 
06:02:48.070 --> 06:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
in this capacity
 
06:02:49.830 --> 06:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
it would mean going through a number of
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
very controversial
 
06:02:53.270 --> 06:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
decisions because it does deal with
 
06:02:54.948 --> 06:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
payment levels and that means it's
 
06:02:56.150 --> 06:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
probably more of a bill that should go
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:01.830 --> 06:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
so i'll stick with the insurance and
 
06:03:03.270 --> 06:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
i'll end there happy to take any
 
06:03:07.590 --> 06:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:10.310 --> 06:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
06:03:14.070 --> 06:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:17.750 --> 06:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
is there likely to be pressure
 
06:03:20.310 --> 06:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
by the insurers to reduce rates of
 
06:03:20.320 --> 06:03:22.628 align:start position:0%
by the insurers to reduce rates of
reimbursement

06:03:22.628 --> 06:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
06:03:25.430 --> 06:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
um you mean very generally speaking is
 
06:03:27.590 --> 06:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
there is there going to be pressure yeah
 
06:03:27.600 --> 06:03:28.310 align:start position:0%
there is there going to be pressure yeah
there

06:03:28.310 --> 06:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:03:30.948 --> 06:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
there has been a lot of interest in
 
06:03:33.430 --> 06:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
research that shows savings when people
 
06:03:35.510 --> 06:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
access healthcare through telemedicine
 
06:03:36.788 --> 06:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
the insurers were not particularly
 
06:03:38.150 --> 06:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
interested in seeing the reimbursement
 
06:03:40.390 --> 06:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
parity legislation that passed but there
 
06:03:41.990 --> 06:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
is some evidence coming forward that
 
06:03:43.190 --> 06:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
when you access healthcare through
 
06:03:44.868 --> 06:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
telemedicine it can be more cost
 
06:03:46.628 --> 06:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
effective it can keep people out of the
 
06:03:49.110 --> 06:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
emergency department and so i think to
 
06:03:50.868 --> 06:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
the extent that an insurer is always
 
06:03:52.390 --> 06:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
looking for where they can get the most
 
06:03:54.548 --> 06:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
cost effective care that's going to
 
06:03:56.470 --> 06:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
continue to be their interest regardless
 
06:03:59.350 --> 06:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
what happens with this particular bill
 
06:04:00.868 --> 06:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
and maybe that answers the question you
 
06:04:00.878 --> 06:04:02.390 align:start position:0%
and maybe that answers the question you
have

06:04:02.390 --> 06:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:04:05.190 --> 06:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh in between the lines yes thank you
 
06:04:10.070 --> 06:04:10.080 align:start position:0%

um
 
06:04:46.628 --> 06:04:46.638 align:start position:0%
for as for as many um
 
06:04:48.150 --> 06:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
issues that we have i do support the
 
06:04:49.190 --> 06:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
06:04:50.868 --> 06:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation for several
 
06:04:50.878 --> 06:04:52.070 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation for several
reasons

06:04:52.070 --> 06:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
06:04:53.190 --> 06:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
i am
 
06:04:54.628 --> 06:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
increasingly receiving calls from
 
06:04:57.190 --> 06:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
constituents who are with great
 
06:04:59.910 --> 06:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
consternation expressing to me
 
06:05:02.548 --> 06:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
their concern over an interruption in
 
06:05:04.150 --> 06:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
their service
 
06:05:05.990 --> 06:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
whether it has been
 
06:05:06.000 --> 06:05:06.948 align:start position:0%
whether it has been
somebody

06:05:06.948 --> 06:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
06:05:09.110 --> 06:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
who has just recently relocated to the
 
06:05:09.120 --> 06:05:10.390 align:start position:0%
who has just recently relocated to the
state

06:05:10.390 --> 06:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:05:12.390 --> 06:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
and is then having to seek care
 
06:05:14.628 --> 06:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
and it's not um and i do understand the
 
06:05:17.030 --> 06:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
testimony before us behind us
 
06:05:19.030 --> 06:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh with respect with the extent with
 
06:05:20.708 --> 06:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
respect to the extensions
 
06:05:22.070 --> 06:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
that said
 
06:05:22.080 --> 06:05:24.070 align:start position:0%
that said
um

06:05:24.070 --> 06:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:26.150 --> 06:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
the communication that individuals are
 
06:05:28.150 --> 06:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
having from their health care providers
 
06:05:30.470 --> 06:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
has not been that and therefore i have
 
06:05:32.230 --> 06:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
been contacted
 
06:05:34.390 --> 06:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
um one of the other issues that i have
 
06:05:37.590 --> 06:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
been made aware of was that in addition
 
06:05:39.270 --> 06:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
to just
 
06:05:42.150 --> 06:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:44.230 --> 06:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
telehealth services
 
06:05:48.150 --> 06:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:49.990 --> 06:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
general health care services as well
 
06:05:51.190 --> 06:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
that were
 
06:05:53.110 --> 06:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
potentially going to be interrupted as a
 
06:05:54.548 --> 06:05:54.558 align:start position:0%
result that individuals would be
 
06:05:57.350 --> 06:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
participating remotely
 
06:06:00.150 --> 06:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
06:06:02.868 --> 06:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
where we go from here with this specific
 
06:06:04.948 --> 06:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation i don't know that
 
06:06:04.958 --> 06:06:05.590 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation i don't know that
is

06:06:05.590 --> 06:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:06:08.310 --> 06:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
under your purview but i would i would
 
06:06:09.670 --> 06:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
say that
 
06:06:09.680 --> 06:06:14.310 align:start position:0%
say that
um

06:06:14.310 --> 06:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:16.390 --> 06:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
the increasing concern that individuals
 
06:06:18.070 --> 06:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
seem to be having over the fact that
 
06:06:19.910 --> 06:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
their services could potentially be
 
06:06:22.868 --> 06:06:22.878 align:start position:0%
interrupted whether it's ending in
 
06:06:22.878 --> 06:06:23.990 align:start position:0%
interrupted whether it's ending in
january

06:06:23.990 --> 06:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
january
 
06:06:26.948 --> 06:06:26.958 align:start position:0%
or in may i think is problematic and so
 
06:06:28.070 --> 06:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
if this
 
06:06:29.990 --> 06:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
bill is not the vehicle then how else do
 
06:06:32.150 --> 06:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
we get there to make sure that we have
 
06:06:34.868 --> 06:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
continuity of care for individuals
 
06:06:36.948 --> 06:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
and aside from that i
 
06:06:39.030 --> 06:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
don't have anything else for you unless
 
06:06:42.708 --> 06:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:45.350 --> 06:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you so much thank you
 
06:06:47.270 --> 06:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
as i've been listening to the testimony
 
06:06:49.750 --> 06:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
i've come to two conclusions
 
06:06:52.150 --> 06:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
number one
 
06:06:55.270 --> 06:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
as the part-time ceo of a medical
 
06:06:57.030 --> 06:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
facility with three
 
06:06:59.510 --> 06:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
family practice providers i know very
 
06:06:59.520 --> 06:07:00.390 align:start position:0%
family practice providers i know very
well

06:07:00.390 --> 06:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:07:03.030 --> 06:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
the importance of this this is important
 
06:07:05.830 --> 06:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
stuff to a lot of people
 
06:07:08.070 --> 06:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
but the second conclusion i've come to
 
06:07:09.750 --> 06:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
is listening to
 
06:07:12.150 --> 06:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
the various people bringing testimony
 
06:07:14.708 --> 06:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
saying this reference needs to change
 
06:07:16.788 --> 06:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
this paragraph needs to go somewhere
 
06:07:19.990 --> 06:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
else this doesn't work here and so on
 
06:07:21.990 --> 06:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
we have two choices
 
06:07:23.910 --> 06:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
one is
 
06:07:26.230 --> 06:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
to appoint a subcommittee that is
 
06:07:28.270 --> 06:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
probably going to have to completely
 
06:07:32.070 --> 06:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
re-research and rewrite this bill
 
06:07:34.150 --> 06:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
you've heard all the reasons why
 
06:07:36.868 --> 06:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
or we're going to say to this primary
 
06:07:39.510 --> 06:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor and others
 
06:07:41.990 --> 06:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
great ideas now you heard the testimony
 
06:07:42.000 --> 06:07:42.948 align:start position:0%
great ideas now you heard the testimony
too

06:07:42.948 --> 06:07:42.958 align:start position:0%
too
 
06:07:46.310 --> 06:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
you go off and rewrite it and come back
 
06:07:48.868 --> 06:07:48.878 align:start position:0%
next year with something those really i
 
06:07:52.150 --> 06:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
don't see another choice in here so if
 
06:07:54.150 --> 06:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
there is sentiment i'm talking to the
 
06:07:56.390 --> 06:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee now um
 
06:07:58.470 --> 06:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
if there is sentiment for a group of you
 
06:08:00.070 --> 06:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
to rewrite the bill i'm not going to
 
06:08:01.910 --> 06:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
stand in your way
 
06:08:03.750 --> 06:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
but if there isn't there's the other
 
06:08:06.230 --> 06:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
choice representative shapiro and then
 
06:08:06.240 --> 06:08:07.430 align:start position:0%
choice representative shapiro and then
canark

06:08:07.430 --> 06:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
canark
 
06:08:09.350 --> 06:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
i think there is one other alternative
 
06:08:13.430 --> 06:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:16.310 --> 06:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
the director of olpc
 
06:08:18.948 --> 06:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
referenced several senate bills that
 
06:08:21.670 --> 06:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
were going to extend
 
06:08:23.430 --> 06:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
temporary licenses
 
06:08:23.440 --> 06:08:24.470 align:start position:0%
temporary licenses
and

06:08:24.470 --> 06:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:26.310 --> 06:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
people could get on board with working
 
06:08:27.830 --> 06:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
on one of those bills i think she
 
06:08:30.948 --> 06:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
referenced two or three of those bills
 
06:08:32.548 --> 06:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:08:34.708 --> 06:08:34.718 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor are you aware of those
 
06:08:36.070 --> 06:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
senate bills
 
06:08:37.030 --> 06:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
06:08:39.110 --> 06:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
do you think those would be the kind of
 
06:08:42.470 --> 06:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles yeah come on up this is
 
06:08:47.110 --> 06:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:49.750 --> 06:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
um yes i i think as a school of fish
 
06:08:52.070 --> 06:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
whatever bakes it right
 
06:08:52.080 --> 06:08:52.868 align:start position:0%
whatever bakes it right
sure

06:08:52.868 --> 06:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
sure
 
06:08:56.310 --> 06:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
yeah um representative canark is next uh
 
06:08:59.270 --> 06:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
yes sb 277 is one that just extends it
 
06:09:01.830 --> 06:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
for two years automatically and it would
 
06:09:04.070 --> 06:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
seem to me that if we put our i mean
 
06:09:05.670 --> 06:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
we've done this often where we have two
 
06:09:07.030 --> 06:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
bills and one of them is going to be a
 
06:09:09.110 --> 06:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
better solution coming out of the senate
 
06:09:11.510 --> 06:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
that will give a longer horizon doesn't
 
06:09:13.910 --> 06:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
set up all of the difficulties of having
 
06:09:15.590 --> 06:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
to declare an emergency that may go on
 
06:09:16.868 --> 06:09:16.878 align:start position:0%
forever anyway
 
06:09:19.590 --> 06:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
and um automatically just gives us the
 
06:09:22.070 --> 06:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
two years to keep working on this uh so
 
06:09:23.750 --> 06:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
i would think that may be a better
 
06:09:25.510 --> 06:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
solution overall not that i don't like
 
06:09:27.430 --> 06:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
the idea it's just it may be a more
 
06:09:29.110 --> 06:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
workable solution
 
06:09:30.868 --> 06:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
we want to do the best for all the
 
06:09:33.190 --> 06:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
caring and hard work you've done to get
 
06:09:35.910 --> 06:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
something along representative soloway
 
06:09:38.150 --> 06:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman taking a page out
 
06:09:40.230 --> 06:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
of representative wood's playbook i'd
 
06:09:44.230 --> 06:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
like to go to the 30 000 foot uh view
 
06:09:44.240 --> 06:09:45.430 align:start position:0%
like to go to the 30 000 foot uh view
um

06:09:45.430 --> 06:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:49.110 --> 06:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
and as we operate one of the things that
 
06:09:51.910 --> 06:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh we have a principle we've operated on
 
06:09:53.270 --> 06:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
for the years that i've been on this
 
06:09:54.910 --> 06:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
committee is it is not our
 
06:09:54.920 --> 06:09:56.708 align:start position:0%
committee is it is not our
responsibility

06:09:56.708 --> 06:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
06:09:58.310 --> 06:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
to rewrite
 
06:09:58.320 --> 06:10:00.548 align:start position:0%
to rewrite
legislation

06:10:00.548 --> 06:10:00.558 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:10:04.230 --> 06:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
if the proponent of legislation cares to
 
06:10:06.070 --> 06:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
suggest amendments if members of the
 
06:10:07.110 --> 06:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
committee wish to come in with
 
06:10:09.830 --> 06:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
amendments but rewriting legislation is
 
06:10:12.708 --> 06:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
not our job and as you indicated earlier
 
06:10:14.868 --> 06:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
when you brought this subject up it is
 
06:10:19.670 --> 06:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
always the prerogative of the uh
 
06:10:19.680 --> 06:10:20.788 align:start position:0%
always the prerogative of the uh
initial

06:10:20.788 --> 06:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
initial
 
06:10:23.270 --> 06:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
provider of the bill to rewrite it for
 
06:10:25.190 --> 06:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
next year and i would like to suggest
 
06:10:28.310 --> 06:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
that we take a very conservative view of
 
06:10:31.430 --> 06:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
our role in rewriting legislation we
 
06:10:33.750 --> 06:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
already have an excessive workload thank
 
06:10:35.750 --> 06:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman representative it always
 
06:10:37.590 --> 06:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
warms my heart when i hear you use the
 
06:10:41.990 --> 06:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:44.390 --> 06:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
06:10:44.400 --> 06:10:45.750 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
chairman

06:10:45.750 --> 06:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:10:47.910 --> 06:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 330 was also mentioned and
 
06:10:49.750 --> 06:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
that one was actually a request of the
 
06:10:51.910 --> 06:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
office the professional licensure and
 
06:10:54.548 --> 06:10:54.558 align:start position:0%
certification so i i think your idea was
 
06:10:56.788 --> 06:10:56.798 align:start position:0%
shared by many and i think maybe we
 
06:10:58.230 --> 06:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
should let the senate run with the ball
 
06:11:00.830 --> 06:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
on this one and then send it to us in my
 
06:11:00.840 --> 06:11:02.788 align:start position:0%
on this one and then send it to us in my
opinion

06:11:02.788 --> 06:11:02.798 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
06:11:04.390 --> 06:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
06:11:06.628 --> 06:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
now thank you just a question for the
 
06:11:08.708 --> 06:11:08.718 align:start position:0%
all the sponsors and co-sponsors are you
 
06:11:10.150 --> 06:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
working with the commission on
 
06:11:10.160 --> 06:11:11.430 align:start position:0%
working with the commission on
telehealth

06:11:11.430 --> 06:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
telehealth
 
06:11:14.788 --> 06:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
um that's active and it's
 
06:11:17.110 --> 06:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
doing a much of the same sort of
 
06:11:17.120 --> 06:11:18.390 align:start position:0%
doing a much of the same sort of
processing

06:11:18.390 --> 06:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
processing
 
06:11:19.910 --> 06:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question we've
 
06:11:22.150 --> 06:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
been working mostly with nami
 
06:11:24.868 --> 06:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
um and again uh
 
06:11:26.230 --> 06:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
we've been
 
06:11:28.070 --> 06:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
we've been doing the best we can
 
06:11:30.548 --> 06:11:30.558 align:start position:0%
and i just want to i don't know if it's
 
06:11:32.230 --> 06:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate since it sounds like you
 
06:11:33.990 --> 06:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
guys are kind of an executive session
 
06:11:35.350 --> 06:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
right now well you know we were
 
06:11:37.190 --> 06:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
wondering that up here okay
 
06:11:39.830 --> 06:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
we're technically not we're lurching
 
06:11:42.310 --> 06:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
towards it okay i just want to say on
 
06:11:44.548 --> 06:11:44.558 align:start position:0%
the record for every single committee in
 
06:11:46.868 --> 06:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
this body and with all due respect to
 
06:11:48.948 --> 06:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
representative soloway i think it's
 
06:11:51.750 --> 06:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
entirely inappropriate to kill a bill
 
06:11:53.670 --> 06:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
just because it's not perfect when you
 
06:11:56.868 --> 06:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
hear an intent that is really needed and
 
06:11:59.510 --> 06:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
when you have an over surmounting amount
 
06:12:01.750 --> 06:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
of constituents in a life or death
 
06:12:04.230 --> 06:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
situation to not at least give it the
 
06:12:07.190 --> 06:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
old college try
 
06:12:07.200 --> 06:12:09.030 align:start position:0%
old college try
representative

06:12:09.030 --> 06:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:12:15.110 --> 06:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:17.350 --> 06:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
06:12:19.430 --> 06:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
my hearing aids are running out now it
 
06:12:21.190 --> 06:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
is oh it's good
 
06:12:23.750 --> 06:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
06:12:26.310 --> 06:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
i'm bothered by the fact that and this
 
06:12:28.390 --> 06:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
raises a question in my mind about how
 
06:12:30.628 --> 06:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
to move forward but i received two
 
06:12:32.470 --> 06:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
emails from members of the board of
 
06:12:34.868 --> 06:12:34.878 align:start position:0%
licensure just recently one from the
 
06:12:37.190 --> 06:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
chair and one from someone else and each
 
06:12:38.788 --> 06:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
time we've considered changes in
 
06:12:41.350 --> 06:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
licensure nobody from that board ever
 
06:12:42.628 --> 06:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
shows up
 
06:12:45.270 --> 06:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
to give their point of view and yet they
 
06:12:47.430 --> 06:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
oppose all these bills
 
06:12:48.788 --> 06:12:48.798 align:start position:0%
i think if they can't make a
 
06:12:50.470 --> 06:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
contribution and they have a strong
 
06:12:52.390 --> 06:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
opinion about this we ought to hear
 
06:12:54.548 --> 06:12:54.558 align:start position:0%
about it before we try to redraft or do
 
06:12:56.708 --> 06:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
anything to avail i apologize to this
 
06:12:59.110 --> 06:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
woman that she got very little help from
 
06:13:01.190 --> 06:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
them but i think at least we ought to
 
06:13:03.350 --> 06:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
pass the information along to the senate
 
06:13:05.350 --> 06:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
that we receive no assistance from this
 
06:13:07.830 --> 06:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
board and that we think i think either
 
06:13:09.430 --> 06:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
of those that would extend it in some
 
06:13:11.830 --> 06:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
other way either for the two years or as
 
06:13:14.628 --> 06:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
as he said to the give the board of the
 
06:13:16.470 --> 06:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
board of relationships
 
06:13:18.628 --> 06:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
really go ahead but if they can't even
 
06:13:20.708 --> 06:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
come in here and let us know why they so
 
06:13:23.350 --> 06:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
strongly object to this bill i don't
 
06:13:25.190 --> 06:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
feel we need to take any
 
06:13:26.868 --> 06:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
06:13:29.030 --> 06:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
kanark sorry it just took me a moment to
 
06:13:31.750 --> 06:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
find it but uh sb 277 did pass out a
 
06:13:34.390 --> 06:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
committee six to zero ought to pass
 
06:13:35.990 --> 06:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
so i think there's a high probability we
 
06:13:38.708 --> 06:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
do you like this bill that senate bill
 
06:13:41.350 --> 06:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
yeah but i would think we could perhaps
 
06:13:43.350 --> 06:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
also given the may 31
 
06:13:45.350 --> 06:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
expiration date perhaps we could ask
 
06:13:47.270 --> 06:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
that the senate would expedite this over
 
06:13:48.708 --> 06:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
to us and we should act upon it the
 
06:13:51.510 --> 06:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
house very rapidly speak to your
 
06:13:53.350 --> 06:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
higher-ups in your party see what they
 
06:13:55.510 --> 06:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
can do and i'll run to the speaker too
 
06:13:55.520 --> 06:13:56.470 align:start position:0%
can do and i'll run to the speaker too
um

06:13:56.470 --> 06:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:58.230 --> 06:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
well being a republican bill i thought
 
06:13:59.830 --> 06:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
maybe you might uh speak to your
 
06:14:01.590 --> 06:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
higher-ups instead
 
06:14:06.868 --> 06:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:08.868 --> 06:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
it did have just about every senator on
 
06:14:08.878 --> 06:14:09.670 align:start position:0%
it did have just about every senator on
it

06:14:09.670 --> 06:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:14:11.990 --> 06:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
just about every senator uh
 
06:14:14.788 --> 06:14:14.798 align:start position:0%
sponsored this bill
 
06:14:17.030 --> 06:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
06:14:19.910 --> 06:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you mr
 
06:14:22.310 --> 06:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
sorry representative conner um help me
 
06:14:23.590 --> 06:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
understand because i'm trying to find
 
06:14:25.270 --> 06:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
out on that bill
 
06:14:26.628 --> 06:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
it looked like it went to the house
 
06:14:27.990 --> 06:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
06:14:30.150 --> 06:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
my concern is that if it crosses over to
 
06:14:31.750 --> 06:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
the house
 
06:14:33.750 --> 06:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
is that it comes to this committee and i
 
06:14:36.628 --> 06:14:36.638 align:start position:0%
go into either eda edna
 
06:14:38.150 --> 06:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
or some other committee because it seems
 
06:14:40.310 --> 06:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
like a lot of the expertise is here
 
06:14:42.470 --> 06:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
and not in other committees in the house
 
06:14:44.230 --> 06:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
so do you know where it actually started
 
06:14:46.230 --> 06:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
06:14:48.310 --> 06:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's um i'm sorry let me i should be
 
06:14:49.430 --> 06:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
should be able to say
 
06:14:50.548 --> 06:14:50.558 align:start position:0%
anybody know
 
06:14:53.590 --> 06:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
it went to finance in the senate
 
06:14:55.670 --> 06:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
it went to finance and senate so it came
 
06:14:57.350 --> 06:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
out of the finance
 
06:14:57.360 --> 06:14:58.230 align:start position:0%
out of the finance
there

06:14:58.230 --> 06:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:14:59.430 --> 06:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know what department he would
 
06:15:00.868 --> 06:15:00.878 align:start position:0%
come to here
 
06:15:02.548 --> 06:15:02.558 align:start position:0%
obviously so mr
 
06:15:04.310 --> 06:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i guess the question to you
 
06:15:07.510 --> 06:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
is the leader of our committee how can
 
06:15:09.750 --> 06:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
we somehow work with the
 
06:15:11.350 --> 06:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
leadership and the house to have that
 
06:15:15.830 --> 06:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:18.470 --> 06:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
well as they said it's my party so i got
 
06:15:19.750 --> 06:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
06:15:22.070 --> 06:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
um what i would suggest
 
06:15:24.470 --> 06:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
yeah please just the thing is licensure
 
06:15:27.030 --> 06:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
issues are usually
 
06:15:30.070 --> 06:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
our plc and that goes to edna eddie so i
 
06:15:31.190 --> 06:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
would think actually it would probably
 
06:15:33.190 --> 06:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate in edna than us even
 
06:15:35.030 --> 06:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
though we have the technical
 
06:15:36.948 --> 06:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
the health expertise
 
06:15:38.788 --> 06:15:38.798 align:start position:0%
but it might go might be a two committee
 
06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
bill i'm not give it to the other
 
06:15:43.190 --> 06:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative pearson i like that
 
06:15:44.708 --> 06:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
he's on edna
 
06:15:47.830 --> 06:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh let me suggest this that um
 
06:15:49.910 --> 06:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have to decide this right now
 
06:15:52.708 --> 06:15:52.718 align:start position:0%
can we um you know chew on this for a
 
06:15:55.030 --> 06:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
week or so and see what we can do with
 
06:15:56.948 --> 06:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
the senate and you've got some ideas and
 
06:15:59.430 --> 06:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
you know i i mean we're most of us are
 
06:16:01.510 --> 06:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
fixits here we like to make things
 
06:16:03.750 --> 06:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
really good although i do really
 
06:16:05.990 --> 06:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the two-year extension
 
06:16:08.310 --> 06:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
just like the last extension
 
06:16:11.030 --> 06:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
was january 31st per the government
 
06:16:13.910 --> 06:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
governor's executive order and now
 
06:16:16.788 --> 06:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
there's another extension to may 31st
 
06:16:19.190 --> 06:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
that all providers aren't really being
 
06:16:20.628 --> 06:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
made aware of and they're dropping
 
06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
patients already and so to allow this
 
06:16:26.390 --> 06:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
body the responsibility to continue to
 
06:16:29.750 --> 06:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
kick the can down the road in language
 
06:16:31.030 --> 06:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
is i think
 
06:16:33.350 --> 06:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
really irresponsible of us
 
06:16:35.510 --> 06:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
well the problem is that you heard all
 
06:16:36.788 --> 06:16:36.798 align:start position:0%
of the different
 
06:16:38.868 --> 06:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
this needs to be changed and that is in
 
06:16:40.628 --> 06:16:40.638 align:start position:0%
the wrong spot and so on it's a lot of
 
06:16:42.628 --> 06:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
work to you know to get this one up to
 
06:16:44.150 --> 06:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
speed here
 
06:16:46.150 --> 06:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
i think all of your work notwithstanding
 
06:16:48.470 --> 06:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
i understand and i appreciate all the
 
06:16:50.390 --> 06:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
work and unfortunately i think that's
 
06:16:52.628 --> 06:16:52.638 align:start position:0%
what we signed up for
 
06:16:54.470 --> 06:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's why we get the big bucks okay
 
06:16:56.628 --> 06:16:56.638 align:start position:0%
with that i'm going to close the hearing
 
06:16:59.430 --> 06:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
on 1405 and take a five-minute mental
 
06:17:01.910 --> 06:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
health break
 
06:17:43.430 --> 06:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:53.270 --> 06:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:53.280 --> 06:18:03.510 align:start position:0%

06:29:35.510 --> 06:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
have been struggling with workforce
 
06:29:37.430 --> 06:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
shortages for years but the last two
 
06:29:40.628 --> 06:29:40.638 align:start position:0%
years have been even more challenging
 
06:29:42.708 --> 06:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
in part due to the pandemic
 
06:29:45.190 --> 06:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
the process to get healthcare clinicians
 
06:29:47.430 --> 06:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
licensed is time-consuming and is
 
06:29:50.230 --> 06:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
further delayed by the criminal backed
 
06:29:51.510 --> 06:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
background check
 
06:29:54.070 --> 06:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
process the department of safety has
 
06:29:56.948 --> 06:29:56.958 align:start position:0%
done a terrific job recently opening a
 
06:29:59.030 --> 06:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
portal for state criminal background
 
06:30:01.510 --> 06:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
checks for anyone however
 
06:30:03.670 --> 06:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
the health care facilities must have
 
06:30:05.990 --> 06:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
national fbi
 
06:30:08.150 --> 06:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
backed as well as state background
 
06:30:11.270 --> 06:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
checks the department of safety portal
 
06:30:13.510 --> 06:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
only does new hampshire criminal
 
06:30:15.270 --> 06:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
06:30:17.030 --> 06:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
this would this bill would allow the
 
06:30:19.030 --> 06:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
health care facilities to utilize a
 
06:30:20.628 --> 06:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
third party vendor to complete the
 
06:30:22.628 --> 06:30:22.638 align:start position:0%
federal background check
 
06:30:25.110 --> 06:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
which is requirement of of health care
 
06:30:28.868 --> 06:30:28.878 align:start position:0%
facilities licensing under rsa 151 colon
 
06:30:28.878 --> 06:30:31.190 align:start position:0%
facilities licensing under rsa 151 colon

06:30:31.190 --> 06:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
2-d
 
06:30:31.200 --> 06:30:32.230 align:start position:0%
2-d
these

06:30:32.230 --> 06:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
these
 
06:30:35.270 --> 06:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
these third-party vendors can both
 
06:30:37.510 --> 06:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
can do both federal and state checks in
 
06:30:39.510 --> 06:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
one process
 
06:30:41.990 --> 06:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
the bill does not preclude a facility
 
06:30:44.548 --> 06:30:44.558 align:start position:0%
from using the new hampshire department
 
06:30:45.670 --> 06:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
of safety
 
06:30:48.150 --> 06:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
it just gives the facilities an option
 
06:30:50.548 --> 06:30:50.558 align:start position:0%
to use whoever they choose
 
06:30:51.670 --> 06:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:30:53.910 --> 06:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
whichever is most expedient
 
06:30:55.830 --> 06:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
this bill does not eliminate the
 
06:30:55.840 --> 06:30:57.030 align:start position:0%
this bill does not eliminate the
requirement

06:30:57.030 --> 06:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
06:30:58.628 --> 06:30:58.638 align:start position:0%
of health care facilities to complete
 
06:31:00.468 --> 06:31:00.478 align:start position:0%
the criminal background check for all
 
06:31:00.478 --> 06:31:01.670 align:start position:0%
the criminal background check for all
employees

06:31:01.670 --> 06:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
employees
 
06:31:03.750 --> 06:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
it just removes the language in health
 
06:31:06.310 --> 06:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
facilities licensing statute to obtain
 
06:31:08.310 --> 06:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
the criminal background checks results
 
06:31:10.948 --> 06:31:10.958 align:start position:0%
from the department of safety only
 
06:31:12.868 --> 06:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
this small change
 
06:31:14.548 --> 06:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
will expedite the ability of these
 
06:31:16.788 --> 06:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
facilities to get health care clinicians
 
06:31:19.270 --> 06:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
on the job helping their patients in a
 
06:31:22.468 --> 06:31:22.478 align:start position:0%
more expedited fashion
 
06:31:24.548 --> 06:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
06:31:26.230 --> 06:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
there will be representatives from the
 
06:31:29.510 --> 06:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire healthcare association and
 
06:31:30.548 --> 06:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:31:32.468 --> 06:31:32.478 align:start position:0%
hospital association who will be
 
06:31:34.548 --> 06:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
testifying on this bell
 
06:31:36.390 --> 06:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
and they are willing to come up together
 
06:31:38.390 --> 06:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
and do this to hopefully answer your
 
06:31:40.868 --> 06:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
questions all at the same time
 
06:31:42.948 --> 06:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
matter of fact i would probably defer
 
06:31:44.788 --> 06:31:44.798 align:start position:0%
questions be asked to them because that
 
06:31:46.548 --> 06:31:46.558 align:start position:0%
will save even more time
 
06:31:48.310 --> 06:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you both for your
 
06:31:51.750 --> 06:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:54.230 --> 06:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
chair calls theresa rosenberger and
 
06:31:59.910 --> 06:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:04.788 --> 06:32:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:06.948 --> 06:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
i just want you to remember i have 37
 
06:32:13.590 --> 06:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:15.750 --> 06:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
with that i'll start while she's passing
 
06:32:17.750 --> 06:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
out onto teresa rosenberger
 
06:32:19.430 --> 06:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien that was left
 
06:32:22.628 --> 06:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:24.548 --> 06:32:24.558 align:start position:0%
when she had two minutes to speak and
 
06:32:27.270 --> 06:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
she was 37 seconds to the good so she
 
06:32:39.590 --> 06:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:41.270 --> 06:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm theresa rasenberger from
 
06:32:43.190 --> 06:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
bernstein shure and i'm here today on
 
06:32:44.788 --> 06:32:44.798 align:start position:0%
behalf of the new hampshire new
 
06:32:46.948 --> 06:32:46.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire healthcare association nursing
 
06:32:49.750 --> 06:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
homes and we had
 
06:32:52.390 --> 06:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
um specifically asked representative
 
06:32:55.430 --> 06:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
abrami to put his bill in and it's okay
 
06:32:57.750 --> 06:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
i'll talk quickly then we'll let paula
 
06:33:00.468 --> 06:33:00.478 align:start position:0%
of the hospital association speak um
 
06:33:02.310 --> 06:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
there was a bill a law that was passed
 
06:33:05.270 --> 06:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
in 2017.
 
06:33:07.350 --> 06:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
06:33:09.990 --> 06:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh in 2017
 
06:33:12.310 --> 06:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
we believe it or not did have staffing
 
06:33:14.230 --> 06:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
shortages in the nursing homes
 
06:33:16.628 --> 06:33:16.638 align:start position:0%
particularly with lna's licensed nursing
 
06:33:20.150 --> 06:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
assistants so in 17 the um
 
06:33:22.548 --> 06:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
healthcare association put in a piece of
 
06:33:22.558 --> 06:33:23.910 align:start position:0%
healthcare association put in a piece of
legislation

06:33:23.910 --> 06:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:33:26.310 --> 06:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
that allowed
 
06:33:29.030 --> 06:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
folks who had gone to school and were
 
06:33:31.270 --> 06:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
waiting for their licensing
 
06:33:33.990 --> 06:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
as an lna and had been hired by a
 
06:33:37.590 --> 06:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
facility to actually work temporarily
 
06:33:39.350 --> 06:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
for 90 days
 
06:33:41.670 --> 06:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
while they were awaiting the licensing i
 
06:33:43.270 --> 06:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
mean excuse me the criminal background
 
06:33:45.510 --> 06:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
check it was taking
 
06:33:47.910 --> 06:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
almost 90 days at that time to get a
 
06:33:49.990 --> 06:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
check there was a staffing issue and
 
06:33:51.910 --> 06:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the legislation they had
 
06:33:54.390 --> 06:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
to be under the supervision of a
 
06:33:57.350 --> 06:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
licensed provider et cetera et cetera
 
06:34:00.788 --> 06:34:00.798 align:start position:0%
so that bill passed in 17
 
06:34:02.948 --> 06:34:02.958 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst to well i shouldn't say
 
06:34:05.190 --> 06:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
anyone knows my client but my client
 
06:34:07.270 --> 06:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
called me up this year and kind of said
 
06:34:09.110 --> 06:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
what gives the state all of a sudden
 
06:34:12.070 --> 06:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
start stopped allowing the 90-day
 
06:34:12.080 --> 06:34:13.990 align:start position:0%
start stopped allowing the 90-day
temporary

06:34:13.990 --> 06:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
06:34:15.990 --> 06:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
licensure for people waiting for their
 
06:34:18.468 --> 06:34:18.478 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks lnas and i
 
06:34:19.910 --> 06:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
said well the state can't just do that
 
06:34:21.990 --> 06:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
he said they did so i looked at the law
 
06:34:24.628 --> 06:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
and guess what it was repealed
 
06:34:28.310 --> 06:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
in 2019 and i think at the time bob dunn
 
06:34:30.708 --> 06:34:30.718 align:start position:0%
was working for the nursing home homes
 
06:34:32.948 --> 06:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
at that point i think they truly believe
 
06:34:35.510 --> 06:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
by 19 the state and the department's
 
06:34:37.350 --> 06:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
safety would have their portal up for
 
06:34:39.190 --> 06:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks and this
 
06:34:41.030 --> 06:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be an issue
 
06:34:42.548 --> 06:34:42.558 align:start position:0%
it repealed
 
06:34:45.510 --> 06:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
we have the pandemic and as you all know
 
06:34:48.070 --> 06:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
the situation is far worse than it was
 
06:34:48.080 --> 06:34:48.830 align:start position:0%
the situation is far worse than it was
in

06:34:48.830 --> 06:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:34:52.468 --> 06:34:52.478 align:start position:0%
2017. when the legislation was put forth
 
06:34:55.830 --> 06:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
so what we did is we literally put
 
06:34:59.590 --> 06:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
exactly the same language in as was in
 
06:35:02.628 --> 06:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
the statute in 2017
 
06:35:05.190 --> 06:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
and then my friend paula manahan calls
 
06:35:07.990 --> 06:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
me up and says hey can i jump under your
 
06:35:08.000 --> 06:35:09.030 align:start position:0%
me up and says hey can i jump under your
bill

06:35:09.030 --> 06:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:35:12.070 --> 06:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
for hospitals and in full disclosure i
 
06:35:14.548 --> 06:35:14.558 align:start position:0%
also represent north country health
 
06:35:17.270 --> 06:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
which are the critical assets hospitals
 
06:35:20.468 --> 06:35:20.478 align:start position:0%
in the north country and so
 
06:35:22.070 --> 06:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
we talked about it
 
06:35:24.708 --> 06:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
and i said sure you can you can jump on
 
06:35:26.230 --> 06:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
and we asked representative romney if it
 
06:35:28.070 --> 06:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
would be all right because they have
 
06:35:30.230 --> 06:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
some of the same situation
 
06:35:33.270 --> 06:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
we are not in any way asking that there
 
06:35:35.430 --> 06:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
not be criminal background checks
 
06:35:37.830 --> 06:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
we fully believe there should be state
 
06:35:39.990 --> 06:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
and federal we're just asking to
 
06:35:43.190 --> 06:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
expedite the process right now if you
 
06:35:43.200 --> 06:35:43.990 align:start position:0%
expedite the process right now if you
are

06:35:43.990 --> 06:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:35:45.750 --> 06:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
hoping to be an lna
 
06:35:47.670 --> 06:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
you have to have a state criminal
 
06:35:50.310 --> 06:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
background check to attend school
 
06:35:52.548 --> 06:35:52.558 align:start position:0%
after you finish your schooling you have
 
06:35:55.190 --> 06:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
to have a state and federal background
 
06:35:57.910 --> 06:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
check in order to get a license as an
 
06:35:57.920 --> 06:35:58.948 align:start position:0%
check in order to get a license as an
lna

06:35:58.948 --> 06:35:58.958 align:start position:0%
lna
 
06:36:01.190 --> 06:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
and if
 
06:36:03.750 --> 06:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
one of my nursing homes hires you you
 
06:36:05.670 --> 06:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
also have to have an additional state
 
06:36:07.590 --> 06:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
and federal
 
06:36:07.600 --> 06:36:08.548 align:start position:0%
and federal
federal

06:36:08.548 --> 06:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
federal
 
06:36:10.230 --> 06:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
criminal background check and as you see
 
06:36:11.830 --> 06:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
in the legislation
 
06:36:14.548 --> 06:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
it specifically references department of
 
06:36:14.558 --> 06:36:15.590 align:start position:0%
it specifically references department of
safety

06:36:15.590 --> 06:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
safety
 
06:36:17.750 --> 06:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we will be the first to say they
 
06:36:19.830 --> 06:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
have done an unbelievable job with this
 
06:36:22.548 --> 06:36:22.558 align:start position:0%
new portal that it was just recently
 
06:36:24.150 --> 06:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
opened we met with them this summer and
 
06:36:25.750 --> 06:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
up and this fall
 
06:36:28.390 --> 06:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
everybody says it's dynamite and it is
 
06:36:31.590 --> 06:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it only does a state check
 
06:36:33.430 --> 06:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't do the federal
 
06:36:35.670 --> 06:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
so right now if you want to be in lna
 
06:36:37.830 --> 06:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
and work in a nursing home you still got
 
06:36:40.310 --> 06:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
to go through three checks two of which
 
06:36:43.110 --> 06:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
have to be federal so we're just asking
 
06:36:43.120 --> 06:36:44.230 align:start position:0%
have to be federal so we're just asking
that

06:36:44.230 --> 06:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:36:46.230 --> 06:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
that language that says department of
 
06:36:48.070 --> 06:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
safety be removed if you want to go to
 
06:36:50.230 --> 06:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
safety you can and if you want to go to
 
06:36:51.910 --> 06:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
a third party but you've got to have the
 
06:36:53.510 --> 06:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
checks it's the bottom line you've got
 
06:36:55.030 --> 06:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
to have a state check
 
06:36:57.430 --> 06:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
and the state and federal check so paula
 
06:37:00.390 --> 06:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's all yours thank you teresa
 
06:37:02.948 --> 06:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
and again for the record my name is
 
06:37:04.468 --> 06:37:04.478 align:start position:0%
paula minihan
 
06:37:05.910 --> 06:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
senior vice president state government
 
06:37:07.270 --> 06:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
relations for the new hampshire hospital
 
06:37:09.548 --> 06:37:09.558 align:start position:0%
association we are in strong support of
 
06:37:12.070 --> 06:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
1659 and we do thank the sponsor
 
06:37:14.150 --> 06:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative obrami
 
06:37:15.830 --> 06:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
and all the co-sponsors including a
 
06:37:16.788 --> 06:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
couple that are sitting on this
 
06:37:19.030 --> 06:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
committee for agreeing to sponsor this
 
06:37:21.750 --> 06:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
legislation it is very important as
 
06:37:24.948 --> 06:37:24.958 align:start position:0%
representative obrami articulated what
 
06:37:26.070 --> 06:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
it does
 
06:37:29.350 --> 06:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
and teresa's right when i saw the lsr i
 
06:37:29.360 --> 06:37:30.708 align:start position:0%
and teresa's right when i saw the lsr i
immediately

06:37:30.708 --> 06:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
06:37:32.788 --> 06:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
reached out to representative abrami and
 
06:37:34.390 --> 06:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
found out
 
06:37:35.990 --> 06:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
that the healthcare association had put
 
06:37:38.150 --> 06:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
this in i reached out to teresa and then
 
06:37:40.230 --> 06:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
we started working together so there are
 
06:37:42.468 --> 06:37:42.478 align:start position:0%
two components of this bill but as she
 
06:37:42.478 --> 06:37:43.270 align:start position:0%
two components of this bill but as she
said

06:37:43.270 --> 06:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
said
 
06:37:45.510 --> 06:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
um it helps health care facilities in
 
06:37:48.628 --> 06:37:48.638 align:start position:0%
general but the hospitals specifically
 
06:37:50.548 --> 06:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
we have heard through
 
06:37:53.190 --> 06:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
working with our hr folks um for years
 
06:37:56.548 --> 06:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
that they use often um a third party and
 
06:37:59.350 --> 06:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
pt research is an example um that they
 
06:38:01.830 --> 06:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
have used for years um so what happens
 
06:38:04.150 --> 06:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
is because of the way the language the
 
06:38:06.548 --> 06:38:06.558 align:start position:0%
current statute specifically states
 
06:38:08.150 --> 06:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
department of safety you have to go
 
06:38:10.070 --> 06:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
through the department of safety
 
06:38:11.990 --> 06:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
and they use as a condition of
 
06:38:14.468 --> 06:38:14.478 align:start position:0%
employment a they have to do their own
 
06:38:16.788 --> 06:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
um checks and so they go through they
 
06:38:19.990 --> 06:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
you they pay for through the third party
 
06:38:22.628 --> 06:38:22.638 align:start position:0%
another fbi check so it's duplicative
 
06:38:25.230 --> 06:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
it's expensive it's um
 
06:38:29.270 --> 06:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and um and time consuming so
 
06:38:32.310 --> 06:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
by taking those words out again it's um
 
06:38:34.708 --> 06:38:34.718 align:start position:0%
it allows it's silent on whether or not
 
06:38:36.708 --> 06:38:36.718 align:start position:0%
you use department of safety as teresa
 
06:38:38.868 --> 06:38:38.878 align:start position:0%
said so it doesn't prohibit anyone from
 
06:38:40.070 --> 06:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
using them but
 
06:38:42.868 --> 06:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
it gives some flexibility and
 
06:38:44.788 --> 06:38:44.798 align:start position:0%
this is a very important bill for our
 
06:38:44.798 --> 06:38:45.830 align:start position:0%
this is a very important bill for our
members

06:38:45.830 --> 06:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
members
 
06:38:49.190 --> 06:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
and um we again are very appreciative of
 
06:38:51.110 --> 06:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
um representative obrami and all the
 
06:38:52.708 --> 06:38:52.718 align:start position:0%
sponsors um
 
06:38:54.788 --> 06:38:54.798 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
06:38:57.430 --> 06:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
but that's it's a pretty i that's pretty
 
06:38:58.868 --> 06:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
much um
 
06:39:00.390 --> 06:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
exactly what it does
 
06:39:03.590 --> 06:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
i have a question on page 1 line 29
 
06:39:05.830 --> 06:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
under the direct
 
06:39:08.868 --> 06:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
supervision would you define how direct
 
06:39:11.830 --> 06:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
direct supervision is here
 
06:39:11.840 --> 06:39:13.510 align:start position:0%
direct supervision is here
[Music]

06:39:13.510 --> 06:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:39:15.670 --> 06:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
well in a nursing home direct
 
06:39:18.310 --> 06:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
supervision we have a myriad of
 
06:39:18.320 --> 06:39:19.590 align:start position:0%
supervision we have a myriad of
different

06:39:19.590 --> 06:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:39:19.600 --> 06:39:20.708 align:start position:0%
different
licensed

06:39:20.708 --> 06:39:20.718 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
06:39:23.270 --> 06:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
categories of so
 
06:39:25.670 --> 06:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
in this case because these nurses are
 
06:39:25.680 --> 06:39:26.788 align:start position:0%
in this case because these nurses are
not

06:39:26.788 --> 06:39:26.798 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:39:28.948 --> 06:39:28.958 align:start position:0%
permanently like these lnas are not
 
06:39:30.548 --> 06:39:30.558 align:start position:0%
permanently licensed they're working
 
06:39:32.468 --> 06:39:32.478 align:start position:0%
under under a nurse and a registered
 
06:39:32.478 --> 06:39:33.670 align:start position:0%
under under a nurse and a registered
nurse

06:39:33.670 --> 06:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
nurse
 
06:39:36.868 --> 06:39:36.878 align:start position:0%
or anyone who is licensed and qualified
 
06:39:38.390 --> 06:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
in the facility
 
06:39:40.310 --> 06:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
let me rephrase that
 
06:39:42.230 --> 06:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
does that mean the person who is under
 
06:39:44.548 --> 06:39:44.558 align:start position:0%
direct supervision is never out of the
 
06:39:48.708 --> 06:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
watchful eye of somebody over him or her
 
06:39:50.948 --> 06:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
well they have to go to the bathroom
 
06:39:53.190 --> 06:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry well i don't mean that but i
 
06:39:55.510 --> 06:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
mean can they go into a patient's room
 
06:39:59.510 --> 06:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
to do whatever they do without another
 
06:40:01.670 --> 06:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
staff person present
 
06:40:04.230 --> 06:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
i'll have to get back to you on that i
 
06:40:06.548 --> 06:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
think they are part of a team so they
 
06:40:08.868 --> 06:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
have to be with the staff person and so
 
06:40:08.878 --> 06:40:09.830 align:start position:0%
have to be with the staff person and so
therefore

06:40:09.830 --> 06:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
06:40:13.350 --> 06:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
if one person may be doing one
 
06:40:13.360 --> 06:40:14.230 align:start position:0%
if one person may be doing one
one

06:40:14.230 --> 06:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:40:16.310 --> 06:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
duty and another another in the same
 
06:40:18.310 --> 06:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
room but i will get back to you why i
 
06:40:20.468 --> 06:40:20.478 align:start position:0%
ask that is because my mother was in a
 
06:40:21.990 --> 06:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
06:40:23.750 --> 06:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
in met
 
06:40:23.760 --> 06:40:25.830 align:start position:0%
in met
in

06:40:25.830 --> 06:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:40:28.468 --> 06:40:28.478 align:start position:0%
and somebody was provisionally licensed
 
06:40:30.310 --> 06:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
and when they finally got the background
 
06:40:31.990 --> 06:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
in there they fired the person on the
 
06:40:32.000 --> 06:40:32.948 align:start position:0%
in there they fired the person on the
spot

06:40:32.948 --> 06:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
spot
 
06:40:35.670 --> 06:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
my mother was not in danger because that
 
06:40:37.990 --> 06:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
person was never alone with my mother
 
06:40:40.230 --> 06:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
was assisting was working as part of a
 
06:40:40.240 --> 06:40:41.350 align:start position:0%
was assisting was working as part of a
team

06:40:41.350 --> 06:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
team
 
06:40:43.190 --> 06:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
so i can understand that but if you're
 
06:40:44.948 --> 06:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
saying we're turning some people loose
 
06:40:44.958 --> 06:40:45.990 align:start position:0%
saying we're turning some people loose
here

06:40:45.990 --> 06:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:40:48.070 --> 06:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's supervision
 
06:40:50.868 --> 06:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
in a paper flow chart
 
06:40:53.350 --> 06:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
that raises some questions i will double
 
06:40:56.708 --> 06:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
check for you um and also please note
 
06:40:58.310 --> 06:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
that in here it says you have to have
 
06:41:00.150 --> 06:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
had a criminal background check within
 
06:41:02.390 --> 06:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
12 months understood now that doesn't
 
06:41:03.750 --> 06:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
mean they couldn't have done something
 
06:41:05.510 --> 06:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
within those 12 months
 
06:41:07.510 --> 06:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
but but i will double check and get back
 
06:41:09.750 --> 06:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
to you thank you representative kanark i
 
06:41:11.110 --> 06:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
think you actually have two one as a
 
06:41:13.510 --> 06:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up on yours and that is because
 
06:41:16.150 --> 06:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
in most cases direct supervision means
 
06:41:19.030 --> 06:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes we're supporting but we
 
06:41:21.190 --> 06:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
we often they are not in the room at the
 
06:41:23.270 --> 06:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
same time so i was wondering whether we
 
06:41:25.030 --> 06:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
should have something in this to clarify
 
06:41:27.670 --> 06:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
under visual direct supervision
 
06:41:29.590 --> 06:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's one that's just a question to
 
06:41:32.230 --> 06:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
follow up in his the other one was was i
 
06:41:34.230 --> 06:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
was going to ask representative abrami
 
06:41:35.750 --> 06:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
that question about who does this other
 
06:41:37.270 --> 06:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
background check and you talked about
 
06:41:39.590 --> 06:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
third parties but i don't see any
 
06:41:42.070 --> 06:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism in here about how we
 
06:41:44.310 --> 06:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
credential that third party i mean you
 
06:41:44.320 --> 06:41:45.830 align:start position:0%
credential that third party i mean you
know

06:41:45.830 --> 06:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:41:47.030 --> 06:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
it would seem like anybody could just
 
06:41:48.310 --> 06:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
kind of you know set up their little
 
06:41:49.510 --> 06:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
thing and do this
 
06:41:51.270 --> 06:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
do we have any standards for
 
06:41:53.750 --> 06:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
credentialing that third party to make
 
06:41:56.628 --> 06:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
sure that they are doing proper
 
06:41:59.830 --> 06:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
background checks and records
 
06:42:03.110 --> 06:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
i will check with the hr directors and
 
06:42:05.110 --> 06:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
find out um they
 
06:42:07.830 --> 06:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
um contract with them so they and they
 
06:42:10.150 --> 06:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
pay for those services and they're done
 
06:42:11.350 --> 06:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the country as my
 
06:42:13.670 --> 06:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
understanding um but let me get back to
 
06:42:16.150 --> 06:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
you on what the pro
 
06:42:18.788 --> 06:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
process is for them choosing these third
 
06:42:20.948 --> 06:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
parties to do this follow-up and then a
 
06:42:23.190 --> 06:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up on that is given the fact that
 
06:42:25.910 --> 06:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
the cost on page 2 line 11 the cost of
 
06:42:28.230 --> 06:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
the check is borne by the licensee or
 
06:42:29.670 --> 06:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
certificate holder
 
06:42:32.310 --> 06:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
um once they have had this check and
 
06:42:33.510 --> 06:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
let's say they
 
06:42:35.590 --> 06:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
decide they want to be going to a
 
06:42:37.270 --> 06:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
different place to work
 
06:42:39.510 --> 06:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
are they provided with a copy of that so
 
06:42:41.430 --> 06:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
that they have that as a portability
 
06:42:43.430 --> 06:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
does that have to pay that a second time
 
06:42:46.708 --> 06:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
to apply to another place in other words
 
06:42:49.190 --> 06:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
i guess does it follow the licensee who
 
06:42:51.910 --> 06:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
was applying or does it only stay with
 
06:42:54.310 --> 06:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
the institution and that licensee has to
 
06:42:57.590 --> 06:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
keep paying over and over even if just a
 
06:42:58.788 --> 06:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
few weeks later they decide they don't
 
06:43:00.070 --> 06:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
like that job and want to go somewhere
 
06:43:00.080 --> 06:43:01.110 align:start position:0%
like that job and want to go somewhere
else

06:43:01.110 --> 06:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
else
 
06:43:01.120 --> 06:43:01.990 align:start position:0%
else
so

06:43:01.990 --> 06:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:43:02.000 --> 06:43:03.270 align:start position:0%
so
the

06:43:03.270 --> 06:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:43:06.310 --> 06:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
first part is the responsibility of the
 
06:43:07.910 --> 06:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
facility to
 
06:43:10.468 --> 06:43:10.478 align:start position:0%
as a condition of employment they must
 
06:43:13.270 --> 06:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have done that fbi
 
06:43:17.270 --> 06:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
check so it is not borne by the licensee
 
06:43:20.708 --> 06:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
there's also the licensee is getting
 
06:43:23.350 --> 06:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
licensed um as a clinician so there's
 
06:43:25.430 --> 06:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
that process as well that's why it's a
 
06:43:27.110 --> 06:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
little confusing but
 
06:43:29.750 --> 06:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
they're the hospitals um i'll just speak
 
06:43:30.948 --> 06:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
for them they
 
06:43:33.430 --> 06:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
as a condition of employment they must
 
06:43:35.590 --> 06:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that they they have gone through
 
06:43:38.708 --> 06:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
this um check um this fbi check just a
 
06:43:40.548 --> 06:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
clarification follow-up sure
 
06:43:42.628 --> 06:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
you said not formed by the licensee but
 
06:43:43.830 --> 06:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
this does that it is borne by the
 
06:43:44.868 --> 06:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
licensee are we talking about the
 
06:43:47.590 --> 06:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
licensing of the person or a licensee of
 
06:43:50.310 --> 06:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
an institution well where is that uh
 
06:43:55.910 --> 06:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:56.948 --> 06:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
you know we talk about licensed
 
06:43:58.868 --> 06:43:58.878 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities and licensed
 
06:44:00.788 --> 06:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
providers what kind of license are we
 
06:44:06.628 --> 06:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:07.910 --> 06:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's what i thought it would seem like
 
06:44:09.510 --> 06:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
so the provider has to carry these no
 
06:44:11.990 --> 06:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm sorry
 
06:44:13.350 --> 06:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
i misspoke
 
06:44:14.948 --> 06:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
in order for the nursing home to be
 
06:44:14.958 --> 06:44:16.070 align:start position:0%
in order for the nursing home to be
licensed

06:44:16.070 --> 06:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
06:44:18.230 --> 06:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
they have to do the criminal background
 
06:44:20.868 --> 06:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
check before they can hire these folks
 
06:44:23.430 --> 06:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
so and at least
 
06:44:25.270 --> 06:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
when i've talked to our nursing homes
 
06:44:28.230 --> 06:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:30.150 --> 06:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes pay for it so so the
 
06:44:32.548 --> 06:44:32.558 align:start position:0%
licensee in this case is the institution
 
06:44:33.910 --> 06:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
not the person
 
06:44:33.920 --> 06:44:34.628 align:start position:0%
not the person
because

06:44:34.628 --> 06:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:44:36.868 --> 06:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
this is this statute is having to do
 
06:44:39.190 --> 06:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
with residential health facility
 
06:44:46.468 --> 06:44:46.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:48.868 --> 06:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
sorry it's no matter what
 
06:44:50.948 --> 06:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
the facility has to do the criminal
 
06:44:52.868 --> 06:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
background check which includes state
 
06:44:56.310 --> 06:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
and federal in order to hire the person
 
06:44:59.270 --> 06:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:01.750 --> 06:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
06:45:06.070 --> 06:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:07.590 --> 06:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:45:09.270 --> 06:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question on
 
06:45:11.590 --> 06:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
the federal background check
 
06:45:13.350 --> 06:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
is there one source for the check in
 
06:45:15.270 --> 06:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
other words regardless of who request
 
06:45:17.030 --> 06:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
federal background check
 
06:45:19.350 --> 06:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
is it going to be the same
 
06:45:21.430 --> 06:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
is it basically standardizes the federal
 
06:45:22.788 --> 06:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
level when i request the federal
 
06:45:23.830 --> 06:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
background check so it really doesn't
 
06:45:23.840 --> 06:45:24.788 align:start position:0%
background check so it really doesn't
matter

06:45:24.788 --> 06:45:24.798 align:start position:0%
matter
 
06:45:27.110 --> 06:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
who requests the background check at the
 
06:45:28.628 --> 06:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
federal level the report is going to
 
06:45:30.468 --> 06:45:30.478 align:start position:0%
come back the same
 
06:45:33.190 --> 06:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
is that that is i will confirm that
 
06:45:34.468 --> 06:45:34.478 align:start position:0%
representative but that's my
 
06:45:36.708 --> 06:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
understanding is the process is the same
 
06:45:39.590 --> 06:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
that they they check every single state
 
06:45:43.270 --> 06:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
um for um any criminal history on that
 
06:45:45.190 --> 06:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
individual that you're hiring so i think
 
06:45:46.948 --> 06:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
the i think you're right but i will
 
06:45:49.590 --> 06:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
confirm that thank you yeah follow up
 
06:45:50.948 --> 06:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:45:52.310 --> 06:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
06:45:52.320 --> 06:45:53.590 align:start position:0%
in regards to
the

06:45:53.590 --> 06:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:45:55.430 --> 06:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
about the licensing
 
06:45:56.708 --> 06:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
i think once you have the federal
 
06:45:58.310 --> 06:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
background check and it goes in the
 
06:45:59.750 --> 06:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
personnel file
 
06:46:01.350 --> 06:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
in essence it becomes part of their
 
06:46:03.590 --> 06:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
record and they're entitled to it so i
 
06:46:06.230 --> 06:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
would also go back onto a line
 
06:46:07.430 --> 06:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
page two
 
06:46:08.708 --> 06:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
line three
 
06:46:10.390 --> 06:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
has provided the facility and the
 
06:46:13.590 --> 06:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
licensee which is the provider a copy of
 
06:46:15.430 --> 06:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
the criminal history check
 
06:46:17.350 --> 06:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
for two reasons one is it should be part
 
06:46:19.430 --> 06:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
of their property this is in the record
 
06:46:20.868 --> 06:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
number two if they have a question about
 
06:46:22.390 --> 06:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
the history they can speak to it at that
 
06:46:25.510 --> 06:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:28.548 --> 06:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
representative not a robin
 
06:46:31.990 --> 06:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
is it on it's on would you believe i've
 
06:46:34.628 --> 06:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
been trying to renew my psychotherapy
 
06:46:36.468 --> 06:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
license through the office of
 
06:46:38.628 --> 06:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
professional licensure
 
06:46:41.030 --> 06:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
which i mailed in in july
 
06:46:43.910 --> 06:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
and in september i hear oh you need your
 
06:46:45.750 --> 06:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
fbi check
 
06:46:45.760 --> 06:46:46.628 align:start position:0%
fbi check
oh

06:46:46.628 --> 06:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:46:49.030 --> 06:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
and where do i do that well you can go
 
06:46:50.628 --> 06:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
to salem
 
06:46:50.638 --> 06:46:51.590 align:start position:0%
to salem
uh

06:46:51.590 --> 06:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:46:53.350 --> 06:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
we can give you an appointment in three
 
06:46:53.360 --> 06:46:54.230 align:start position:0%
we can give you an appointment in three
weeks

06:46:54.230 --> 06:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
06:46:55.670 --> 06:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
and it may take
 
06:46:58.628 --> 06:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
four five or six weeks for the report to
 
06:47:00.150 --> 06:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
come back
 
06:47:02.310 --> 06:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
by which time the committee who meets
 
06:47:04.788 --> 06:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
once a month has met two or three more
 
06:47:07.670 --> 06:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
times and i've missed the boat again
 
06:47:09.270 --> 06:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
 
06:47:12.390 --> 06:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
so i would think any mechanism that
 
06:47:15.190 --> 06:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
would speed this along and gather in a
 
06:47:16.868 --> 06:47:16.878 align:start position:0%
third party
 
06:47:19.350 --> 06:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
you know registered official
 
06:47:20.390 --> 06:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
up and up
 
06:47:23.110 --> 06:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
organization to speed this along
 
06:47:25.510 --> 06:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
would be an excellent idea if i had had
 
06:47:28.390 --> 06:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
a job offer it would have been blown
 
06:47:28.400 --> 06:47:29.270 align:start position:0%
a job offer it would have been blown
so

06:47:29.270 --> 06:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:47:31.990 --> 06:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i have already been licensed in the
 
06:47:35.270 --> 06:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire for 15 years
 
06:47:37.590 --> 06:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
they have all my original paperwork and
 
06:47:40.708 --> 06:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
like why do i need an fbi check but one
 
06:47:43.910 --> 06:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
that takes five six weeks is ridiculous
 
06:47:46.230 --> 06:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
now what do you believe i i believe you
 
06:47:48.708 --> 06:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
um however i do believe you represent
 
06:47:51.670 --> 06:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
and that's hard to see you over there um
 
06:47:55.030 --> 06:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
but there you are um nice to see you so
 
06:47:56.788 --> 06:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
this was in august
 
06:47:59.670 --> 06:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
is that what you said i i do believe
 
06:48:01.990 --> 06:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
would you believe that um the process
 
06:48:03.670 --> 06:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
has um improved
 
06:48:06.150 --> 06:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
significantly what happened in july
 
06:48:06.160 --> 06:48:08.708 align:start position:0%
significantly what happened in july
august

06:48:08.708 --> 06:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
august
 
06:48:11.030 --> 06:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
at the state at the state oh okay great
 
06:48:13.990 --> 06:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
because and their backlog what happened
 
06:48:16.390 --> 06:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
when the state of emergency was lifted
 
06:48:18.230 --> 06:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
um all of one of the
 
06:48:20.390 --> 06:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
90 emergency orders that i are the
 
06:48:21.750 --> 06:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
executive orders that i mentioned
 
06:48:24.230 --> 06:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
earlier today one of them had to do with
 
06:48:26.150 --> 06:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks that went
 
06:48:26.160 --> 06:48:27.030 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks that went
away

06:48:27.030 --> 06:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
away
 
06:48:29.590 --> 06:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
immediately overnight the backlog at the
 
06:48:32.390 --> 06:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
department of safety plummeted uh i mean
 
06:48:34.788 --> 06:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
expanded um so
 
06:48:38.150 --> 06:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
so then um we immediately had a
 
06:48:39.990 --> 06:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
big problem and the department of safety
 
06:48:42.788 --> 06:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
has been extraordinary in trying to help
 
06:48:45.110 --> 06:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
move this whole process along because
 
06:48:47.430 --> 06:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
they became really backlogged very
 
06:48:49.590 --> 06:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
quickly that's why things have gotten
 
06:48:51.590 --> 06:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
much better and this portal has helped
 
06:48:54.070 --> 06:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
on the state side which gives them more
 
06:48:57.510 --> 06:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work on the federal fbi
 
06:48:59.430 --> 06:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
side of things because it's the same
 
06:49:01.910 --> 06:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
staff that has to to do this and i
 
06:49:02.868 --> 06:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
thought there was someone from the
 
06:49:04.468 --> 06:49:04.478 align:start position:0%
department of safety here and maybe they
 
06:49:07.750 --> 06:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
are still here yep they're good
 
06:49:09.590 --> 06:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
so i am not going to speak for them but
 
06:49:10.868 --> 06:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
i um
 
06:49:14.070 --> 06:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
they are working very hard to address
 
06:49:16.150 --> 06:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
this so i think they would believe it i
 
06:49:18.628 --> 06:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
think things have gotten better my my
 
06:49:19.830 --> 06:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
state check
 
06:49:22.468 --> 06:49:22.478 align:start position:0%
i just drove up to concord i waited 20
 
06:49:24.708 --> 06:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
minutes in the hallway and i had it so
 
06:49:26.390 --> 06:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
they did their job great
 
06:49:28.788 --> 06:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yeah okay and i do think
 
06:49:30.468 --> 06:49:30.478 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we we have not
 
06:49:32.868 --> 06:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned here are the people who hoping
 
06:49:34.230 --> 06:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
to be employed
 
06:49:37.190 --> 06:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
and you you can't be employed unless you
 
06:49:38.868 --> 06:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
have these checks and you've got your
 
06:49:40.788 --> 06:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
license so without this
 
06:49:43.030 --> 06:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
you've got lna sitting out there that
 
06:49:44.468 --> 06:49:44.478 align:start position:0%
have finished their coursework they're
 
06:49:46.468 --> 06:49:46.478 align:start position:0%
waiting for their licensing and they've
 
06:49:49.110 --> 06:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
got a job offer and they
 
06:49:51.510 --> 06:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't you know so then the question is
 
06:49:53.670 --> 06:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
do they sit and wait to be an lna or do
 
06:49:54.628 --> 06:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
they go
 
06:49:56.788 --> 06:49:56.798 align:start position:0%
work somewhere else and so it's just
 
06:49:58.948 --> 06:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
it's just a snowballing situation we
 
06:49:58.958 --> 06:49:59.750 align:start position:0%
it's just a snowballing situation we
just

06:49:59.750 --> 06:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:50:02.070 --> 06:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
trying to get more bodies on the floor
 
06:50:05.270 --> 06:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:06.548 --> 06:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:50:09.670 --> 06:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
in regards to this bill i keep hearing
 
06:50:12.628 --> 06:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
the word lna but the way this seems to
 
06:50:15.750 --> 06:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
be written it applies to any employee
 
06:50:17.270 --> 06:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
including volunteers the scope of
 
06:50:19.510 --> 06:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
employment for direct
 
06:50:21.110 --> 06:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
contact with the patient
 
06:50:24.230 --> 06:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
plant records plant tissue battery
 
06:50:25.750 --> 06:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
fluids and so forth
 
06:50:27.830 --> 06:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
that goes way beyond an lna i mean there
 
06:50:29.750 --> 06:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
are physical therapists therapists and
 
06:50:31.910 --> 06:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
there there's nurses in there so we're
 
06:50:33.750 --> 06:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
just talking about lnac here are we
 
06:50:36.230 --> 06:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
talking about the whole scoop
 
06:50:38.230 --> 06:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
you've got the nursing homes and the
 
06:50:41.190 --> 06:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
hospital and the bill that we put in in
 
06:50:43.670 --> 06:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
17 and the bill the part of this bill
 
06:50:45.270 --> 06:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
that we put in
 
06:50:47.590 --> 06:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
for this year or asked representative
 
06:50:50.230 --> 06:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
abrami to was specifically dealing with
 
06:50:52.468 --> 06:50:52.478 align:start position:0%
the lnas because that's where we were
 
06:50:54.468 --> 06:50:54.478 align:start position:0%
having the real problem and then when
 
06:50:57.190 --> 06:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
paul in the hospital association came in
 
06:51:00.628 --> 06:51:00.638 align:start position:0%
that's when it's clinicians and expanded
 
06:51:00.638 --> 06:51:02.230 align:start position:0%
that's when it's clinicians and expanded
so

06:51:02.230 --> 06:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:51:03.990 --> 06:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
i mean frankly
 
06:51:07.430 --> 06:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's what is it line
 
06:51:10.788 --> 06:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
it's page 1 line 25
 
06:51:10.798 --> 06:51:11.670 align:start position:0%
it's page 1 line 25
through

06:51:11.670 --> 06:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:51:14.708 --> 06:51:14.718 align:start position:0%
page two line six
 
06:51:19.510 --> 06:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
that is the original bill from 2017
 
06:51:21.590 --> 06:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
that the hot the nursing homes put in
 
06:51:23.990 --> 06:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
specifically for lnas and also on the
 
06:51:25.750 --> 06:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
back page the boldest
 
06:51:28.948 --> 06:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
section so we've combined
 
06:51:31.350 --> 06:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
the clinicians with the lnas i hope that
 
06:51:33.110 --> 06:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
would that make sense
 
06:51:35.110 --> 06:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
yes and no um
 
06:51:36.468 --> 06:51:36.478 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
06:51:39.110 --> 06:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um
 
06:51:42.150 --> 06:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'm still getting hung up here between
 
06:51:44.150 --> 06:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
one part of the bill speaking to one
 
06:51:45.750 --> 06:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
scope of practitioners another one
 
06:51:47.110 --> 06:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
speaking to a limited scope of
 
06:51:48.708 --> 06:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
practitioners so i'm not sure exactly
 
06:51:50.070 --> 06:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:51:52.150 --> 06:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
which one we're trying to accomplish or
 
06:51:53.750 --> 06:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
if there's one another way to word it
 
06:51:57.590 --> 06:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
because if you go to page two
 
06:52:01.270 --> 06:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:03.830 --> 06:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
talks again nursing program approved by
 
06:52:05.270 --> 06:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
the board of nursing so we're in some
 
06:52:06.788 --> 06:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill talking specifically
 
06:52:08.948 --> 06:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
to lna right other parts of bill we're
 
06:52:10.468 --> 06:52:10.478 align:start position:0%
talking about broader scope of
 
06:52:13.510 --> 06:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
clinicians generally speaking so
 
06:52:22.230 --> 06:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:25.110 --> 06:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
if you go back and look on page one
 
06:52:28.390 --> 06:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:29.750 --> 06:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
any employee
 
06:52:29.760 --> 06:52:31.910 align:start position:0%
any employee
correct

06:52:31.910 --> 06:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:52:33.830 --> 06:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
so when you get into that it goes beyond
 
06:52:35.830 --> 06:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
an lna
 
06:52:37.110 --> 06:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
yeah which i think is what the heart is
 
06:52:39.990 --> 06:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
amending two different rsas yeah yeah
 
06:52:40.000 --> 06:52:40.708 align:start position:0%
amending two different rsas yeah yeah
but

06:52:40.708 --> 06:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:52:44.628 --> 06:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
it's because i glommed on to their bill
 
06:52:46.310 --> 06:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
because i was trying to
 
06:52:48.390 --> 06:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
create one less bill that you guys had
 
06:52:51.750 --> 06:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:53.590 --> 06:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
06:52:56.788 --> 06:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
i apologize for coming in late uh this
 
06:52:58.868 --> 06:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
deal about any employee
 
06:53:00.468 --> 06:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
because the whole bill seems to be
 
06:53:02.548 --> 06:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
written for lnas and we all know there
 
06:53:05.830 --> 06:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
is a crying need for lna's
 
06:53:07.110 --> 06:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
crying need
 
06:53:09.910 --> 06:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh in my town too
 
06:53:11.270 --> 06:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
do we
 
06:53:13.590 --> 06:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
is it going to hurt the bill
 
06:53:15.030 --> 06:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
i want everybody's opinion they're going
 
06:53:16.788 --> 06:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
to hurt the bill if we leave this to any
 
06:53:19.110 --> 06:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
employee is that going to be a hiccup
 
06:53:19.120 --> 06:53:20.310 align:start position:0%
employee is that going to be a hiccup
or

06:53:20.310 --> 06:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:53:23.030 --> 06:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
or can we leave it in there because
 
06:53:25.830 --> 06:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know we definitely need to
 
06:53:29.190 --> 06:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
give a temporary passage to be an lna is
 
06:53:30.948 --> 06:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
it going to hurt anything if we do the
 
06:53:34.070 --> 06:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
same temporary thing and my other is
 
06:53:35.590 --> 06:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
06:53:36.948 --> 06:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
that i
 
06:53:39.110 --> 06:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
be interesting to know what has to be
 
06:53:42.708 --> 06:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
approved to get the
 
06:53:43.990 --> 06:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
pending the results of the criminal
 
06:53:44.000 --> 06:53:45.350 align:start position:0%
pending the results of the criminal
history

06:53:45.350 --> 06:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
history
 
06:53:48.310 --> 06:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
the gun line is working now and it works
 
06:53:49.830 --> 06:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
in you know
 
06:53:51.270 --> 06:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
less than a day
 
06:53:53.030 --> 06:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
what's the difference
 
06:53:55.750 --> 06:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
between the requirements of passing
 
06:53:58.548 --> 06:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
the gun line as a passing to work and
 
06:54:00.150 --> 06:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
take care of people
 
06:54:01.750 --> 06:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's still the department of safety and
 
06:54:03.510 --> 06:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to defer to the
 
06:54:04.948 --> 06:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
expert that works at the department of
 
06:54:06.468 --> 06:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
safety to answer that because they're
 
06:54:09.910 --> 06:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:12.868 --> 06:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
i would not recommend expanding it this
 
06:54:15.430 --> 06:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
is specific to lnas
 
06:54:17.590 --> 06:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
and lindsey courtney who's testified
 
06:54:20.628 --> 06:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
earlier is in charge of oplc and they
 
06:54:22.868 --> 06:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
again have many many bills on that
 
06:54:24.468 --> 06:54:24.478 align:start position:0%
they're working through to try to
 
06:54:24.478 --> 06:54:25.590 align:start position:0%
they're working through to try to
address

06:54:25.590 --> 06:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
address
 
06:54:27.190 --> 06:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
some of the other issues with other
 
06:54:29.750 --> 06:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
clinicians this is very focused on lnas
 
06:54:31.270 --> 06:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
and then again
 
06:54:34.468 --> 06:54:34.478 align:start position:0%
the part of the statute that i requested
 
06:54:36.310 --> 06:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative obrami to change had to
 
06:54:38.468 --> 06:54:38.478 align:start position:0%
do with the health facilities licensing
 
06:54:39.910 --> 06:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
and just removing the department of
 
06:54:41.990 --> 06:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
safety from that
 
06:54:45.030 --> 06:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
section to try to make it easier and
 
06:54:47.110 --> 06:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
more flexible that's really all so i may
 
06:54:49.190 --> 06:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
be having a brain cramp at the moment
 
06:54:52.468 --> 06:54:52.478 align:start position:0%
but line page 1 line 16 it applies to
 
06:54:52.478 --> 06:54:55.670 align:start position:0%
but line page 1 line 16 it applies to
volunteers

06:54:55.670 --> 06:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:58.468 --> 06:54:58.478 align:start position:0%
did i have a brain cramp
 
06:55:01.190 --> 06:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's current law
 
06:55:04.150 --> 06:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
so it's still there okay it's not it's
 
06:55:05.350 --> 06:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
not going to change the point of
 
06:55:07.270 --> 06:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
information is anybody who has contact
 
06:55:11.990 --> 06:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:14.230 --> 06:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
better now thank you yeah
 
06:55:17.590 --> 06:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
we are just i think i think
 
06:55:19.590 --> 06:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
what the sections of the hospital
 
06:55:22.868 --> 06:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
association wanted to bring in is really
 
06:55:24.468 --> 06:55:24.478 align:start position:0%
trying also
 
06:55:27.270 --> 06:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
to expedite what the representative they
 
06:55:30.468 --> 06:55:30.478 align:start position:0%
needed to hire a clinician
 
06:55:33.350 --> 06:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
then again safety's done a fabulous job
 
06:55:35.190 --> 06:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
and you can get your state background
 
06:55:38.390 --> 06:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
check back in minutes but
 
06:55:40.070 --> 06:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
you can get your state background check
 
06:55:42.230 --> 06:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
back in minutes but it's the federal
 
06:55:44.468 --> 06:55:44.478 align:start position:0%
side so we're just trying across the
 
06:55:44.478 --> 06:55:45.510 align:start position:0%
side so we're just trying across the
board

06:55:45.510 --> 06:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
board
 
06:55:47.670 --> 06:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
trying to say we're not changing the
 
06:55:49.430 --> 06:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
rules you're going to continue to have
 
06:55:51.670 --> 06:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
to have that federal check we just want
 
06:55:53.190 --> 06:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to do it in the most
 
06:55:55.750 --> 06:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
expedited manner and if it turns out the
 
06:55:57.670 --> 06:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
department of safety eventually is the
 
06:55:59.750 --> 06:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
fastest and the least expensive my guess
 
06:56:02.070 --> 06:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
is people that's where people will go
 
06:56:02.080 --> 06:56:03.510 align:start position:0%
is people that's where people will go
but

06:56:03.510 --> 06:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:56:05.750 --> 06:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
if that's the next step i think you can
 
06:56:06.948 --> 06:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
ask the
 
06:56:08.390 --> 06:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
the gentleman in the back but that's the
 
06:56:10.230 --> 06:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
next step so we're just trying to get
 
06:56:12.708 --> 06:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
people on the job
 
06:56:15.750 --> 06:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions who are qualified
 
06:56:17.910 --> 06:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
yeah right yeah we're trying to do that
 
06:56:22.310 --> 06:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:24.948 --> 06:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and uh state police
 
06:56:32.708 --> 06:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:34.150 --> 06:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
06:56:36.628 --> 06:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
06:56:39.830 --> 06:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
my name is victor muzzy i am currently
 
06:56:41.270 --> 06:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
the commander of record information
 
06:56:42.548 --> 06:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
services for the new hampshire state
 
06:56:44.548 --> 06:56:44.558 align:start position:0%
police which luckily today encompasses
 
06:56:46.628 --> 06:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
the gun line or our permits and
 
06:56:48.150 --> 06:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
licensing unit in the criminal records
 
06:56:49.510 --> 06:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
unit so
 
06:56:51.190 --> 06:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
i think the state police by and large
 
06:56:52.628 --> 06:56:52.638 align:start position:0%
i'll start off by saying is in support
 
06:56:54.788 --> 06:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
of this i think we um pursuant to what's
 
06:56:56.310 --> 06:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
been discussed the troubles that we had
 
06:56:58.708 --> 06:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
with the executive order being lifted
 
06:57:01.270 --> 06:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
the rush of folks that we saw have to do
 
06:57:03.110 --> 06:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
background checks on and other things
 
06:57:04.868 --> 06:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
contributed to our delay over the summer
 
06:57:06.150 --> 06:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
which thank you for the credit and
 
06:57:07.670 --> 06:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
working through that and i think we are
 
06:57:08.468 --> 06:57:08.478 align:start position:0%
at a
 
06:57:10.548 --> 06:57:10.558 align:start position:0%
more sustainable point at this point
 
06:57:12.868 --> 06:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
with our backlog
 
06:57:15.190 --> 06:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
i think um it's important to note and my
 
06:57:17.510 --> 06:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
concern would be um as i think it's been
 
06:57:19.590 --> 06:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
brought up here this afternoon
 
06:57:19.600 --> 06:57:20.868 align:start position:0%
brought up here this afternoon
um

06:57:20.868 --> 06:57:20.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:57:23.190 --> 06:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't know what the third party
 
06:57:25.190 --> 06:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
check consists of i don't know what that
 
06:57:27.030 --> 06:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
means i don't know how that's
 
06:57:28.628 --> 06:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
credentialed and certainly if the
 
06:57:29.910 --> 06:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee decide that's
 
06:57:31.750 --> 06:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
the route that they want to go then then
 
06:57:33.430 --> 06:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
that would be fine my concern would be
 
06:57:35.990 --> 06:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
what does that really mean
 
06:57:37.670 --> 06:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
and i think to speak
 
06:57:40.310 --> 06:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
in regards to the federal process and
 
06:57:43.350 --> 06:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
why that's so cumbersome let's call it
 
06:57:45.830 --> 06:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
um is a result of of the process that we
 
06:57:47.670 --> 06:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
go through in which to retrieve that
 
06:57:49.830 --> 06:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
record which as most of you are probably
 
06:57:52.230 --> 06:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with requires the applicant to
 
06:57:54.150 --> 06:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
get fingerprinted
 
06:57:55.830 --> 06:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
typically at one of our live scan
 
06:57:59.030 --> 06:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
machines which is uh ever so helpful
 
06:58:01.670 --> 06:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
um if we if they get printed by uh ten
 
06:58:03.430 --> 06:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
print ink cards as we call them the
 
06:58:04.948 --> 06:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
manual fingerprint cards that everyone
 
06:58:06.548 --> 06:58:06.558 align:start position:0%
is probably familiar with that requires
 
06:58:08.310 --> 06:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
an extra step for us
 
06:58:09.910 --> 06:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
our folks actually have to scan that
 
06:58:12.628 --> 06:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
fingerprint card into some software
 
06:58:14.708 --> 06:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
where they then do some quality control
 
06:58:18.230 --> 06:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
and some pre um classification of that
 
06:58:19.990 --> 06:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
fingerprint ahead of it's being sent to
 
06:58:22.070 --> 06:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
the fbi
 
06:58:23.670 --> 06:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
our aphis machines as they're referred
 
06:58:24.868 --> 06:58:24.878 align:start position:0%
to the automated fingerprint
 
06:58:27.270 --> 06:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
identification systems that we have um
 
06:58:28.868 --> 06:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
where we're electronically capturing
 
06:58:31.430 --> 06:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
those prints does a couple things a the
 
06:58:33.510 --> 06:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
prints are far more clear
 
06:58:35.030 --> 06:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
and the rejection rate now that's the
 
06:58:37.270 --> 06:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
rejection rate from the fbi not from the
 
06:58:40.310 --> 06:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
state police the rejection rate
 
06:58:43.030 --> 06:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
goes down quite significantly for us
 
06:58:44.468 --> 06:58:44.478 align:start position:0%
we're able to obviously we have that
 
06:58:46.788 --> 06:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
electronic file for those fingerprint
 
06:58:48.628 --> 06:58:48.638 align:start position:0%
images that we're able to process much
 
06:58:50.708 --> 06:58:50.718 align:start position:0%
more quickly but i will say it does
 
06:58:52.628 --> 06:58:52.638 align:start position:0%
require a set of human eyeballs to look
 
06:58:54.468 --> 06:58:54.478 align:start position:0%
at each set of fingerprints that we
 
06:58:56.390 --> 06:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
collect for an applicant that
 
06:58:56.400 --> 06:58:57.430 align:start position:0%
collect for an applicant that
causes

06:58:57.430 --> 06:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
causes
 
06:58:59.990 --> 06:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
some of that delay so our people our
 
06:59:02.468 --> 06:59:02.478 align:start position:0%
experts in the in the unit
 
06:59:03.830 --> 06:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
have to actually classify those
 
06:59:07.270 --> 06:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
fingerprints um
 
06:59:09.190 --> 06:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
quality control them classify them ahead
 
06:59:11.030 --> 06:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
of them being sent off to the fbi the
 
06:59:13.510 --> 06:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
fbi gets those fingerprints
 
06:59:13.520 --> 06:59:14.548 align:start position:0%
fbi gets those fingerprints
they

06:59:14.548 --> 06:59:14.558 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:59:16.468 --> 06:59:16.478 align:start position:0%
look at our preliminary determination
 
06:59:18.070 --> 06:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
they make some further findings as to
 
06:59:19.430 --> 06:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
classifying those and quality
 
06:59:21.270 --> 06:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
controlling them and then they send us
 
06:59:21.280 --> 06:59:22.230 align:start position:0%
controlling them and then they send us
back

06:59:22.230 --> 06:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
back
 
06:59:25.030 --> 06:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
15 exemplar potential fingerprint
 
06:59:25.040 --> 06:59:26.070 align:start position:0%
15 exemplar potential fingerprint
matches

06:59:26.070 --> 06:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
matches
 
06:59:27.590 --> 06:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's our job to then go through those
 
06:59:29.350 --> 06:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
matches and ultimately go back and forth
 
06:59:31.270 --> 06:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
with the fbi until a final determination
 
06:59:32.390 --> 06:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
as to
 
06:59:34.070 --> 06:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
verifying this person's identity through
 
06:59:35.750 --> 06:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
their fingerprints from that we then
 
06:59:35.760 --> 06:59:36.548 align:start position:0%
their fingerprints from that we then
match

06:59:36.548 --> 06:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
match
 
06:59:38.948 --> 06:59:38.958 align:start position:0%
that fbi record to those fingerprints so
 
06:59:40.230 --> 06:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
again i can't account for what a
 
06:59:41.750 --> 06:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
third-party vendor may do in that
 
06:59:43.990 --> 06:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
instance that's what we do
 
06:59:45.190 --> 06:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
and that's what contributes to that
 
06:59:46.868 --> 06:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
delay i can tell you that our focus has
 
06:59:49.350 --> 06:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
largely been the applicant uh prince as
 
06:59:50.948 --> 06:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
all of you are probably well aware as
 
06:59:53.270 --> 06:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's as it's pressing for us also
 
06:59:55.430 --> 06:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
um so that as a result of that our
 
06:59:57.510 --> 06:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
criminal side of fingerprint
 
06:59:59.590 --> 06:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
identification and submission to the fbi
 
07:00:01.910 --> 07:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
for our arrests has created a backlog
 
07:00:03.510 --> 07:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
we're in a backlog for that at the
 
07:00:04.628 --> 07:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
moment so
 
07:00:06.230 --> 07:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully that helps explain a little
 
07:00:08.150 --> 07:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
bit of of a couple things why the
 
07:00:10.548 --> 07:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
process gets delayed um and the reason
 
07:00:12.548 --> 07:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
for that um and again we're in support
 
07:00:13.830 --> 07:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill and our only concern would
 
07:00:15.270 --> 07:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
be what how are these third-party
 
07:00:17.350 --> 07:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
vendors credentialed what are what are
 
07:00:19.430 --> 07:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
the uh prospective employers really
 
07:00:21.670 --> 07:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
getting for a records check i don't i
 
07:00:22.948 --> 07:00:22.958 align:start position:0%
don't know what the result of those
 
07:00:24.708 --> 07:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
things are um or what they may or may
 
07:00:25.750 --> 07:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
not be
 
07:00:25.760 --> 07:00:27.190 align:start position:0%
not be
um

07:00:27.190 --> 07:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:28.788 --> 07:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
how official quote unquote that record
 
07:00:30.628 --> 07:00:30.638 align:start position:0%
may or may not be so
 
07:00:32.788 --> 07:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
um i hope that answers the the topics
 
07:00:33.990 --> 07:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
that have been discussed and i'm happy
 
07:00:35.910 --> 07:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
to take any questions any questions for
 
07:00:38.628 --> 07:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant representative canark yes
 
07:00:39.670 --> 07:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
since i was the one that asked that
 
07:00:41.030 --> 07:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
question about credentialing of these
 
07:00:44.628 --> 07:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
third parties do you have any idea of
 
07:00:46.230 --> 07:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
are there any national standards there's
 
07:00:48.070 --> 07:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
any credentialing agency or anything
 
07:00:49.350 --> 07:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
i'll have to get back to you on that it
 
07:00:50.390 --> 07:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
seems we've had a couple of
 
07:00:52.310 --> 07:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
conversations about that
 
07:00:53.990 --> 07:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and what stands out in my mind is
 
07:00:57.030 --> 07:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
that i'm not sure that the federal check
 
07:00:59.190 --> 07:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
by a third party vendor would be
 
07:01:02.628 --> 07:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
fingerprint supported meaning
 
07:01:04.628 --> 07:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
the federal check may be run for
 
07:01:06.628 --> 07:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
convictions but the identity of that
 
07:01:06.638 --> 07:01:07.670 align:start position:0%
convictions but the identity of that
person

07:01:07.670 --> 07:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
person
 
07:01:09.350 --> 07:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
may or may not be confirmed via the
 
07:01:11.190 --> 07:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
fingerprints but don't quote me on that
 
07:01:12.868 --> 07:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
that's that's what comes to mind based
 
07:01:12.878 --> 07:01:13.750 align:start position:0%
that's that's what comes to mind based
upon

07:01:13.750 --> 07:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
upon
 
07:01:15.510 --> 07:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of ancillary conversations i've
 
07:01:17.350 --> 07:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
had relative to third-party checks
 
07:01:19.510 --> 07:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative would you thank you would
 
07:01:21.910 --> 07:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
you then suggest that we would
 
07:01:21.920 --> 07:01:22.628 align:start position:0%
you then suggest that we would
uh

07:01:22.628 --> 07:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:01:24.230 --> 07:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps amend this by adding some
 
07:01:26.628 --> 07:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
language that would identify
 
07:01:29.190 --> 07:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
how it is credentialed but if there's if
 
07:01:31.110 --> 07:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
there is no credentialing we have no
 
07:01:32.548 --> 07:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
idea how they're credentialed i'm not
 
07:01:34.230 --> 07:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
sure what language we could add so can
 
07:01:35.670 --> 07:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
you give me some guidance on that yeah
 
07:01:37.110 --> 07:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i don't have that guidance at the
 
07:01:38.948 --> 07:01:38.958 align:start position:0%
moment i don't know what the language
 
07:01:40.468 --> 07:01:40.478 align:start position:0%
should be relative to that i'd have to
 
07:01:42.070 --> 07:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
research myself
 
07:01:44.708 --> 07:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
um and and perhaps find out
 
07:01:46.390 --> 07:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
about the third party vendor i'm not
 
07:01:48.310 --> 07:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to that at all i think from a
 
07:01:50.948 --> 07:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
safety standpoint though i can't
 
07:01:52.390 --> 07:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know how that would
 
07:01:54.390 --> 07:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
it may be perfectly fine uh honestly i
 
07:01:55.430 --> 07:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
just don't know the answer if that's my
 
07:01:56.468 --> 07:01:56.478 align:start position:0%
only concern
 
07:01:59.110 --> 07:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
07:02:04.788 --> 07:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:06.390 --> 07:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
saying i think the only other thing i
 
07:02:08.390 --> 07:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
can speak to is the gun line question as
 
07:02:10.548 --> 07:02:10.558 align:start position:0%
to why the gun line is quicker
 
07:02:12.230 --> 07:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
i think because when it when a record
 
07:02:13.670 --> 07:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
check is run through the gun line it's
 
07:02:15.190 --> 07:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
not supported with fingerprints it's
 
07:02:16.788 --> 07:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
simply seeing what is on the record
 
07:02:16.798 --> 07:02:17.750 align:start position:0%
simply seeing what is on the record
versus

07:02:17.750 --> 07:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
versus
 
07:02:19.190 --> 07:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
doing all that preliminary homework to
 
07:02:20.390 --> 07:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
determine that we have the right person
 
07:02:21.830 --> 07:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
in front of us i think i think nothing
 
07:02:23.350 --> 07:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
from aphis
 
07:02:24.868 --> 07:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay
 
07:02:27.190 --> 07:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
okay actually sir anybody understands
 
07:02:28.628 --> 07:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
you're on a roll yeah could we ask you
 
07:02:31.030 --> 07:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
to forward that information to us your
 
07:02:33.110 --> 07:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
concepts about the credentialing because
 
07:02:34.788 --> 07:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
if that is a sticking point it's hard
 
07:02:36.548 --> 07:02:36.558 align:start position:0%
for us to process this bill unless we've
 
07:02:38.150 --> 07:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
got that information i can do that is
 
07:02:40.548 --> 07:02:40.558 align:start position:0%
there an email or a particular
 
07:02:42.390 --> 07:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
venue that that should be sent to
 
07:02:42.400 --> 07:02:43.270 align:start position:0%
venue that that should be sent to
the

07:02:43.270 --> 07:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:02:43.280 --> 07:02:44.468 align:start position:0%
the
committee

07:02:44.468 --> 07:02:44.478 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:02:48.230 --> 07:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
all house members of the health human
 
07:02:50.230 --> 07:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
of our committee yeah yeah not not all
 
07:02:52.150 --> 07:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
house members not all the house members
 
07:02:53.750 --> 07:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am on our committee yeah if you
 
07:02:55.510 --> 07:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
go to the committee page it has email
 
07:02:57.110 --> 07:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
all committee members perfect click very
 
07:03:00.548 --> 07:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
very good hhs e a lecture
 
07:03:02.868 --> 07:03:02.878 align:start position:0%
dot nh dot u s
 
07:03:05.670 --> 07:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative canuck would you be
 
07:03:07.430 --> 07:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
happy to take up a little amendment
 
07:03:09.030 --> 07:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
committee i don't think it would be much
 
07:03:10.788 --> 07:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
but it would be addressing that and
 
07:03:12.310 --> 07:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
quite possibly
 
07:03:15.590 --> 07:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
page 1 line 29 my
 
07:03:18.150 --> 07:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
desire to see the word visual added in
 
07:03:20.868 --> 07:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
there it is under direct visual
 
07:03:20.878 --> 07:03:22.788 align:start position:0%
there it is under direct visual
supervision

07:03:22.788 --> 07:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
07:03:26.070 --> 07:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
rather than merely administrative
 
07:03:27.910 --> 07:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
i i would think so i'm not sure any much
 
07:03:29.430 --> 07:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
of a committee i would just be glad to
 
07:03:29.440 --> 07:03:30.230 align:start position:0%
of a committee i would just be glad to
just

07:03:30.230 --> 07:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
just
 
07:03:33.430 --> 07:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
do it i would think uh if someone
 
07:03:35.270 --> 07:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean just it doesn't have to be
 
07:03:36.868 --> 07:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean the two of you have the same
 
07:03:38.468 --> 07:03:38.478 align:start position:0%
concern about visual because we've both
 
07:03:41.190 --> 07:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
supervised people where you know you're
 
07:03:43.430 --> 07:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
not even the same place but we're their
 
07:03:45.830 --> 07:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
direct supervis supervisor
 
07:03:48.070 --> 07:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
well that's not enough for me exactly
 
07:03:50.548 --> 07:03:50.558 align:start position:0%
because they if they're a convicted
 
07:03:52.230 --> 07:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
elderly abuser you don't want them in
 
07:03:53.590 --> 07:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
there take care of them so if
 
07:03:55.590 --> 07:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative woods and representative
 
07:03:57.270 --> 07:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
kinerick would do this this would be a
 
07:04:01.750 --> 07:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:03.190 --> 07:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
i hope everybody got that it's too late
 
07:04:04.468 --> 07:04:04.478 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon
 
07:04:07.270 --> 07:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative gay
 
07:04:10.948 --> 07:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
thank you um what is this uh third party
 
07:04:10.958 --> 07:04:11.750 align:start position:0%
thank you um what is this uh third party
that

07:04:11.750 --> 07:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:04:14.150 --> 07:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
is this a third party we're going to use
 
07:04:17.750 --> 07:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
to make the fbi happy or whatever
 
07:04:20.150 --> 07:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
i believe there are third party vendors
 
07:04:22.230 --> 07:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
that will supply
 
07:04:22.240 --> 07:04:23.270 align:start position:0%
that will supply
federal

07:04:23.270 --> 07:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
federal
 
07:04:26.070 --> 07:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
record checks for a cost
 
07:04:27.990 --> 07:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
what that means or what they have at
 
07:04:29.990 --> 07:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
their disposal i don't know that's i
 
07:04:31.830 --> 07:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
guess our concern i i have to do the
 
07:04:34.150 --> 07:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
research on that myself to understand
 
07:04:38.948 --> 07:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:41.510 --> 07:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up and and that is permitted by
 
07:04:43.910 --> 07:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
the fbi that they accept these
 
07:04:46.310 --> 07:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
third-party people
 
07:04:46.320 --> 07:04:47.510 align:start position:0%
third-party people
it's

07:04:47.510 --> 07:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
07:04:48.948 --> 07:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
it's permitted it would in this case
 
07:04:51.350 --> 07:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
would be permitted by the employer
 
07:04:52.390 --> 07:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
as to
 
07:04:55.190 --> 07:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
where that check came from i think
 
07:04:57.590 --> 07:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
i guess i would equate it to
 
07:04:59.030 --> 07:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
a google search where you're going to
 
07:05:00.150 --> 07:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
get whatever you're going to get back
 
07:05:01.830 --> 07:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
from the internet i don't know what
 
07:05:05.110 --> 07:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
venue these this this third-party
 
07:05:06.788 --> 07:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
supplier of background checks i don't
 
07:05:08.310 --> 07:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
know where they're getting that they may
 
07:05:10.628 --> 07:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
be getting it directly from the fbi and
 
07:05:12.310 --> 07:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
if so then i think that would be
 
07:05:14.628 --> 07:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
sufficient for the purposes of the check
 
07:05:15.990 --> 07:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
i just don't know the answer to that and
 
07:05:17.510 --> 07:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
that would be my only concern is to
 
07:05:19.830 --> 07:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
determine that
 
07:05:21.030 --> 07:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
one more
 
07:05:23.830 --> 07:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
so if say a nursing home
 
07:05:25.430 --> 07:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
is trying to
 
07:05:25.440 --> 07:05:26.310 align:start position:0%
is trying to
match

07:05:26.310 --> 07:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
match
 
07:05:28.390 --> 07:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
trying to fulfill all the requirements
 
07:05:30.230 --> 07:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this is a federal
 
07:05:30.240 --> 07:05:31.670 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this is a federal
requirement

07:05:31.670 --> 07:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
07:05:33.830 --> 07:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
so that's why i was wondering that would
 
07:05:36.628 --> 07:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
the federal requirement be satisfied by
 
07:05:39.590 --> 07:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
a third party
 
07:05:42.708 --> 07:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
they would no no good question
 
07:05:43.590 --> 07:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
is it
 
07:05:45.830 --> 07:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative speak to it no i don't
 
07:05:47.350 --> 07:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
know i said it's a good question it is a
 
07:05:48.548 --> 07:05:48.558 align:start position:0%
good question oh i thought you had a
 
07:06:03.990 --> 07:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:06.230 --> 07:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i forget i can't speak so loud
 
07:06:08.868 --> 07:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
in a math um the hospitals and the
 
07:06:11.030 --> 07:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
nursing homes now accept the third party
 
07:06:11.040 --> 07:06:11.990 align:start position:0%
nursing homes now accept the third party
checks

07:06:11.990 --> 07:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
checks
 
07:06:14.230 --> 07:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
and they have to be
 
07:06:16.390 --> 07:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
and i i will find out
 
07:06:19.670 --> 07:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
about what the credentialing is etc but
 
07:06:21.590 --> 07:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
in order to see if i can even get you
 
07:06:24.708 --> 07:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
what maybe they they give you back
 
07:06:26.468 --> 07:06:26.478 align:start position:0%
but it's what
 
07:06:29.270 --> 07:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
the most important thing is we have to
 
07:06:29.280 --> 07:06:30.310 align:start position:0%
the most important thing is we have to
meet

07:06:30.310 --> 07:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
meet
 
07:06:32.788 --> 07:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
the licensing guidelines the federal and
 
07:06:34.948 --> 07:06:34.958 align:start position:0%
the state guidelines should be licensed
 
07:06:37.430 --> 07:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
and if you don't meet that then
 
07:06:39.030 --> 07:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
obviously you can't run a nursing home
 
07:06:41.030 --> 07:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
or a hospital so i think everybody's
 
07:06:43.270 --> 07:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
trying to be very careful
 
07:06:45.030 --> 07:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
about what they do but i'll get you the
 
07:06:51.430 --> 07:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:53.110 --> 07:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
so my life's work i consulted in
 
07:06:55.990 --> 07:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals for 43 years so wow
 
07:06:58.628 --> 07:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
yeah i did operations consulting i
 
07:06:59.990 --> 07:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
i work with every department in
 
07:07:00.000 --> 07:07:01.030 align:start position:0%
i work with every department in
hospitals

07:07:01.030 --> 07:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
07:07:03.430 --> 07:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
hr departments tend to
 
07:07:03.440 --> 07:07:04.230 align:start position:0%
hr departments tend to
uh

07:07:04.230 --> 07:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:07:06.548 --> 07:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
basically uh
 
07:07:06.558 --> 07:07:07.430 align:start position:0%
basically uh
shift

07:07:07.430 --> 07:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
shift
 
07:07:08.548 --> 07:07:08.558 align:start position:0%
the burden of having to do the
 
07:07:11.190 --> 07:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
background checks to these third parties
 
07:07:12.788 --> 07:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
that aren't really doing the checks
 
07:07:14.628 --> 07:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
they're just doing the paperwork
 
07:07:15.910 --> 07:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
affiliate you know instead of one of
 
07:07:17.750 --> 07:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
their people having to do it
 
07:07:19.270 --> 07:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
that's what happens but they're still
 
07:07:20.708 --> 07:07:20.718 align:start position:0%
going through the fbi they're doing all
 
07:07:21.750 --> 07:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
of that
 
07:07:23.670 --> 07:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
so but i i think what we can do is i
 
07:07:26.230 --> 07:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
would suggest to uh both associations
 
07:07:28.868 --> 07:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
that they get one of their members to
 
07:07:31.430 --> 07:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
clarify that that's exactly what's going
 
07:07:31.440 --> 07:07:32.468 align:start position:0%
clarify that that's exactly what's going
on

07:07:32.468 --> 07:07:32.478 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:07:35.110 --> 07:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
um and there are reputable firms i mean
 
07:07:36.788 --> 07:07:36.798 align:start position:0%
this is very common across the country i
 
07:07:38.628 --> 07:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
consulted all over the country
 
07:07:38.638 --> 07:07:39.670 align:start position:0%
consulted all over the country
and

07:07:39.670 --> 07:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:07:39.680 --> 07:07:40.708 align:start position:0%
and
using

07:07:40.708 --> 07:07:40.718 align:start position:0%
using
 
07:07:42.310 --> 07:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
third parties to
 
07:07:45.270 --> 07:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
help them process get the paperwork
 
07:07:47.190 --> 07:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
through but they they they don't do the
 
07:07:49.670 --> 07:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
check themselves they are doing the
 
07:07:51.110 --> 07:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
reaching out to
 
07:07:53.510 --> 07:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
whoever in that state or and as well as
 
07:07:54.868 --> 07:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
the fbi
 
07:07:58.310 --> 07:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
to uh to get the backgrounds checked so
 
07:07:58.320 --> 07:07:59.190 align:start position:0%
to uh to get the backgrounds checked so
but

07:07:59.190 --> 07:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:08:01.510 --> 07:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps i'm sure um
 
07:08:04.150 --> 07:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
teresa and paula are going to
 
07:08:06.788 --> 07:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
talk to their members and give you some
 
07:08:08.548 --> 07:08:08.558 align:start position:0%
real life examples of
 
07:08:10.468 --> 07:08:10.478 align:start position:0%
to confirm that as well
 
07:08:12.548 --> 07:08:12.558 align:start position:0%
and that should go to representatives
 
07:08:15.590 --> 07:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
connect and woods who are the amendment
 
07:08:17.990 --> 07:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
team on this the tweaking team okay i
 
07:08:20.070 --> 07:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
know both of them well yeah
 
07:08:20.080 --> 07:08:20.868 align:start position:0%
know both of them well yeah
okay

07:08:20.868 --> 07:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:08:22.390 --> 07:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
07:08:24.708 --> 07:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
so this ends the hearing
 
07:08:27.510 --> 07:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1659 thank you
 
07:08:30.230 --> 07:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative brahmi and
 
07:08:32.390 --> 07:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
teresa and paula and lieutenant who's
 
07:08:34.070 --> 07:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
left and so on
 
07:08:36.390 --> 07:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
um i asked the ranking
 
07:08:38.070 --> 07:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
or asked
 
07:08:39.670 --> 07:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
the co-ranking
 
07:08:41.990 --> 07:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
democrat member if she had any
 
07:08:44.468 --> 07:08:44.478 align:start position:0%
objections with a couple of these bills
 
07:08:46.310 --> 07:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
because it didn't look like we had any
 
07:08:48.788 --> 07:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
objections on our side of the playground
 
07:08:48.798 --> 07:08:49.670 align:start position:0%
objections on our side of the playground
either

07:08:49.670 --> 07:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
either
 
07:08:49.680 --> 07:08:50.430 align:start position:0%
either
so

07:08:50.430 --> 07:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:08:50.440 --> 07:08:51.990 align:start position:0%
so
1327

07:08:51.990 --> 07:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
1327
 
07:08:52.000 --> 07:08:54.230 align:start position:0%
1327
including

07:08:54.230 --> 07:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
including
 
07:08:56.948 --> 07:08:56.958 align:start position:0%
this opens the hearing the exec session
 
07:08:59.590 --> 07:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1327
 
07:09:02.070 --> 07:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
including diabetes and the conditions
 
07:09:04.948 --> 07:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
listed for eligibility for a service
 
07:09:07.350 --> 07:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
animal and you remember senator
 
07:09:09.110 --> 07:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
shaheen's grand
 
07:09:12.708 --> 07:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
daughter and grand dog and uh
 
07:09:16.390 --> 07:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
the testimony about how
 
07:09:20.150 --> 07:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:20.160 --> 07:09:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
monitor

07:09:23.510 --> 07:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:26.948 --> 07:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
thank you continuous glucose monitor
 
07:09:28.788 --> 07:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
but we saw that the dog sometimes
 
07:09:30.868 --> 07:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
figured it out first and
 
07:09:32.868 --> 07:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
when you're cold and lonely the monitor
 
07:09:35.190 --> 07:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything for you but that dog
 
07:09:36.468 --> 07:09:36.478 align:start position:0%
is your friend
 
07:09:42.230 --> 07:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:44.150 --> 07:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
should someone make a motion first
 
07:09:46.628 --> 07:09:46.638 align:start position:0%
oh probably a good idea who would like
 
07:09:47.990 --> 07:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
to make a
 
07:09:51.270 --> 07:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
motion of otp anybody
 
07:09:51.280 --> 07:09:53.430 align:start position:0%
motion of otp anybody
representatively

07:09:53.430 --> 07:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
representatively
 
07:09:53.440 --> 07:09:54.310 align:start position:0%
representatively
on

07:09:54.310 --> 07:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:09:57.190 --> 07:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to move that ought to pass on
 
07:09:58.948 --> 07:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
07:10:02.310 --> 07:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
13 20 13 27 need to keep my paper
 
07:10:04.230 --> 07:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
straight and do we have a second from
 
07:10:07.510 --> 07:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
over here representative shapiro
 
07:10:11.510 --> 07:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:13.990 --> 07:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
or not representative woods
 
07:10:16.230 --> 07:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
i heartily support this i
 
07:10:18.948 --> 07:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
uh very familiar with the uh dogs in
 
07:10:20.468 --> 07:10:20.478 align:start position:0%
this particular setting and their
 
07:10:21.990 --> 07:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
ability to do that
 
07:10:24.548 --> 07:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
uh i inadvertently just mentioned it to
 
07:10:26.468 --> 07:10:26.478 align:start position:0%
my daughter who is an em
 
07:10:28.468 --> 07:10:28.478 align:start position:0%
not at the moment was an emt for about
 
07:10:29.670 --> 07:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
12 years
 
07:10:32.548 --> 07:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
um and she was very familiar with this
 
07:10:34.708 --> 07:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
by virtue of meeting people they picked
 
07:10:36.948 --> 07:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
up with diabetes and they said that they
 
07:10:38.070 --> 07:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
work well
 
07:10:40.708 --> 07:10:40.718 align:start position:0%
and to that point when i ask
 
07:10:43.430 --> 07:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
can the dog actually do a better job
 
07:10:43.440 --> 07:10:44.948 align:start position:0%
can the dog actually do a better job
because

07:10:44.948 --> 07:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:10:46.390 --> 07:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
glucose monitor
 
07:10:49.590 --> 07:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
gets you at a high level a dog is at a
 
07:10:51.590 --> 07:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
lower level and it's the lower the
 
07:10:54.788 --> 07:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
consistent lower glucose level that are
 
07:10:56.948 --> 07:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
just above the abnormal that cause the
 
07:10:59.590 --> 07:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
consistent level of damage in diabetes
 
07:11:00.948 --> 07:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
one yeah the
 
07:11:04.230 --> 07:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
the retinopathy the neuropathy and all
 
07:11:06.070 --> 07:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
the other organ changes that we know
 
07:11:08.788 --> 07:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
occur with because it's a microvascular
 
07:11:08.798 --> 07:11:09.990 align:start position:0%
occur with because it's a microvascular
disease

07:11:09.990 --> 07:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
disease
 
07:11:13.110 --> 07:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
and the small vessels get damaged
 
07:11:14.948 --> 07:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they are
 
07:11:16.948 --> 07:11:16.958 align:start position:0%
and it's that constant level just above
 
07:11:18.150 --> 07:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
the normal
 
07:11:19.750 --> 07:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
that creates the issue
 
07:11:21.590 --> 07:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
which the the
 
07:11:23.910 --> 07:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
dog can detect whereas the
 
07:11:27.670 --> 07:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
the continuous monitors are can't do so
 
07:11:30.708 --> 07:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm very much in favor of this
 
07:11:32.548 --> 07:11:32.558 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
07:11:34.070 --> 07:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'll speak if i may
 
07:11:35.670 --> 07:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
when i was on wall street i worked with
 
07:11:37.670 --> 07:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
the continuous glucose monitor companies
 
07:11:39.350 --> 07:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
and one of their biggest challenges was
 
07:11:41.590 --> 07:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
figuring out how to deal with lows
 
07:11:43.510 --> 07:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
they you heard how some of them went
 
07:11:45.350 --> 07:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
blind to the noise because they got the
 
07:11:47.910 --> 07:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
alarms too long too often and if you
 
07:11:49.670 --> 07:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
miss a low alarm and nobody else is
 
07:11:51.510 --> 07:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
there you're dead
 
07:11:53.750 --> 07:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
and the insulin pumps don't do anything
 
07:11:54.868 --> 07:11:54.878 align:start position:0%
they don't they can only bring your
 
07:11:56.468 --> 07:11:56.478 align:start position:0%
blood sugar down they haven't figured
 
07:11:58.310 --> 07:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
out how to put the one that brings your
 
07:12:00.788 --> 07:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
blood sugar up into the pumps yet
 
07:12:00.798 --> 07:12:01.670 align:start position:0%
blood sugar up into the pumps yet
so

07:12:01.670 --> 07:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:12:03.190 --> 07:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
they're not only trying to get the low
 
07:12:04.868 --> 07:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
side correct but they're also trying to
 
07:12:08.070 --> 07:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
catch the speed of decline and they
 
07:12:09.590 --> 07:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
the sensors just aren't good enough for
 
07:12:11.350 --> 07:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
that yet but these dogs are little
 
07:12:13.910 --> 07:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
miracles that are a companion that fill
 
07:12:16.708 --> 07:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
in exactly where the cgm's are weak and
 
07:12:18.548 --> 07:12:18.558 align:start position:0%
that allows the
 
07:12:21.030 --> 07:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
the person to then try and aim for a
 
07:12:22.948 --> 07:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
better therapeutic range because they're
 
07:12:25.350 --> 07:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
not as worried about those lows because
 
07:12:27.030 --> 07:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
you want to stay as close to normal as
 
07:12:29.350 --> 07:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
possible you don't want to be 20 points
 
07:12:31.750 --> 07:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
higher just to avoid that low i think
 
07:12:34.310 --> 07:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
that this is i'm so lucky i'm so happy
 
07:12:38.788 --> 07:12:38.798 align:start position:0%

sir

07:14:39.590 --> 07:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
sir
 
07:14:41.590 --> 07:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
a point of order i had contacted you
 
07:14:43.510 --> 07:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
that we had not resolved some issues on
 
07:14:43.520 --> 07:14:46.788 align:start position:0%
that we had not resolved some issues on
this

07:14:46.788 --> 07:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:48.708 --> 07:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
yes sir you did yes because there was
 
07:14:50.788 --> 07:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
the the person who
 
07:14:52.628 --> 07:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
um from the department said it needs to
 
07:14:54.468 --> 07:14:54.478 align:start position:0%
be 21 business days it was just as
 
07:14:56.708 --> 07:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
simple leaving out a word it's business
 
07:14:59.270 --> 07:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
days and line 10 but it's not in line
 
07:14:59.280 --> 07:15:00.070 align:start position:0%
days and line 10 but it's not in line
eight

07:15:00.070 --> 07:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
eight
 
07:15:01.670 --> 07:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
and i also
 
07:15:02.708 --> 07:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
brought up the question across
 
07:15:04.230 --> 07:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
referencing so a person can't just
 
07:15:04.240 --> 07:15:05.350 align:start position:0%
referencing so a person can't just
rebrand

07:15:05.350 --> 07:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
rebrand
 
07:15:07.990 --> 07:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
and open up a new facility and then have
 
07:15:10.070 --> 07:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
no record and she thought that was
 
07:15:11.510 --> 07:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
intriguing and wanted to see if they
 
07:15:13.670 --> 07:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
could do it so we still have some work
 
07:15:15.590 --> 07:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
to do on this one i'm afraid the chair
 
07:15:17.910 --> 07:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
did not accept your motion good though
 
07:15:19.030 --> 07:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
it was so
 
07:15:19.040 --> 07:15:20.708 align:start position:0%
it was so

relative to state grants for researching
 
07:15:48.548 --> 07:15:48.558 align:start position:0%
the effects on the human body of covet
 
07:15:50.948 --> 07:15:50.958 align:start position:0%
19. are we good to go on that everybody
 
07:15:56.868 --> 07:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:59.270 --> 07:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we heard this on 11 representative
 
07:15:59.280 --> 07:16:00.468 align:start position:0%
yeah we heard this on 11 representative
greeson

07:16:00.468 --> 07:16:00.478 align:start position:0%
greeson
 
07:16:02.868 --> 07:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
sole sponsor he wanted to get a study
 
07:16:02.878 --> 07:16:04.868 align:start position:0%
sole sponsor he wanted to get a study
going

07:16:04.868 --> 07:16:04.878 align:start position:0%
going
 
07:16:09.430 --> 07:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
and we had a lot of trouble with it
 
07:16:12.788 --> 07:16:12.798 align:start position:0%
before i plow in and make a mistake uh
 
07:16:15.350 --> 07:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think we put together any kind
 
07:16:17.270 --> 07:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
of an amendment thing i think we all
 
07:16:19.430 --> 07:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
just did what you're doing
 
07:16:20.868 --> 07:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
so so
 
07:16:22.628 --> 07:16:22.638 align:start position:0%
we can go with this one
 
07:16:28.230 --> 07:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:30.150 --> 07:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh i'm saying generally
 
07:16:30.160 --> 07:16:31.190 align:start position:0%
uh i'm saying generally
yeah

07:16:31.190 --> 07:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:16:34.230 --> 07:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
okay so there's no pending amendments or
 
07:16:36.150 --> 07:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
anything that i have forgotten all right
 
07:16:36.160 --> 07:16:37.190 align:start position:0%
anything that i have forgotten all right
good

07:17:44.788 --> 07:17:44.798 align:start position:0%
he's an md he does a bone marrow
 
07:17:47.030 --> 07:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
transplant but he's also a researcher
 
07:17:49.350 --> 07:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
he's also a reviewer for nih and so i
 
07:17:52.230 --> 07:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
went with him in detail over this grant
 
07:17:52.240 --> 07:17:53.350 align:start position:0%
went with him in detail over this grant
process

07:17:53.350 --> 07:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
process
 
07:17:56.070 --> 07:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh and how it occurs at nih and i'll
 
07:17:57.830 --> 07:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
just be very i won't go
 
07:18:01.030 --> 07:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'll spare the gory details but this
 
07:18:03.830 --> 07:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
process is not
 
07:18:05.430 --> 07:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
would not fly well
 
07:18:07.270 --> 07:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
and would not end up
 
07:18:09.830 --> 07:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
giving us the result we want
 
07:18:12.230 --> 07:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
both in terms of the quality and the
 
07:18:14.628 --> 07:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
timing and what's required
 
07:18:18.230 --> 07:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:20.150 --> 07:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative canarch and i would add
 
07:18:22.388 --> 07:18:22.398 align:start position:0%
to that that the dhhs does not have the
 
07:18:23.910 --> 07:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
expertise they confirmed they would need
 
07:18:25.750 --> 07:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
to outsource that as well that is not
 
07:18:27.510 --> 07:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
listed in the fiscal note we would
 
07:18:29.270 --> 07:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
likely end up chewing up all of the
 
07:18:32.388 --> 07:18:32.398 align:start position:0%
potential funding in the administrative
 
07:18:35.110 --> 07:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
aspects of trying to do such a program
 
07:18:36.788 --> 07:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
and it's already being done at a much
 
07:18:38.628 --> 07:18:38.638 align:start position:0%
higher level and i think that we should
 
07:18:40.830 --> 07:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
let the higher level continue thank
 
07:18:44.788 --> 07:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
you representative leon
 
07:18:47.750 --> 07:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
leon yes i try to make it nobody speaks
 
07:18:49.350 --> 07:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
french anymore yes
 
07:18:52.628 --> 07:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
lay on the table perfect
 
07:18:55.430 --> 07:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you i i i looked uh i had spoken
 
07:18:56.868 --> 07:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
with some people involved in clinical
 
07:18:59.110 --> 07:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
trial design and it would have taken
 
07:19:00.388 --> 07:19:00.398 align:start position:0%
more money and it would have been the
 
07:19:02.868 --> 07:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
two years so it was not structured the
 
07:19:04.388 --> 07:19:04.398 align:start position:0%
right way even if we were asking the
 
07:19:06.070 --> 07:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
right questions
 
07:19:06.080 --> 07:19:06.868 align:start position:0%
right questions
but

07:19:06.868 --> 07:19:06.878 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:19:08.948 --> 07:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
but well designed the right way maybe
 
07:19:10.468 --> 07:19:10.478 align:start position:0%
something like this in the future but
 
07:19:12.868 --> 07:19:12.878 align:start position:0%
this is not designed at all the right
 
07:19:16.070 --> 07:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
way so i'm ito
 
07:19:18.388 --> 07:19:18.398 align:start position:0%

have
 
07:22:39.910 --> 07:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
we have one mind or do we want to take
 
07:22:39.920 --> 07:22:40.868 align:start position:0%
we have one mind or do we want to take
her

07:22:40.868 --> 07:22:40.878 align:start position:0%

07:22:42.230 --> 07:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
bill remember this is the one that
 
07:22:47.990 --> 07:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:49.830 --> 07:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
07:22:49.840 --> 07:22:50.788 align:start position:0%
right yeah
so

07:22:50.788 --> 07:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:22:53.350 --> 07:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
if i could have an informal
 
07:22:53.360 --> 07:22:54.708 align:start position:0%
if i could have an informal
um

07:22:54.708 --> 07:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:57.590 --> 07:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
i itl is that
 
07:23:03.270 --> 07:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:04.948 --> 07:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
yeah we got some representative kanark
 
07:23:06.150 --> 07:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up
 
07:23:08.708 --> 07:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
well yeah just the old line we do
 
07:23:11.110 --> 07:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
tune-ups not total rebuilds and this is
 
07:23:12.948 --> 07:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
going to be a complete rebuild we will
 
07:23:16.070 --> 07:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
get much more out of supporting sb 277
 
07:23:17.670 --> 07:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
and i think we still should ask them to
 
07:23:18.948 --> 07:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
fast track it so we can get it through
 
07:23:20.948 --> 07:23:20.958 align:start position:0%
the house the senate the house and the
 
07:23:23.110 --> 07:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
governor before may 31st we're going to
 
07:23:24.628 --> 07:23:24.638 align:start position:0%
get a hell of a lot more
 
07:23:25.910 --> 07:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
backing back out of that we're going to
 
07:23:27.990 --> 07:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
get two years and then we can figure out
 
07:23:29.430 --> 07:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
how to he'll deal with a long-standing
 
07:23:31.990 --> 07:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
mental health emergency after that tell
 
07:23:35.670 --> 07:23:35.680 align:start position:0%

07:23:37.750 --> 07:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
that is the current one that except two
 
07:23:40.070 --> 07:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
seven seven that is the one that extends
 
07:23:42.468 --> 07:23:42.478 align:start position:0%

07:23:44.468 --> 07:23:44.478 align:start position:0%

right i got it now
 
07:27:06.548 --> 07:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
and actually probably a good idea to
 
07:27:08.548 --> 07:27:08.558 align:start position:0%
read it first
 
07:27:09.750 --> 07:27:09.760 align:start position:0%

07:27:11.830 --> 07:27:11.840 align:start position:0%

07:27:11.840 --> 07:27:13.190 align:start position:0%
yes well i can also guide people through
it

07:27:13.190 --> 07:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:27:15.910 --> 07:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:16.708 --> 07:27:16.718 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
07:27:18.230 --> 07:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
just to set the background i can explain
 
07:27:21.190 --> 07:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
what it's what it's about
 
07:27:24.788 --> 07:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
i opened the executive session on house
 
07:27:28.150 --> 07:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:30.230 --> 07:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
an act relative to access to language
 
07:27:35.030 --> 07:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:37.510 --> 07:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
our new friend representative murray who
 
07:27:39.910 --> 07:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
is here much of today
 
07:27:41.670 --> 07:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative canuck would you speak to
 
07:27:43.590 --> 07:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
your amendment please and what it does
 
07:27:45.990 --> 07:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
yes sir um basically as you may recall
 
07:27:47.830 --> 07:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
we sort of all agreed with that it
 
07:27:49.510 --> 07:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
sounded reasonable but it's in the wrong
 
07:27:51.590 --> 07:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
place statutorily
 
07:27:53.430 --> 07:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
the statute that it was placed into is
 
07:27:56.468 --> 07:27:56.478 align:start position:0%
the licensed special licensed facilities
 
07:27:58.628 --> 07:27:58.638 align:start position:0%
special healthcare service licenses
 
07:28:00.468 --> 07:28:00.478 align:start position:0%
those are places that do radiation
 
07:28:02.548 --> 07:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
therapy and some other things like that
 
07:28:04.230 --> 07:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't cover hospitals and all that
 
07:28:05.430 --> 07:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff that we really wanted to
 
07:28:07.030 --> 07:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
have covered so i worked with john
 
07:28:08.150 --> 07:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
williams to get the appropriate
 
07:28:09.910 --> 07:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
localization for this
 
07:28:12.948 --> 07:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
and so that the tele sorry the
 
07:28:15.590 --> 07:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
the statute that was placed in was 151
 
07:28:17.030 --> 07:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
to f
 
07:28:18.948 --> 07:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
the one it should be in
 
07:28:21.590 --> 07:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
and there are two paragraphs here
 
07:28:21.600 --> 07:28:22.750 align:start position:0%
and there are two paragraphs here
is

07:28:22.750 --> 07:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:28:22.760 --> 07:28:24.310 align:start position:0%
is
415j3

07:28:24.310 --> 07:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
415j3
 
07:28:26.388 --> 07:28:26.398 align:start position:0%
that is the telemedicine statute that
 
07:28:29.510 --> 07:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
covers insurers including managed care
 
07:28:31.590 --> 07:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
and the other one that's that's section
 
07:28:33.350 --> 07:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
one section two
 
07:28:35.270 --> 07:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
does the medicaid coverage of telehealth
 
07:28:38.708 --> 07:28:38.718 align:start position:0%
services and that's 1674-d
 
07:28:40.310 --> 07:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
both of those are ones where they are
 
07:28:43.110 --> 07:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
statutes about telemedicine that's their
 
07:28:45.750 --> 07:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
topic it covers then
 
07:28:47.430 --> 07:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
07:28:49.750 --> 07:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
facilities and providers
 
07:28:51.430 --> 07:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
but again the only people are required
 
07:28:52.868 --> 07:28:52.878 align:start position:0%
to this are the ones that are required
 
07:28:55.110 --> 07:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
federally to provide translational
 
07:28:55.120 --> 07:28:56.230 align:start position:0%
federally to provide translational
services

07:28:56.230 --> 07:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
services
 
07:28:59.110 --> 07:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
then they would be required to provide
 
07:29:00.708 --> 07:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
those services
 
07:29:03.030 --> 07:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
for people using telemedicine so the
 
07:29:04.388 --> 07:29:04.398 align:start position:0%
idea is since it has to do with
 
07:29:06.548 --> 07:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
telemedicine put it with telemedicine
 
07:29:08.310 --> 07:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to re to actually be
 
07:29:10.628 --> 07:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
talking about the appropriate facilities
 
07:29:12.708 --> 07:29:12.718 align:start position:0%
not just these special licenses so
 
07:29:14.548 --> 07:29:14.558 align:start position:0%
that's all it does is it changes where
 
07:29:16.868 --> 07:29:16.878 align:start position:0%
it hangs out
 
07:29:24.628 --> 07:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:26.628 --> 07:29:26.638 align:start position:0%
i have a question and by the way let me
 
07:29:27.990 --> 07:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
just clarify so
 
07:29:30.070 --> 07:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
sir for example in the original bill
 
07:29:32.708 --> 07:29:32.718 align:start position:0%
section five the bold
 
07:29:32.718 --> 07:29:36.708 align:start position:0%
section five the bold
um

07:29:36.708 --> 07:29:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:38.388 --> 07:29:38.398 align:start position:0%
that that is what that is incorporated
 
07:29:41.910 --> 07:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
because this these are new
 
07:29:43.990 --> 07:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
paragraphs that's why they're not bold
 
07:29:45.750 --> 07:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
07:29:47.270 --> 07:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
so that language about if they're
 
07:29:48.948 --> 07:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
required to ensure access to limited
 
07:29:50.548 --> 07:29:50.558 align:start position:0%
english proficient speakers under blah
 
07:29:52.468 --> 07:29:52.478 align:start position:0%
blah blah you'll notice that that is
 
07:29:54.628 --> 07:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
repetitive between lines five through
 
07:29:58.070 --> 07:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
eight and lines eleven through fourteen
 
07:29:58.080 --> 07:30:00.070 align:start position:0%
eight and lines eleven through fourteen
um

07:30:00.070 --> 07:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:30:01.910 --> 07:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
and uh again it just finishes with the
 
07:30:03.750 --> 07:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
last part of either line eight or line
 
07:30:06.070 --> 07:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
fourteen in person or utilizing
 
07:30:08.230 --> 07:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
telemedicine so the reason it's not
 
07:30:10.388 --> 07:30:10.398 align:start position:0%
bolded in the amendment is because there
 
07:30:11.990 --> 07:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
are new
 
07:30:12.000 --> 07:30:12.868 align:start position:0%
are new
uh

07:30:12.868 --> 07:30:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:30:12.878 --> 07:30:14.150 align:start position:0%
uh
sections

07:30:14.150 --> 07:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
sections
 
07:30:14.160 --> 07:30:15.030 align:start position:0%
sections
in

07:30:15.030 --> 07:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:30:16.788 --> 07:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
415 j3
 
07:30:16.798 --> 07:30:17.990 align:start position:0%
415 j3
and

07:30:17.990 --> 07:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:30:18.000 --> 07:30:22.230 align:start position:0%
and
n1674d

07:30:22.230 --> 07:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:23.750 --> 07:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative cushman did you have a
 
07:30:23.760 --> 07:30:25.270 align:start position:0%
representative cushman did you have a
question

07:30:25.270 --> 07:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:30:27.190 --> 07:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
yes i'm just
 
07:30:29.910 --> 07:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
double triple checking clarification yes
 
07:30:31.830 --> 07:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
so i believe
 
07:30:33.990 --> 07:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
that this is saying that
 
07:30:35.910 --> 07:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh facilities that are already required
 
07:30:37.990 --> 07:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
to have this technology
 
07:30:40.388 --> 07:30:40.398 align:start position:0%
um for in-person
 
07:30:42.548 --> 07:30:42.558 align:start position:0%
are now required to use it or not
 
07:30:45.030 --> 07:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
technology but service are required to
 
07:30:47.670 --> 07:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
use it for telehealth services
 
07:30:47.680 --> 07:30:49.270 align:start position:0%
use it for telehealth services
and

07:30:49.270 --> 07:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:30:51.190 --> 07:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
section two is
 
07:30:51.200 --> 07:30:52.070 align:start position:0%
section two is
just

07:30:52.070 --> 07:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
07:30:53.830 --> 07:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
ensuring that those required by the
 
07:30:56.150 --> 07:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
federal government to provide medicaid
 
07:30:56.160 --> 07:30:57.350 align:start position:0%
federal government to provide medicaid
coverage

07:30:57.350 --> 07:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
07:30:59.110 --> 07:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's being written into state statute
 
07:30:59.120 --> 07:30:59.990 align:start position:0%
it's being written into state statute
also

07:30:59.990 --> 07:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
also
 
07:31:01.430 --> 07:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes because basically what it does is
 
07:31:03.590 --> 07:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's putting it into the statutes for
 
07:31:05.590 --> 07:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
telemedicine in the
 
07:31:05.600 --> 07:31:06.948 align:start position:0%
telemedicine in the
insured

07:31:06.948 --> 07:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
insured
 
07:31:09.270 --> 07:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
population and in the medicaid
 
07:31:11.190 --> 07:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
population and we don't of course
 
07:31:12.948 --> 07:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
control the medicare population that's
 
07:31:14.948 --> 07:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
not ours
 
07:31:16.310 --> 07:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
so basically john
 
07:31:18.388 --> 07:31:18.398 align:start position:0%
john williams just guided us as to where
 
07:31:20.150 --> 07:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
the better placement would be that's all
 
07:31:22.948 --> 07:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
thank you john williams oh he's here oh
 
07:31:25.190 --> 07:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
i didn't even realize he was still here
 
07:31:28.150 --> 07:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
he's always here yes
 
07:31:29.510 --> 07:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
we can ask him if there's anything else
 
07:31:40.468 --> 07:31:40.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:44.830 --> 07:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:47.190 --> 07:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
wind extra copy there should be an extra
 
07:31:52.868 --> 07:31:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:23.990 --> 07:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:27.030 --> 07:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
he said it was perfect too wow
 
07:32:30.708 --> 07:32:30.718 align:start position:0%

07:32:35.350 --> 07:32:35.360 align:start position:0%

the amendment to pass i'm good yeah well
 
07:32:53.510 --> 07:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
all right just you can't i tell an
 
07:33:00.060 --> 07:33:00.070 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:00.070 --> 07:33:08.788 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

07:33:08.788 --> 07:33:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:13.830 --> 07:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:13.840 --> 07:33:17.190 align:start position:0%
 
yes

07:33:17.190 --> 07:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:20.468 --> 07:33:20.478 align:start position:0%
um dr cushman please
 
07:33:22.388 --> 07:33:22.398 align:start position:0%
you're never going to live
 
07:33:22.398 --> 07:33:23.670 align:start position:0%
you're never going to live
nurse

07:33:23.670 --> 07:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
nurse
 
07:33:23.680 --> 07:33:25.030 align:start position:0%
nurse
um

07:33:25.030 --> 07:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:33:25.040 --> 07:33:26.150 align:start position:0%
um
so

07:33:26.150 --> 07:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:33:28.788 --> 07:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just a bit confused of why
 
07:33:30.548 --> 07:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
it's necessary if it's already required
 
07:33:33.590 --> 07:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
by the federal law
 
07:33:33.600 --> 07:33:34.310 align:start position:0%
by the federal law
oh

07:33:34.310 --> 07:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
oh
 
07:33:37.190 --> 07:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
claire you know it's the what it is is
 
07:33:38.230 --> 07:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to make it that
 
07:33:40.468 --> 07:33:40.478 align:start position:0%
absolutely everybody had to provide
 
07:33:43.270 --> 07:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
all these services it's only that if
 
07:33:45.990 --> 07:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
the facility is required under the 45
 
07:33:48.948 --> 07:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
cfr section blah blah blah blah blah to
 
07:33:51.190 --> 07:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
provide these services then they shall
 
07:33:53.430 --> 07:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
also do it if it's in telemedicine in
 
07:33:55.750 --> 07:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
other words if they are are not required
 
07:33:57.270 --> 07:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
07:34:00.388 --> 07:34:00.398 align:start position:0%
the translational access anyway
 
07:34:02.070 --> 07:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
then they would not be required to
 
07:34:04.948 --> 07:34:04.958 align:start position:0%
provide it for telemedicine either it's
 
07:34:06.548 --> 07:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
just to keep it consistent so we're not
 
07:34:07.590 --> 07:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
asking the
 
07:34:09.830 --> 07:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
people who are not required to do it in
 
07:34:11.670 --> 07:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
person would now suddenly be required to
 
07:34:16.548 --> 07:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:19.190 --> 07:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
is there an insurance mandate in here
 
07:34:21.030 --> 07:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
well that is what these both are these
 
07:34:23.030 --> 07:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
are both in the insurance
 
07:34:25.670 --> 07:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's why it's in the telemedicine uh
 
07:34:26.388 --> 07:34:26.398 align:start position:0%
in the
 
07:34:28.150 --> 07:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
for the insured and telemedicine for the
 
07:34:30.070 --> 07:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
medicaid so it is telling them that they
 
07:34:37.510 --> 07:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:40.230 --> 07:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
07:34:42.150 --> 07:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not positive of this but from my
 
07:34:45.750 --> 07:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
experience with providing
 
07:34:47.910 --> 07:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
interpreters in the mental health center
 
07:34:49.990 --> 07:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
where i worked it wasn't the insurance
 
07:34:52.150 --> 07:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
that was mandated to pay for it it was
 
07:34:52.160 --> 07:34:53.430 align:start position:0%
that was mandated to pay for it it was
the

07:34:53.430 --> 07:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:34:55.590 --> 07:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
it was the service provider services
 
07:35:00.150 --> 07:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:04.628 --> 07:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:08.070 --> 07:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:09.830 --> 07:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
so in that case it's
 
07:35:11.430 --> 07:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
a mandate on the
 
07:35:11.440 --> 07:35:13.430 align:start position:0%
a mandate on the
facilities

07:35:13.430 --> 07:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
07:35:15.110 --> 07:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay but they already provide these
 
07:35:16.788 --> 07:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
services anyway because they're required
 
07:35:19.430 --> 07:35:19.440 align:start position:0%

cushman for answering too quickly and
 
07:36:52.310 --> 07:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
being incorrect it it doesn't say that
 
07:36:54.070 --> 07:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's an insurance mandate that was my
 
07:36:56.548 --> 07:36:56.558 align:start position:0%
error it says the facility is required
 
07:36:58.708 --> 07:36:58.718 align:start position:0%
to provide it so it's a service
 
07:37:00.468 --> 07:37:00.478 align:start position:0%
service mandate not an insurance mandate
 
07:37:02.468 --> 07:37:02.478 align:start position:0%
