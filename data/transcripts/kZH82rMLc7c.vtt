motion representative Veil yes Mr chair
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um so house bill was 186 was
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
um filed in order
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
to see if there was a legislative
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
solution that would would help Grafton
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
County to be able to um reduce the
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
amount of the percentage of their um
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
taxes that go toward um the sewer
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
company that they're using right now so
 
00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
25% is a
 
00:20:48.669 --> 00:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
lot um but what we found during the
 
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
hearing was that the legislative
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
solution um does it would impact Other M
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities in a negative
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
way and time to get this changed was not
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
available to the sponsor or to the
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee the bill needs to address to
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
go forward um concerns raised by Dees
 
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
about water quality and also um there
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
was opposition from New Hampshire bir
 
00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Rivers um because of the
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
cyano bacteria blooms and other
 
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
bacterial um infections that happen on
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
our water bodies so we do want them to
 
00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
be able to address the issues that
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
they're having but again this bill has
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
too many negative impacts for us to go
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
forward with it and so we're hoping that
 
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
a non-legislative solution might be more
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
helpful but if not then we could um help
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%

you Mr chair uh I think this bill as
 
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
currently written still has some issues
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
regarding definitions and compilation
 
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
and other problems I also reviewed the
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
record and it appears to me that much of
 
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
what the prime sponsor wish to do can be
 
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
done without a bill and can be easily
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
done by the um Division and so I would
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%

00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%

00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
yesterday that talks about all the
 
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
confusion that has plagued this process
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
beginning with my I'm just I'm quoting
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
beginning with my mistake and
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
identifying the wrong Department to do
 
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
the work and he goes on and
 
00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
mentions that uh while I can dream that
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
the in the future we'll have some
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that the department
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
could use to build out the website as a
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
more robust educational and research
 
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
tool sounds like a great idea he goes on
 
00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:29.559 align:start position:0%
especially with federal dollars he goes
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
on I worked with director Wilson
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
specifically to make this project fit
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
within the work already done by his
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
Department without the need for
 
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
additional resources I I happen to sit
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
on another commission with director
 
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
Wilson and engaged him on this very
 
00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
topic and basically said would you like
 
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
us to pass this bill or not do you need
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
it to do this work are you going to do
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
the work anyways and the answer was
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
indifferent don't need it to do the work
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to do it anyways um
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
because it's something it's part of what
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
we already do so in my view the Bill's
 
00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
not necessary and the work's still going
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
to get done so that's what I have to
 
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
add anyone else wish to speak on the
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
bill rep repres representative Darby
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
Rong thank you Mr chair um in the
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
original testimony we heard how um from
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh from numerous supporters how um the
 
00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.039 align:start position:0%
collection of this information would
 
00:27:26.909 --> 00:27:26.919 align:start position:0%
help um students in the state um and and
 
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
highlight um some of the uh some of the
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
historical um mon monuments that um are
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
are supported or provide or sponsored I
 
00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:40.039 align:start position:0%
guess supported by the local
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities but just not known um by
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
throughout the greater State um in the
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
work session um we talked about I think
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
it was a work session we talked about
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
how um getting broader awareness of
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
those monuments is is in everyone's best
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
interest I definitely appreciate um you
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
know the the director's um desire maybe
 
00:28:05.789 --> 00:28:05.799 align:start position:0%
to to implement this on you know on his
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
own behalf but he hasn't done it yet so
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm skeptical that it'll actually
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
happen without some some
 
00:28:15.149 --> 00:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
encouragement now we know that the um
 
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
that the original Bill had some flaws
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
and so you've seen on the table in front
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
of you an amendment that really
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
addresses a lot of those flaws um I will
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
point out that back in um January the
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
chair um emailed um the committee um an
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
an email from uh the director Benjamin
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
Wilson that he stated um could be read
 
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
into the record and I believe that it
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
was read into the record and
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
specifically it said um I want the
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee to know that I support that I
 
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
and the division of historical resources
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
support the bill have worked with a
 
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor um and that we can accomplish
 
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
the bill without any burden to DHR staff
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
the division of historical resources
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
staff or committing Financial Resources
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
so if the if we if we um if we um fail
 
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
this itl motion don't pass this itm
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
motion and um let another uh motion
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
stand I think we can U make some good
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
progress in this state with historical
 
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
you representative rung for thank you Mr
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
chair stat I Echo what my colleague from
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
nashwa has said um but I also want to
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
bring up a point of order it's seems as
 
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
though all the discussion on this motion
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
is on the amendment which hasn't been
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
introduced yet so um I I'm going to be
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
voting no on the itl motion so that the
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
amendment can be brought forward since
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the topic of discussion
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
and it was the topic when the
 
00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:45.470 align:start position:0%
and it was the topic when the
subcommittee

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:48.919 align:start position:0%

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
as uh as
 
00:29:56.509 --> 00:29:56.519 align:start position:0%
presented uh and the so the uh amendment
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
is not on the the table so uh please uh
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
focus on the bill as uh in the dis this
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%

00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:24.909 align:start position:0%
chairperson
chairman

00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
um the original bill
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
goes to the wrong department and it has
 
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note that consulted with the
 
00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.110 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note that consulted with the
wrong

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
Department I received the email
 
00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
from um the repres from Ben Wilson some
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
time back and went over these things to
 
00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:48.519 align:start position:0%
me they could be addressed in an
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and the subcommittee spent a
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
lot of time discussing what the
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
amendment would look like if it were to
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
be different than and the one that we
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
are about to introduce hopefully on a
 
00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:02.710 align:start position:0%
are about to introduce hopefully on a
different

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:06.039 align:start position:0%
motion um but this is an amendment that
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
was written in January and IT addresses
 
00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
most of the concerns of the bill we feel
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
that it could be restricted to a list
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
and just to say that we didn't hold a
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
vote as a subcommittee because we really
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
didn't make any kind of significant
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
progress on um some of the questions
 
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
that we had so as a followup to that um
 
00:31:26.629 --> 00:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing what we did was
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
send out that list of questions that
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
came up um during the subcommittee and
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
we um got some answers back um long
 
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
after we adjourned that so just to
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
reiterate we did not vote what we did
 
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
was we decided to support the amendment
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
and hope for an overturn of an itl so we
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
could get to the other motion and um
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
talk about where this puts the um the
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
statute in the right area and Consulting
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
the right director of the right agency
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of compiling public
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
monuments um I just mentioned and I'll
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
keep on mentioning that I think um the
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members all agree that
 
00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:17.559 align:start position:0%
history is really important this is part
 
00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:20.519 align:start position:0%
of our lifestyle in New Hampshire the
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
fact that we have a long long history
 
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
that we can go back to we can see all
 
00:32:27.149 --> 00:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
the twists twists and turns that we've
 
00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
taken and all of the people that helped
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
to shape New Hampshire to be what it is
 
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
today for the good and for the bad so um
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
I look forward to hopefully getting on
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
to another motion on this bill and um
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
chair represent repres representative
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
for the second time thank Mr chairman
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring to the committee's
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
attention the director's response to one
 
00:32:59.629 --> 00:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
of our Representatives questions by
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
email um who asked can the Bill's intent
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
be accomplished by rules versus
 
00:33:08.909 --> 00:33:08.919 align:start position:0%
legislation and his answer to that was
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
it all depends on how the project is
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
defined if the nhhr is simply hosting a
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
list of public monuments by town on a
 
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
web page no legislation is
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
needed he goes on to elaborate um about
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
having enabling legislation for an
 
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
administrative rule such as the NH hdhr
 
00:33:29.629 --> 00:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
shall maintain a list of public
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
monuments that would require an
 
00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
amendment to RSA
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
227c yes administrative rules reviewed
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
and adopted every 10
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
years so by my interpretation of this
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%

00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
again is everyone uh everybody ready to
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
go on the discussion of the
 
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
amendment uh representative
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the amendment thank
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
you I realize we've already had some
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
discussion um with the previous motion
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
but I want to reiterate that the flaws
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
that were in the original Bill have been
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
corrected with this amendment um the
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
intent is been placed with the proper
 
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
Department within the state government
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
um we've already heard um through email
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
and um I think phone calls from that uh
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
director of the division that he
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
supports this amend amendment that this
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
is work that he feels is very
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate and would not come at an
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
additional cost um during the
 
00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting we had discussions
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
about some of the terminology that was
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
used like how do we Define monuments but
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
in other areas of the statute historical
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
markers and historical monuments are
 
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
already um defined I I think um we can
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
overthink this too much I think this is
 
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
really just um assigning a
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to a department that's
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate to to them with no added
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
cost it's something that they haven't
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
done yet and getting to representative
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
Darby's comment if they haven't done it
 
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
yet I I'm not sure whether they would do
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
it without having um a bill come before
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
them so I encourage everyone to um
 
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
support this amendment thank
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
you representative Darby for uh talk to
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
you second thank you Mr chair just Bri
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
briefly um the amendment corrects the
 
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill it was um as the uh
 
00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839 align:start position:0%
as the prime sponsor mentioned in his
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
original testimony due to his you know
 
00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.589 align:start position:0%
original testimony due to his you know
his

00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
novice uh uh in introducing the bill he
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
directed at the wrong Department this
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
simply corrects the department which
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately um you know will help with
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
the the financial um justification it's
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
even if you don't support the concept
 
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
supporting the amendment makes sense
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
because it it's it aligns with the
 
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill so I urge you to vote
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
amendment represent representative Vil
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
chair sorry for the delayed response I
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
just remembered that I didn't talk about
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment because I was trying not
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
to talk about the
 
00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
amendment but you did talk about but I
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
talked about them anyway but not as much
 
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:02.839 align:start position:0%
as I would have um so just that this
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
bill um the amendment here it fixes to
 
00:41:10.109 --> 00:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
the division of historical resources and
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
um it's to the correct department we
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
know that this bill can be executed
 
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
without a fiscal note and um we know
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
that time is of the E Essence with
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
history I think about this all the time
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
that when you're 16 17 198 and you're
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
studying history that year that you miss
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
or that
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
that thing that you weren't able to do
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
because the legislature killed it would
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
be something that would stay with you
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
for the rest of your life and history is
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
really important that way because it has
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
like an exponential prop propagation
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
it's really up to us to make sure that
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
we're transmitting our history um in all
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
the ways that we do and to line up with
 
00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
what we say we do here for education in
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I'm really hoping that
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
people will go ahead and vote yay on the
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and vote for a motion to ought
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended and we can send this
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
to the floor and pass it there thank
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
you anyone else wish to speak on the
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
amendment specifically on the
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
amendment uh I the chair would like to
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit on the amendment
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
first of all uh the chair and and the
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
ranking member got into issue on whether
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
on whether or not this bill uh this
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
amendment was actually Germaine because
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
it actually changed the uh uh part of
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
the uh this the part of the statutes
 
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
that uh from the that the that that
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
we've that is that is taken care of this
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
issue it goes from one part of the
 
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
statute to another uh we did uh we went
 
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
did we did uh go to the clerk and who
 
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
consulted the speaker and the speaker
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
ruled that this it is Germain and that
 
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
it is uh it is correcting really a a an
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
error uh in drafting and not uh in and
 
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
not actually making a a change in uh uh
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
in where the where the uh it's going to
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
where it's supposed to go at any rate so
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
it is it is simply an error so that's
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
why it was uh it's being accepted as a
 
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
Germain Amendment uh the ALS also but
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
there there while this
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
amendment does correct that that issue
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
on on who does who is supposed to do the
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
work it really is in still still is
 
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
still incomplete uh for instance uh just
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
looking at it uh uh just cursory it uh
 
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
talks about physical markers of a
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
historical event individual groups uh
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
geographical sites of historical
 
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.790 align:start position:0%
geographical sites of historical
cultural

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
cultural
 
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
significance don't we have a don't we do
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
that right now what is the the uh the
 
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
director of the division of historic
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
resources there are these signs all over
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
about this is a this house or this
 
00:44:33.309 --> 00:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
person was born here or there are there
 
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
are several in front of uh uh in front
 
00:44:40.589 --> 00:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
in front of this these very
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
buildings uh so and those are those
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
lists do are available and there that
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
exists now so it's just it's
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
just uh a a duplication of effort we
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
already we already have it done it's
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
already been done it's already been paid
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
for so at least at least that segment is
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
and so but that's again that's part of
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
the the the the defects that are still
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
in the in the exist in the bill so I
 
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
will be I will be supporting the
 
00:45:16.549 --> 00:45:16.559 align:start position:0%
amendment simply because it does change
 
00:45:23.069 --> 00:45:23.079 align:start position:0%
the uh the the change the uh clerical
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
issue of it this going to the wrong
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
uh division so it's at least at least it
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
will get that in the record
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
so will
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
the uh in that is there any other
 
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
uh this anybody else wish to speak on
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
the on the
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
issue represent representative mchu
 
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
thank Mr chairman just a a quick
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
parliamentary question a true
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
parliamentary question if the amendment
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
fails then the next vote is ought to
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
pass on the original Bill and should we
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
wish to amend it it would have to be
 
00:46:05.309 --> 00:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
done as a floor Amendment
 
00:46:05.319 --> 00:46:09.190 align:start position:0%
done as a floor Amendment
correct

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
yes assuming yeah assume sorry assuming
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
it goes to the floor and the vote goes
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
the way the previous votes did it has to
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
be without recommendation yes okay so it
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
would go without recommendation
 
00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:21.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation and to amend it would
 
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
require a floor Amendment yes to amend
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
the original bill that had all those
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
problems right if this if this bill if
 
00:46:34.829 --> 00:46:34.839 align:start position:0%
this amendment passes this would uh this
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
bill would be the committee's
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
amendment or this amendment would uh uh
 
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:42.559 align:start position:0%
would be the committee
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment so further question so the
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
alternative would be vote down the
 
00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
amendment and it would have to come as a
 
00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.030 align:start position:0%
amendment and it would have to come as a
floor

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%

second representative L Montaine seconds
 
00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:39.559 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion well
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of discussion on this
 
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
we've had a subcommittee and this I just
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate this bill came to us
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
from an esteemed history professor at
 
00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
keing State College who saw the need for
 
00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
this um function as part of state
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
government that could be used and as a
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
resource to students and teachers
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the state I know we get kind
 
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
of caught up in the Weeds about what
 
00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:09.559 align:start position:0%
does this mean what does this mean those
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
in my opinion are minor issues that can
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
be ironed out as the bill if it passes
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
into log gets implemented by the
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
division of historical resources so I
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
think for the good of students and
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
teachers in the state um we should move
 
00:49:26.589 --> 00:49:26.599 align:start position:0%
forward to get this resource available
 
00:49:26.599 --> 00:49:29.589 align:start position:0%
forward to get this resource available
thank

00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
you representative lontine for a speak
 
00:49:34.789 --> 00:49:34.799 align:start position:0%
on a
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
second yeah I'll just briefly add that
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
um it may be true that the division
 
00:49:45.309 --> 00:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
already has lists and and what we're
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
asking in this bill is uh within the
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
purview and scope of the divisions work
 
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
but the key difference is making the
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
list in the survey of available to the
 
00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
public and educational

institutions that's the difference and
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.630 align:start position:0%
it won't really cost any more money to
do

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
do

talked about an a a national competition

where he believes that um a National
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
History competition where he believes
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire students are at a
 
00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
disadvantage because they don't have
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
access uh to resources such as this and
 
00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%

amended representative of wolf thank you
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and there is no cost on
 
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
developing this bill uh well that's
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
what's been stated well let's see why
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
don't we add look let's consult the
 
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
amendment do you see anything in the
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that talks about no costs to
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
this bill did you see it there no
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
however you do have in the original
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
Bill the uh that says there is a cost or
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
at least there is an FN on it so I
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
recommend and I'm going to recommend to
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
the speaker no matter what happens to
 
00:52:39.549 --> 00:52:39.559 align:start position:0%
this bill that it goes to finance
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
because that is on there and we we have
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
we get all we have that says there's no
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
cost to this
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
bill is the words of someone who did not
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
show up on four occasions to tell us
 
00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.910 align:start position:0%
show up on four occasions to tell us
that

00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:03.309 --> 00:53:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
down okay so I once its happenstance
 
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
twice its circumstance three times it's
 
00:53:15.789 --> 00:53:15.799 align:start position:0%
enemy action thank you what four times
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
you tell
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
me at any rate I will believe it when
 
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
Finance tells me that there no cost to
 
00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.349 align:start position:0%
Finance tells me that there no cost to
this

00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
other than that that is why well put it
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
issue that I'm answering your question
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
on that specific issue so there is an FN
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
attached to this bill and it goes along
 
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
with this bill because this amendment is
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
bill so not change that is my question
 
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
is the FN stay with the bill or does it
 
00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
Disappear by having this amendment which
 
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
changes the bill it changes the bill but
 
00:54:06.789 --> 00:54:06.799 align:start position:0%
it does not so I as I see it change any
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
ver any uh anything having to do with
 
00:54:11.119 --> 00:54:12.390 align:start position:0%
ver any uh anything having to do with
the

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh the finances of the bill the bill
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment speaks for itself
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
representative Derby and then
 
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
um we did receive a finan fiscal note
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
for this and it came you know they had
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
consulted the original department on it
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm not questioning I'm definitely
 
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
not questioning the chair in that you
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
know that it would be worthwhile to to
 
00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
get a revised fiscal note but revised
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is definitely warranted
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
because it's a different department and
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
the the office that um that res resolves
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
the fiscal notes would have to consult
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
Department representative thank you Mr
 
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
chair um yes I want to specify that the
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal note as representative Darby said
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
was on the original bill because the
 
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
department that would have assumed this
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility had because this wasn't
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
in their their duties would have to hire
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
someone and that if you go back to the
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
original Bill and look at the fiscal
 
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
note that was the reason the department
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
of archives and Records management would
 
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
have to hire someone to do this but with
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment and this responsibility
 
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:35.559 align:start position:0%
now goes to the division of historical
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
resources they already have the staff to
 
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
do it so on those several occasions
 
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
where the director of historical
 
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
resources has responded by email
 
00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill he stated there is
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
no fiscal note that's going to be
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
required now I'm all for supporting this
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
bill going to finance and for them to
 
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
hear it directly um but our role Now is
 
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
really to vote on the policy that's
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
presented through the amendment the
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
reason there is an FN is that Finance
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
can then weigh in but we can pass this
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
bill as amended and if by some trance
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
there's some fiscal note whether it's a
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
dollar $100 or whatever we're going to
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
learn that from Finance anyway and the
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
bill will come back so I think what our
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
duty is now is to um vote on what the
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is which is to
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
compile a comprehensive list of
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
historical information that students and
 
00:56:38.349 --> 00:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
teachers throughout the state can access
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
and to keep more importantly to make
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
years representative M then represent
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative har thank you Mr chairman
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
I think perhaps now when I look back at
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
the original bill and see that it
 
00:56:57.549 --> 00:56:57.559 align:start position:0%
mentions division of archives and
 
00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
records and the amendment is directed at
 
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
director Wilson's division of historical
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
resources that could be why he didn't
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
didn't turn up initially until he was
 
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
involved in the
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
conversation via
 
00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
email um so my perspective on this bill
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
has changed a little bit in that it's he
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
said he he's going to have a staffer
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
send an email
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
to compile this list it's not a big
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
fancy website and I'm confident that
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
finance will figure it out if it is and
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
if there's a cost they'll attach that
 
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
cost so it's a good idea to have the
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I agree with that but as the
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
amendment's written it's a
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's say harmless but it's it's a it's
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
not that impactful because they plan to
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
already and they say they they say they
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
have the staff and potentially it's a
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
resource for for
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
educators I mean I agree there are still
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
a few problems in terms of defining some
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
of these specific things but I I'm
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
itative Har um thank you Mr chair again
 
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to Repeat based upon director
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
Wilson's email that uh I don't believe
 
00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
we should pass a legislation that's not
 
00:58:22.349 --> 00:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
necessary required and since it's been
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
brought up a number of times in this
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
discussion the bill as amended says
 
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
every 10 years I think the director will
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
do it more frequently than every 10
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
years and it doesn't need to be in
 
00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
you anyone else wish to speak on the uh
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
bill only a few only a few
 
00:58:50.829 --> 00:58:50.839 align:start position:0%
things I will speak on a couple of
 
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
things there are more many things
 
00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
there's no definition of at all of
 
00:58:58.109 --> 00:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
monument I don't where maybe there's
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
something in there it is in in statute
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
it is not in this bill
 
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
the much of the much of what's being
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
asked to go in this in
 
00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
this in this bill already exists in
 
00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
other forms so the nobody's being denied
 
00:59:20.359 --> 00:59:22.190 align:start position:0%
other forms so the nobody's being denied
any

00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
information uh there are
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
things that are of Great Value but it
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have markers or
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
monuments one of the greatest things of
 
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
value we have is the Hall of flags
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
should that be
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
here I would think
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
so is there a marker a monument when it
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
or is that in of itself a monument is
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
monument you got to have to Define
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
things and when someone when a when
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
someone a division a director
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
says oh well I can find somebody to do
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
it well what is that person doing
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
now if that person is
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
not that that's that especially when you
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
could start making that statement in
 
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
front of Finance first thing I think
 
01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
they would go say well what are you
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
doing now with with the money that what
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
is that person doing now and are you
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
going to have to increase that person's
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
work or is that person not being used
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
appropriately those are all questions
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
that usually that's why you have a
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
financial thing and that's why it's it's
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
just supposed to be
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
discussed it should be discussed we
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we shouldn't be putting
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
together a an amend a a law that has too
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
many questions in it and this has too
 
01:00:55.029 --> 01:00:55.039 align:start position:0%
many questions it is
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's too it's where we where you get in
 
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
trouble with statutes is when there's no
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
no there's a a lack of
 
01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.710 align:start position:0%
no there's a a lack of
definity

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
definity
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
and laws get laws get get on the books
 
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
that people say well that isn't what we
 
01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:15.559 align:start position:0%
should be doing but eventually that's
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
what happens we need specificity this
 
01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:22.039 align:start position:0%
this there is there is definitely a
 
01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
requirement for more work to this
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
Bill not I'm against it not but that's
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
that again that's my uh that's my
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
position represent representative Spire
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
hi uh in in the amendment it says that
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
every uh 10 years the director of
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
division of historical resources shall
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
work with local communities throughout
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
the state and it seems to me that it's
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
the local communities that will that
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
will decide what is a monument and what
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
is not we have a lot of monuments at the
 
01:01:59.069 --> 01:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
state level and some formal monuments
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
around but local communities made toine
 
01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:05.319 align:start position:0%
monuments it I think they're free to
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
Define them as they choose and that's
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
what would go on the list so I don't
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
know that you have to Define everything
 
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
so much as allow the local communities
 
01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:17.799 align:start position:0%
to Define what they feel is important
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
just a comment okay but uh I think we've
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
had uh enough debate on Up For the First
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
Time representative Don thank you chair
 
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
um I have just a quick question uh
 
01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
regarding this if the director of the
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
the division of historical resources um
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
does not do this is there any
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
consequence doesn't is if he doesn't do
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
the every 10 years if he doesn't make
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
the email if he doesn't follow the bill
 
01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
what's the consequence of him not doing
 
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
this there's no there's nothing in this
 
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
bill that says there there's no
 
01:02:53.549 --> 01:02:53.559 align:start position:0%
consequence for him to do do this so
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's still up to him correct me if I'm
 
01:02:57.309 --> 01:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
wrong whether or not he chooses to do
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
this going back to the original
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
statement of saying this will force him
 
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
to do this he still has the choice not
 
01:03:05.069 --> 01:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
to do this if he doesn't have the
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
correct that's that is
 
01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:16.839 align:start position:0%
a there's there
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
is precedence for people not doing
 
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
what's been asked of the of of them to
 
01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
do in statute but then we have the
 
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
ability to go try to get that taken care
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
of there is a hierarchy in the executive
 
01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:35.240 align:start position:0%
branch for that there are people from
 
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
the executive branch but I I won't ask
 
01:03:40.829 --> 01:03:40.839 align:start position:0%
you that question if we tell you if you
 
01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
if there's something in a statute and
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
you don't do it what happens
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
well I think I know I think we already
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
know I won't ask that that I won't but
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
that's about the best answer I think I
 
01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:56.039 align:start position:0%
can give represent resentative Derby for
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
State all I was going to say is that
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's where the judici judicial branch
 
01:04:04.349 --> 01:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
um resolves disputes between the um
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
legislative and the executive
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%

love to have a few more leads on other
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
markers that may not be one of the state

bill comes down down to the floor this
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
is going to be the committee Amendment
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
do we have to speak to the bill as it
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
was written and then get the
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
amendment no usually it'll it will it
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
will be the same way any other bill goes
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
to the floor it goes to the floor as uh
 
01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
ought to pass uh but you there is you
 
01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
there is always a second vote on the
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
amendment but usually that's a uh that's
 
01:08:24.239 --> 01:08:25.349 align:start position:0%
amendment but usually that's a uh that's
a

01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
that's you know the if you notice the
 
01:08:28.239 --> 01:08:29.789 align:start position:0%
that's you know the if you notice the
first

01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
vote in uh it comes to the speaker is an
 
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
ought it's an ought to pass and then
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
there and then you there's a vote on
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
this on the committee Amendment so this
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
is the committee of M Mr Mr chairman
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
thank you that clarifies parliamentary
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
clarification on that I I I believe the
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
first vote on the floor of the house is
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
on the committee report which is now
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended right with the
 
01:08:55.229 --> 01:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
the approved committee amendment was
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
passed here so the first vote on the
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
floor I believe is ought to pass as
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
amended after that passes or fails it
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
would be open to further Amendment or
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
further motion if it failed right so the
 
01:09:10.749 --> 01:09:10.759 align:start position:0%
the vote is O the the floor vote is OTP
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
as amended it's it's actually a vote on
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
the committee report yeah but I think
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
you he's stuck in the middle is a uh
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
well it's it's open to further right
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
open to further Amendment once this
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
passes but we have to this the committee
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
report would have to be
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
defeated first or acted on I should say
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
acted on first but the committee report
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass as Amendment correct so
 
01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
so you could it could be if it passes
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's open to further Amendment if it
 
01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
fails it's open to another motion yeah
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
which could be anything
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
okay that answer your question it does
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
it actually answers my question because
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
I was wondering what representative
 
01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
Run's committee report would look like
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
should it look like the bill B and are
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
we allowed to address the amendment in
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
the committee report so that we can get
 
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay unless it goes to the floor as a 10
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
to 10 but we don't have a 10 to 10 here
 
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
anymore okay great just a lot of mental
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
okay okay that's we're done okay we uh
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
Minority Report is me anything
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
398 chair
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Vale who is
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
the chair of the
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%

Bill thank you Mr
 
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
chair um as we we met um we went over
 
01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.110 align:start position:0%
chair um as we we met um we went over
the

01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
amendment we wanted to make sure that um
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
the warning
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
about p is consistent throughout the
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
language we didn't wanted to make sure
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
that a notification didn't stray from
 
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
language that the federal government is
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
using and so there was an agreed upon
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
um I think our vote was four to zero
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
one sent uh one word that this primary
 
01:11:24.669 --> 01:11:24.679 align:start position:0%
sponsor wanted to
 
01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:26.679 align:start position:0%
change but we really talked that through
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
and decided that um it's okay to just
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
continue to call them substances and not
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily chemicals at this stage of
 
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
the game so we would want to continue to
 
01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.550 align:start position:0%
the game so we would want to continue to
do

01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
that um so basically I will let um
 
01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:41.990 align:start position:0%
that um so basically I will let um

01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
alerting the intent of the notification
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%

you Mr
 
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
chair um so we heard during the original
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
testimony from the uh director of the
 
01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
division of U Parks and Rec how um they
 
01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:52.639 align:start position:0%
were concerned that this bill may lead
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
to to um disturbances of the public
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
trying to use the the parks um and
 
01:20:02.189 --> 01:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
really um uh subverting the expectation
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
of a quiet experience as they're parking
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
and recreate um hiking and recreating um
 
01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
in the Parks um they also uh found some
 
01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
concerns with some of the language in
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
the bill itself for example um that the
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
intent um of uh the
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
intent um of disturbing the public was
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
was not enforceable um and they pointed
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
out that there is an existing permitting
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
process for special uh for special use
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
commercial uses um that that exists and
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
that um that UAV uh operators can use
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire aabon um Society also
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
expressed concerns that this would lead
 
01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
to the use of uh amateur operators um
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
and disturbing sensitive spe uh species
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
in particular leading potentially
 
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
leading to birds abandoning their nest
 
01:20:54.669 --> 01:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
nests and finally we also heard from the
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
Department of uh Transportation
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics who said that the um the
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
language in the original bill um was not
 
01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
in line with um the um Aeronautics uh
 
01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:07.639 align:start position:0%
language um from from other parts of
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
statue um and expressed some concerns
 
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
about um uh Landing in um costs for
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
landing in emergency situations as well
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
as um uh as well as uh the some terms in
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
there with use of the airspace and that
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
that not actually regulated by the state
 
01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
um altogether the the bill is um has
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
many concerns for the use of our our our
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
precious natural spaces and um and as as
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
drafted is is really not ready for um to
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
be passed so I urge itl on House Bill
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
you is would you like to speak you like
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
to speak to your a
 
01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
second um yes thank
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
you so this is the second time this
 
01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
matter has come before us and I want to
 
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
say that it's heading in the right
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
direction because we are talking about
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
specific uses um in specific parts of
 
01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
the park system um looking to me I'm
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
really happy to see within the amendment
 
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
that the Canon Mountain ski area during
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
operating hours so there's some of
 
01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
voidance of safety problems that we
 
01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:26.149 align:start position:0%
voidance of safety problems that we
could

01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
foresee um when frankon and Notch is
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
really mobbed with tourists so I do
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
think that a lot of work happened on the
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
first bill this one was the second bill
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and it has some better features in it
 
01:22:43.229 --> 01:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
we talked about how they do this in
 
01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
other states and we talked about that so
 
01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:47.639 align:start position:0%
last week we had the state parks
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
advisory commission hearing the um and
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
also known as
 
01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
spec and the people that attend are
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um in the park system uh
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
there are people from Industries um like
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
the ohvs and people that run um the
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
state park at Hampton Beach so you're
 
01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
really thinking about a broad swath of
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
different kinds of parks that we have
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
their concerns were that you know they
 
01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
just they feel like they're some of this
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
could be um addressed in Ru making
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
Authority but the other thing that they
 
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
wanted you know was maybe more reason
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
why we would need to do this in light of
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that you can get a a temporary
 
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
use permit um but anyway to just make a
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
long story short there wasn't a lot of
 
01:23:41.709 --> 01:23:41.719 align:start position:0%
appetite for this at the State Park
 
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
advisory committee and they did raise um
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
some questions that should be addressed
 
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
such as um where what states are doing
 
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
this and how are they doing it
 
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
successfully they want to see what the
 
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
impact would
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
be probably in advance of venturing into
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
having drones or uavs in state park so
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
second anyone else wish to speak on the
 
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
motion representative m sorry I'm
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
confused the motion is itl right it
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
sounded like the representative was
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
speaking on on an amendment that I
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
didn't know whether I didn't think it
 
01:24:31.629 --> 01:24:31.639 align:start position:0%
was offered yet that is
 
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
true there is a there there would have
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
to be a a repeat of the
 
01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:39.400 align:start position:0%
amendment excuse me a defeated of the
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
motion in order to be able to take up
 
01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.270 align:start position:0%
motion in order to be able to take up
the

01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
you that probably should not have
 
01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
discussed the amendment
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
no um my apologies for that that was out
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
of order um I think I could have made it
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
more simple by just saying that the work
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's being done is going in the right
 
01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
direction and it is being taken
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
seriously but it's not ready yet and
 
01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%

the floor is it
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
yes it is so if the majority of the

is going to the floor as in expediate to
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
legislate so I'm not really sure when
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to bring the amendment
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%

amendment to uh House Bill 472 which is
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment number uh
 
01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:27.750 align:start position:0%
the amendment number uh
2023

01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
2023
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
2284 and the chair recognizes
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative rung to speak that that
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
is your amendment is it not speak to the
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
amendment uh the non- gerain amendment
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
and the re the reason that it is
 
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
considered non- gerain is because it
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
uses a different uh portion different
 
01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
portion of the of the statutes to uh
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
correct the issue so by definition it is
 
01:30:58.550 --> 01:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
non jban according to the clerk and the
 
01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.629 align:start position:0%

01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
01:31:04.189 --> 01:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
so be that the case that's what we're
 
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
here for we're to have the public this
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
is the public hearing on uh on this this
 
01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr chair um if we go
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
back in our memory to when this bill
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
first came before
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
resources um the prime sponsor
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative Crawford brought it
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
Forward at a constituent request the
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
constituent was very concerned that a
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
temporary dock was um jeopardizing the
 
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
nesting location of loons and during the
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing we heard from many people
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for not bringing my
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
notes from that executive session I mean
 
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
that public hearing with me but we heard
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
from several people who said that Lon
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
nests need to be
 
01:31:55.390 --> 01:31:55.400 align:start position:0%
protected um that temporary dogs or
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
other structures can um uh limit alon's
 
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
ability to return to that nest because
 
01:32:05.709 --> 01:32:05.719 align:start position:0%
they always return to the same nest so
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
there there was still some question
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
about whether the intent was going to be
 
01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
accomplished through that bill so during
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
the summer I know representative Darby
 
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
met with fishing game I met with the
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
Loon Conservation Commission along or
 
01:32:23.550 --> 01:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
the lon conservation committee along
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
with representative Crawford and um lo
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
and behold that we already see that in
 
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
statute there is a law that allows Fish
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
and Game to restrict boat traffic when
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
it is um threatening a nesting location
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
of an endangered species so this is
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
exactly the legislative intent but we in
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
addition to boats we need to include
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
other temporary we need to include
 
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
temporary structures like temporary
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
docks or um what I don't know if any of
 
01:32:58.990 --> 01:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
You' have seen these on lakes now but
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
they have these big Inflatables that
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
come up it could be um like a rock
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
climbing wall could be a giant slide but
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
these are are Inflatables that are kept
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
up during the season in lakes and um we
 
01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
want so instead of drafting new
 
01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
legislation in a new area of Statute
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
that would restrict temporary dock
 
01:33:24.669 --> 01:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
from threatening when when they're in a
 
01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
position of threatening an endangered
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
species Nest we just want to uh amend
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
current statute that would Now read the
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
executive director May adopt and enforce
 
01:33:39.109 --> 01:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
rules temporarily restricting boat
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
traffic that's already in law but we
 
01:33:44.669 --> 01:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
would add or the use of temporary
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
seasonal docks and anchored seasonal
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
platforms so it would just expand Fish
 
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
and Game executive director to be able
 
01:33:55.709 --> 01:33:55.719 align:start position:0%
to make judgments on whether those
 
01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
structures or not are um uh would if the
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
director would deem necessary to protect
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
any threatened or endangered species of
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
wildlife in the earliest stages of life
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
so um I believe you know uh
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative Derby could speak to the
 
01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
feedback he's had from fishing game but
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
this is something that is strongly
 
01:34:19.629 --> 01:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
supported by the prime sponsor
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
representative Carol from Molton Boro
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Crawford I'm sorry
 
01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
from molteno and also um The Loon
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
conservation committee as per my
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.629 --> 01:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
director any other discussion on the on
 
01:34:42.669 --> 01:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment representative Darby thank
 
01:34:46.109 --> 01:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so I did speak on several
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh occasions to um commissioner price of
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
the fishing game um Department um
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
def I believe that we have a fishing
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
game representative here as well um the
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know as was testified at the um at
 
01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
the work session Vision game is um I
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say they're in favor
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily of this however um and the
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
the language says may um adopt adopt an
 
01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
enforce rules and as was pointed out
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
during the work session and I confirmed
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
they have not adopted any um any rules
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
restricting boat traffic however what
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
has happened and this is very important
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
is that the lon conservation committee
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
has um has worked in conjunction I guess
 
01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
I'd say with fishing game and put up um
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%
some notices to restrict um boat traffic
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
in very sensitive areas um and they did
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
it basically because of the enabling
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislation which is which is what is
 
01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
being amended here which is what is
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
being updated here and so this um the
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
lon conservation committee is obviously
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
um committed to to preserving you know
 
01:36:04.669 --> 01:36:04.679 align:start position:0%
an iconic species in our state um and
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
they they are well aware that um
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
bringing attention to Lun Nest is not
 
01:36:13.709 --> 01:36:13.719 align:start position:0%
always the the best um option in fact it
 
01:36:15.390 --> 01:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes it draws attention on the
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
other hand they um they use um they
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
apparently have have used that the
 
01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
existing legislation to to help protect
 
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
the loons and this I believe strongly
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
believe that this legislation this
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
modification with respect to uh
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
temporary seasonal docks and uh anchored
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
seasonal platforms would um would give
 
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
them more um encouragement to protect
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
loons in these areas as well as they see
 
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
fit in conjunction with fishing game so
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
even if we hear in a minute that fishing
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
game is not going to Draft rules rules
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
to support um you know to um to to sort
 
01:36:59.070 --> 01:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
of enforce this themselves it will
 
01:37:01.709 --> 01:37:01.719 align:start position:0%
really enable I believe the lon uh
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
conservation committee um preservation
 
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
committee sorry to um to um provide
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
better support to um uh better um sort
 
01:37:16.109 --> 01:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
of safety for Lon nests um and as we
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
heard in the original testimony 50% of
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
Lun Nest fail so it is it is this is
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
important um this is an important bill
 
01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
um to continue to restore this this um
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
this great bird throughout our state
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
much repres representative
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
Veil thank you Mr chair just to be
 
01:37:43.589 --> 01:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
brief I watch the loons every summer on
 
01:37:46.189 --> 01:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
the Loon preservation committee's Lon
 
01:37:46.199 --> 01:37:47.790 align:start position:0%
the Loon preservation committee's Lon
Cam

01:37:47.790 --> 01:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
Cam
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
and I just think this bill is perfect
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
does it is amended and it allows the
 
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
birds to defend their nests from normal
 
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
predators and not from human activity um
 
01:38:04.109 --> 01:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
maybe we could get that nesting success
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
rate up if we're not so disruptive on
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
the shoreline where they do Nest um and
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
if you watch the lon cam you can just
 
01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
see all the things that they have to
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
face between storms and wake boats and
 
01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
the things that kind of wash out their
 
01:38:20.830 --> 01:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
nest it's um incredible to watch them
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
fight for what they have and so I'm glad
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
that we're backing them up here um on
 
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
this bill in this committee because I
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
think it is a significant change to um
 
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
allow the Loon preservation committee to
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
continue its really good work and work
 
01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
that it's done in concert with the state
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
not against the state but with the
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
state I remind the members of the
 
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
committee we are talking about the
 
01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
amendment and not on the bill uh being
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:53.669 align:start position:0%
that said is there any other comments on
