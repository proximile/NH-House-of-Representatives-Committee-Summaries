sorry
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
um so uh in this amendment I've tried to
 
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
include as much of the uh commentary and
 
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
discussion that we got on that we had uh
 
00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
when we did our work session
 
00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:25.550 align:start position:0%
when we did our work session
um

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:30.980 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks ago uh and uh there are
 
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
with the Proviso that I also was in
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
contact with
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm not uh representatives from
 
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
stakeholders uh on uh on several sides
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
of the issue uh including
 
00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:52.019 align:start position:0%
representatives from uh the
 
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
um North Country
 
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
um Alliance for balance change and uh
 
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
representative from the solid waste
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
industry and uh and represent and uh
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
through third parties uh representatives
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
from Des and uh and uh with Senator
 
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.850 align:start position:0%
from Des and uh and uh with Senator
Waters

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
Waters
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
um and uh I was getting advice about uh
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
what may or may not be acceptable to the
 
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:24.860 align:start position:0%
other body and
 
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there were several issues
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
that I really wanted to address in this
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
that would not be acceptable to the
 
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
other body and those were not those are
 
00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339 align:start position:0%
not included in the amendment uh that
 
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
one of those would be on the
 
00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:44.459 align:start position:0%
variability of the time of travel over
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
the site and uh the idea that uh the
 
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
only down gradient
 
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.389 align:start position:0%
only down gradient
um

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
groundwater would be recognized the
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
ground down water gradient issue is not
 
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.030 align:start position:0%
ground down water gradient issue is not
as

00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
significant because that's part of the
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
findings rather than part of the
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
legislation itself I was also not able
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
to get the idea that uh
 
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
the consultant should look at the state
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
laws in in other states
 
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.650 align:start position:0%
laws in in other states
um

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
and I regret that I wasn't able to get
 
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
those but uh what I did manage to get
 
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
was I'll start with um
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page one uh there was
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
this is at the end of the uh section
 
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
that discusses uh measures that could be
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
used to
 
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
um to improve to change the time of
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
travel measurement uh uh or or the the
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
ultimate distance away from a water body
 
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
um the there was discussion committee
 
00:11:57.769 --> 00:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
that uh section B was uh
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
not what was very difficult to interpret
 
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
just for uh language reasons and I
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
worked on rewriting that uh and uh so
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
that now reads like the permit
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
application includes any measure
 
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:13.940 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 149
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
m915a and the department relies on such
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
a measure uh in the Department's
 
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
formulation of the site's specific
 
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.930 align:start position:0%
formulation of the site's specific
setback

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
required by RSA
 
00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019 align:start position:0%
149 M7 3A the department shall include
 
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
such a measure as a condition to the
 
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
permit and I think this actually makes
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
that uh that requirement that any
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
measure that gets uh
 
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh used to change the uh the ultimate
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
setback needs to be specifically
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
included as a condition for the permit
 
00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
and uh so that
 
00:12:55.139 --> 00:12:56.030 align:start position:0%
and uh so that
um

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
that was one change uh
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
the uh next change is uh
 
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.269 align:start position:0%
the uh next change is uh
the

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
um uh conflicts of influence conflict of
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
interest language uh it was pointed out
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
that to me that the way that we had it
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
set up previously was in some sense
 
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
circular and uh would actually end up
 
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:21.860 align:start position:0%
only applying to a solid waste company
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
whereas what we actually wanted to uh
 
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
the place where we want to prevent the
 
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest is with the
 
00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:35.579 align:start position:0%
consultant so uh we uh and it was also
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
pointed out that there exists in statute
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
already a conflict conflict of interest
 
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
language uh and I don't remember the
 
00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:44.459 align:start position:0%
citation right now but
 
00:13:44.459 --> 00:13:45.110 align:start position:0%
citation right now but
um

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
I can find it if anyone later if
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
anyone's interested the department shall
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
include in a request for proposals
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
Provisions designed to prevent a
 
00:13:54.889 --> 00:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
situation circumstance or financial
 
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
interest which has the reasonable
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
potential to cause a prospective
 
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
contractor's interest to interfere with
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
the contractor's duties under the
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
request for proposals and require
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
disclosure in the response
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
to the request for proposal submission
 
00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:14.579 align:start position:0%
by the Consulting form firm okay there's
 
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
a typo here that we will need to
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
um get fixed but the consulting firm or
 
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
individual uh so uh I think that
 
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
actually does a pretty good job of
 
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
laying out what potential conflicts of
 
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
interests are and um and that uh they
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:36.250 align:start position:0%
need to be
um

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:36.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
that that uh that's something that the
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
department has to be careful of uh and
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh also added to uh in line 33 below
 
00:14:52.009 --> 00:14:52.019 align:start position:0%
that uh when the uh consultant
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
um sends in their response their um
 
00:14:59.329 --> 00:14:59.339 align:start position:0%
proposal for uh to the for the RFP that
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
proposal needs to disclose any potential
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
infant uh potential conflicts of
 
00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:05.689 align:start position:0%
infant uh potential conflicts of
interest

00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:06.290 align:start position:0%
interest
um

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.910 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
uh so that conflict of interest language
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
was something that the committee felt uh
 
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
needed to be solidly and in place and I
 
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
think that this language does that
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
um the next uh another issue that we had
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
was that we wanted to have the report
 
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
sent directly to us and that language is
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
at line 35 to 37. the department shall
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
provide the Senate energy and natural
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
resources Committee in the house
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee
 
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
with electronic copies of the report and
 
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
shall we make and and as it said before
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
it should also be on the website
 
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.670 align:start position:0%
it should also be on the website
um

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
and uh the next
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh section that uh where there's a
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
change is
 
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.069 align:start position:0%
change is
um

00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
the creation of an extension and this
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
um rather complicated to negotiate uh
 
00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:04.069 align:start position:0%
um rather complicated to negotiate uh
and

00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
um it ended up
 
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.769 align:start position:0%
um it ended up
um

00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
the way that we had that I had it in the
 
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:13.019 align:start position:0%
previous draft uh did not uh pass muster
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
with OLS because they said that there
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
was a
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
um separation of powers issue with the
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
way it was written and then it could
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
potentially create a precedent that
 
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
would be problematic
 
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
uh so uh uh it's gone through a couple
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
of rewrites since then including one
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
um that happened between nine and ten
 
00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
this morning uh and uh so the the way
 
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
that reads now is if the department is
 
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
this is on page three line 29. if the
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
department is unable to complete
 
00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:50.459 align:start position:0%
adoption of the rules as required
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
under this section as a result of a
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
natural disaster civil emergency
 
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
epidemic or pandemic pandemic or other
 
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstance substantially
 
00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:01.019 align:start position:0%
interfering with the customary operation
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
of the department or state government
 
00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:05.579 align:start position:0%
the commissioner May file for a waiver
 
00:17:10.809 --> 00:17:10.819 align:start position:0%
to extend the deadline under RSA 541 A40
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
Roman 4. during such time the abeyance
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
of approval of applications as outlined
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
in subparagraph B of this
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
section shall continue in effect for no
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
more than 90 days
 
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:27.419 align:start position:0%
and we also increased the amount of
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
money available to the department to
 
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
hire the consultant from 150 000 to 200
 
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
000. so those are the changes and uh
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
in terms of what what I think is really
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
important here I think that is very
 
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
important that we have an advance for uh
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh in place either until the rules are
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
made essentially until the rules are
 
00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
made and uh I am hoping that the
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
department will be able to do that
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
within the scheduled amount of time and
 
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
I'm confident that they have that
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
ability uh and I think that that Advance
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
is really critical uh because I don't
 
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
um we should have any permits going
 
00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:15.539 align:start position:0%
forward under the current rules and if
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
we don't get this amendment in place and
 
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
we don't get the
 
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.409 align:start position:0%
we don't get the
um

00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
get this bill passed then the current
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
rules will take effect as soon as this
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
bill fails uh that is for me that's the
 
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
00:18:33.169 --> 00:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
will be happy to see the discussion to
 
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.370 align:start position:0%
will be happy to see the discussion to
others

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
seeing none of Representative germanna
 
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I want to
 
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank representative Bixby for all the
 
00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
hard work that he's done in
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative Murray and others
 
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.529 align:start position:0%
representative Murray and others
um

00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:54.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'll have more to say when we get to to
 
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
vote on the the whole bill later on I'll
 
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
just add at this point that for me the
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
inability to add language about
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
variability across the site
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately is the straw that's going to
 
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
break the camel's back in terms of my
 
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
ability to vote for this bill or not so
 
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
I want to appreciate express my
 
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.570 align:start position:0%
I want to appreciate express my
appreciation

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
appreciation
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
but also my Supreme disappointment that
 
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
that wasn't
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
um we weren't able to get that added to
 
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
any other discussion about this
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Howard
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you to
 
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee on both
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle who work to make this
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
amendment the best it could be under
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
these under the circumstances I intend
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
to vote for the amendment because it
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
moves us closer to being able to protect
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire from
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
present and future toxins leaching from
 
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
landfills it has not gone far enough
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
though and I believe it this is due to
 
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
the process by which it was formed early
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
on the parameters were defined by A
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
Veiled Threat from the executive branch
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
then during negotiations
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
a representative from of the industry
 
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
most affected by this bill sat in to
 
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
basically confirm that the threat was
 
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
real I'm new at this political stuff
 
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.289 align:start position:0%
real I'm new at this political stuff
and

00:20:12.289 --> 00:20:12.299 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's a good thing because
 
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
I still believe that we must put people
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
before Prophets to me stringent
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
regulation of industries that can show
 
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
the pollutants that threaten our
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
communities is the purview solely of
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
this committee and we should be able to
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
do our jobs unhindered by influences
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Howard
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh as for me I will be supporting this
 
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
amendment and I will be supporting this
 
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.450 align:start position:0%
amendment and I will be supporting this
bill

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
number one if this is something we have
 
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
been discussing for the past six years
 
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to see something done about
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
this uh citing landfills I think with
 
00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:54.419 align:start position:0%
Des not uh with with des's rules
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
expiring next year
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
I believe that with this bill
 
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
they will at least have another set of
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
eyes helping them develop new rules
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
and I think that that would be a good
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
thing and a good step forward
 
00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:12.230 align:start position:0%
thing and a good step forward
so

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
um if anything
 
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:16.820 align:start position:0%
I think that this is that's a favorable
 
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
part of this of this bill that's before
 
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.230 align:start position:0%
part of this of this bill that's before
us

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins thank you madam
 
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.029 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins thank you madam
chair

00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
with respect I appreciate the work that
 
00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
went into this amendment I think there
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
are some pieces of it that
 
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
needed to be part of it that I lament
 
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
did not become part of the amendment to
 
00:21:41.409 --> 00:21:41.419 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
respectfully I have to vote no to this
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
amendment because I think those features
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
were critical to protect the people of
 
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
verbal thank you madam chair I I'm also
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
going to vote no on this amendment I I
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
don't believe that the Department of
 
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services actually needs
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
the help of some third-party consultant
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to promulgate rules relative
 
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
to landfill citing in New Hampshire we
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
have uh highly trained professionals
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
with very good pedigrees and I'm quite
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
certain that they can do their their job
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
without knowing who this third party
 
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
consultancy is to be it's impossible to
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
know which way they would lean whether
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
it be towards industry that would anger
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
some or whether it would be towards
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
strict environmental control which would
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
which would anger others and uh so for
 
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
for that reason I can't support the
 
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you madam chair thank
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%

00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:12.539 align:start position:0%
I believe there's another amendment
 
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:15.980 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza would you like to
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
00:24:23.529 --> 00:24:23.539 align:start position:0%
yeah so I don't know what the exact uh
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
procedure is that I adopt yes I'd like
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
to adopt the amendment which would be
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza would you like to
 
00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:42.299 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
00:24:42.299 --> 00:24:46.610 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
yes

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:48.419 align:start position:0%
so I have a short opening statement
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
before I explain the substance in the
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
minor but critical changes that
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
my Amendment with my co-sponsor makes to
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
SB 61.
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
I was saddened to find out that members
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
of this committee run Amendment changes
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
by Des and Casella for approval
 
00:25:09.169 --> 00:25:09.179 align:start position:0%
furthermore I was even more upset to
 
00:25:12.169 --> 00:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
realize to the extent to which this has
 
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
occurred with SB 61.
 
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:17.220 align:start position:0%
Mr Demers and his client Casella have
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
become the gatekeeper for this
 
00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.090 align:start position:0%
become the gatekeeper for this
legislation

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
they have been allowed to dictate and
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
direct SB 61 by approving or not
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
approving languages in this bill call me
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
new call me naive call me whatever you
 
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
want but I will not sit silently because
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
it is all wrong
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
when we listen to paid lobbyist actors
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
like Casella over the real New Hampshire
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholders you know the citizens that
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
we represent
 
00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
you have to speak up and you have to put
 
00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:49.130 align:start position:0%
you have to speak up and you have to put
up

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
hence why I have introduced the Potenza
 
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
Haskins Amendment
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
the legislature overwhelmingly voted for
 
00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
HP 56.
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
and with some minor changes that bill
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
should have been passed and signed by
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
but because Casella didn't like that
 
00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
bill here we are representative Potenza
 
00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:12.539 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we have any kind of
 
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
proof or or um
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
any information
 
00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:21.059 align:start position:0%
regarding what Casella has said or not
 
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
said and I don't believe this bill has
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
really anything to do with Casella it
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
has or to or with Forest Lake or with
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
Dalton this has to do with establishing
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
citing rules for Des for citing
 
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
landfills and I would ex I would hope
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
that you would suspend any discussion
 
00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.409 align:start position:0%
that you would suspend any discussion
about

00:26:44.409 --> 00:26:44.419 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
lobbyists or Casella or anyone else
 
00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:51.419 align:start position:0%
please speak to the legislation okay the
 
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
Bixby Amendment
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
does nothing to improve the inherently
 
00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:57.419 align:start position:0%
flawed SB 61.
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
it is time to call what it is there are
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
very bad actors that are using political
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
and financially lobbying efforts which
 
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
influence and create bias by the
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
governor and the Senate and circumvent
 
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
the obvious and blatant will of the
 
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
people our constituents that only want
 
00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:16.700 align:start position:0%
clean water and not on toxic living
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
environments for themselves and their
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
families in addition many of these
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
constituents who have diligently and
 
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
respectfully contacted this committee
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
and been in attendance at committee
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
meetings whom have considerable and
 
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
diverse expertise on the subject will
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
not be ignored by me wasn't this what as
 
00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:36.539 align:start position:0%
I was elected to do it is time to be
 
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
brave and make doing the right thing
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
popular again
 
00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:44.520 align:start position:0%

00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
um ample is specifically going to help
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
in regards with that oh yes can you
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
please reference the line that you're
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
talking about yes
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
page in line
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
so it is
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
uh three
 
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
new paragraph under
 
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
is that page two page three page two I'm
 
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:24.549 align:start position:0%
is that page two page three page two I'm
sorry

00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
three under
 
00:29:27.419 --> 00:29:29.510 align:start position:0%
three under
3A

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
3A
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
line nine
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:42.419 align:start position:0%
the next is a same page under B which is
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
um it removes the word uh representative
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
under B the volume gradient
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
so it's basically now says to measure or
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
model travel time and its variability
 
00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:57.059 align:start position:0%
across the site
 
00:29:57.059 --> 00:30:17.330 align:start position:0%
across the site
foreign

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:21.539 align:start position:0%
the next is on page three lines line
 
00:30:21.539 --> 00:30:23.690 align:start position:0%
the next is on page three lines line
seven

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
um under under B is changed to if a
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
permit application proposes any measure
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
pursuant to 149 M9 xvea and the
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
department relies on those measures in
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
their formulation of the site-specific
 
00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:40.220 align:start position:0%
setback required by 149
 
00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:42.299 align:start position:0%
m73a the department shall require
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
implementation of those measures as
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
same page under
 
00:30:53.399 --> 00:30:56.990 align:start position:0%
same page under
five

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
pretty much what was added to this is
 
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
the draft request shall require each
 
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
proposal to provide a statement of any
 
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
potential conflicts of interest with any
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
entity that may benefit from any changes
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
in setback requirements indicating that
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
preference may be given to firms or
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
individuals without such conflicts of
 
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
interest or to firms or individuals with
 
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
the fewest conflicts of interest the
 
00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
draft request will also indicate that
 
00:31:27.049 --> 00:31:27.059 align:start position:0%
preference will be given to proposals
 
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
which demonstrate the qualified
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
consulting firms or individuals have
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
credentials and experience in evaluating
 
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
the health and safety risks associated
 
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
with the Environmental Protection as
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
well as the engineering and
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
hydrogeological aspects of landfill
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.889 --> 00:31:53.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
puts the legislature back in
 
00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:02.510 align:start position:0%
puts the legislature back in
um

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
in the place that it needs to be
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
line 10 item two the selected contractor
 
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
sells shall complete the assessment and
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
submit a final report to the department
 
00:32:18.409 --> 00:32:18.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
yes there it is okay I'm sorry
 
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.610 align:start position:0%
yes there it is okay I'm sorry
um

um
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
so it's page five line six the
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services show reports of
 
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
the house and
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
and the Senate energy and natural
 
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
resources committee by November 4th 14th
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
2024 relative to the pro progress of the
 
00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
rulemaker and under this act if the
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner believes that he or she
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
will not be able to complete the
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process within the 24-month
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
period allotted he issues shall report
 
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:03.059 align:start position:0%
to the Committees how much time he or
 
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
she deems necessary to complete the
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.419 --> 00:33:31.850 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
um sorry representative Haskins thank
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:38.149 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
obviously

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
um we did not have a lot of time to put
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
this new Amendment together I want to
 
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
thank my colleague who happens to be on
 
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
the other side of the aisle for all her
 
00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:51.059 align:start position:0%
hard work
 
00:33:51.059 --> 00:33:52.070 align:start position:0%
hard work
um

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
I I co-sponsor this amendment because
 
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
these are the changes that many of us
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
wanted in the bill and
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
we did not get them in the amendment
 
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
we sent the Senate a very good bill they
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
sent us back 61 which I don't believe is
 
00:34:16.609 --> 00:34:16.619 align:start position:0%
adequate protection for all the citizens
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
we can't be naive
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
there there is a reason why there's
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
pressure on this bill right now
 
00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
and as a lake person it matters very
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
much to me that we are very careful
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
about where we put our landfills and
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
since there is no current need for a
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
landfill in New Hampshire
 
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
for probably 20 years we do not have to
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
bow to the pressure that we have
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
received so that is why I am happy to
 
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor the Potenza Haskins Amendment
 
00:34:57.609 --> 00:34:57.619 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Haskins
 
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
representative verbal
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so
 
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'm a little nervous about the the
 
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
amendment in that it seems to be
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
particularly uh open-ended with respect
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
to the last point which originates on on
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
page five section four
 
00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:20.099 align:start position:0%
so the the commissioner is going to
 
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:23.579 align:start position:0%
report to the legislature the progress
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
of the rule making and if the
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner believes that they will not
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
be able to complete the rulemaking
 
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
process within two years
 
00:35:35.089 --> 00:35:35.099 align:start position:0%
that person uh the the commissioner
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
shall report to the Committees how much
 
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
more time deemed
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
necessary so if the commissioner shows
 
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
up and says boy I'm I'm close I would
 
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
say within another 10 to 12 years we're
 
00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
going to have this buttoned up there's
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no pushback in the in
 
00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:56.579 align:start position:0%
the amendment so in fact the the rule
 
00:35:59.089 --> 00:35:59.099 align:start position:0%
making processes this amendment is laid
 
00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
out potentially could be at infant item
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
for that reason I don't think I can
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
support this uh this amendment although
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the uh the intent in which
 
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
it was filed thank you madam chair thank
 
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:10.970 align:start position:0%
it was filed thank you madam chair thank
you

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:10.980 align:start position:0%

00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:14.339 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby oh I'm sorry
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby uh I
 
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
a phrase we use a lot when we're
 
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
considering legislation is we can't let
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
the uh the perfect be the enemy of the
 
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
good and and that is often overused but
 
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
it is something I genuinely believe I do
 
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
feel and that's where I have been
 
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
coming again and again and again as we
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
think about this bill we've gotten to a
 
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
point where I I don't think we're in the
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
area of the good anymore so I will be
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
supporting the amendment
 
00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:50.339 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby
 
00:36:52.609 --> 00:36:52.619 align:start position:0%

00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
I wish that uh I I wish that if this
 
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
amendment were attached to the bill that
 
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
the bill would have a hope of passing
 
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh but uh I was told Point Blank by a
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
member of the other body this morning
 
00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
that if the governor does not support
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
the bill that there would not be a
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
senate concurrence
 
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
and I don't like that game
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
I don't like the fact that we're passing
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
a bill that is much weaker than I think
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
it ought to be
 
00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.630 align:start position:0%
it ought to be
but

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
I go back to the idea of either having
 
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
that two years of Advance or having
 
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
permits starting next as soon as the uh
 
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:43.140 align:start position:0%
non-concurrence comes down and as a
 
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
result of that I can't support this
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'll be supporting the
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.390 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.210 align:start position:0%
um
I

00:37:59.210 --> 00:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
I've been into Bixby and and represented
 
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
representative jimana but I I am hanging
 
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
my hat on the abeyance part because I
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
think that if we if we were to leave any
 
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.849 align:start position:0%
think that if we if we were to leave any
opening

00:38:10.849 --> 00:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
opening
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
there is a very good chance that that
 
00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
actors or people who don't care as much
 
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
as we do about pollution and toxins
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins thank you madam
 
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.250 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins thank you madam
chair

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
with respect if we don't like the way
 
00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
the game is played let's not play the
 
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:33.170 align:start position:0%
the game is played let's not play the
game

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
game
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
and that's why I
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored the Potenza Haskins
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't think we should act in
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
good conscience under threat we are a
 
00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:47.220 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
we make the laws let's make a law we
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
believe in and if the other side doesn't
 
00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:56.180 align:start position:0%
accept it that's on them thank you
 
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative verbal
 
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I have to admit
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
that I I found the testimony of
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
Representative Bixby to be quite
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
compelling uh and for that reason I've
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
I've changed my position I will support
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
this amendment but I will not be
 
00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:11.220 align:start position:0%
supporting uh the the underlying Bill
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.329 --> 00:39:19.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:24.140 align:start position:0%
okay representative Dotsy
 
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
um I agree I mean first of all we have
 
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
three branches of government and we have
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
them for a reason for checks and
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
balances and yes as a legislative body
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
we certainly have the right to put
 
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
forward any legislation that we deem is
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the people of
 
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I would have hoped that
 
00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:49.619 align:start position:0%
would have been two previous bills that
 
00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
came before this committee that were
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
vetted uh that were excellent bills they
 
00:39:57.970 --> 00:39:57.980 align:start position:0%
should have passed they should have
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
overridden The veto but the other body
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
chose not to do that
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
however we have to recognize the
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
political realities we do have a
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
government where the executive branch
 
00:40:13.329 --> 00:40:13.339 align:start position:0%
can exercise its veto power
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
we all agree with that even though
 
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
sometimes we don't like it so for that
 
00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
reason recognizing the political Powers
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
I will be voting against this amendment
 
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
even though I do see what it's trying to
 
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
do and I will vote for the bill with the
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate Amendment hopefully because
 
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
that's the political reality that we
 
00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:41.099 align:start position:0%
live under and I agree that the two the
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
24-month moratorium is the best deal
 
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
that we can make right now
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
any other comment represents suffolkitis
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
just want to thank everybody for their
 
00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.010 align:start position:0%
just want to thank everybody for their
um

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
their steadfastness in thinking about
 
00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
this and for putting in amendments I'm
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
I'm very pleased because
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
um that's what we're here for to take
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
any other comment representative coulon
 
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair oh yeah I'd just
 
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
like to say that um
 
00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
I'll be supporting this amendment and I
 
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
just want to add a little bit of um
 
00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:26.579 align:start position:0%
you know texture to it I've been put
 
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
under a lot of pressure myself and
 
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
received a lot of emails from different
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
people regarding this subject and I
 
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
think it is possible that some of that
 
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
um you know concern could be transferred
 
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
to the Executive Branch if we were to
 
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
pass an amendment like this
 
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
so that's my
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's what I got and uh thank you
 
00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.250 align:start position:0%
that's what I got and uh thank you
everyone

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
seeing none no I'm sorry representative
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
when this committee was hearing the
 
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.310 align:start position:0%
when this committee was hearing the
testimony

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.690 align:start position:0%
testimony
um

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
there was in a sense like a you know
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
from the table there was a threat like
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
okay well you can't make any changes to
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
this or you know
 
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's it's not going to go through the
 
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
governor is going to veto it and that is
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
not how things work as other
 
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
Representatives have said with their
 
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
bodies and stuff like that and
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
I just have to say that
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
putting some things in
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
like let's remind everybody here
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
that 56 was passed
 
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:44.339 align:start position:0%
you know overwhelmingly
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
and we're making in a sense uh a
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
concession a couple concessions in here
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
to a study that's we've made 56 a study
 
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
now and that's that's a gigantic
 
00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.430 align:start position:0%
now and that's that's a gigantic
concession

00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
concession
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
so if we're trying to make this study a
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
little bit stronger
 
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
with more safeguards and guard rails
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
isn't that something that the governor
 
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:11.099 align:start position:0%
shouldn't object
 
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:13.140 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing we have to do the
 
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
right thing and I don't think we need to
 
00:43:17.809 --> 00:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
think about what this other body or what
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
this other entity is doing we need to do
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
what's right for our constituents that's
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
why this is important to go through
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
representative Contour thank you madam
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
chair I just want clarification on
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
something that was stated earlier
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
so if uh I'm just going to ask a general
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
question okay
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
they can have an extension as cited
 
00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
for up to 10 years
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
if they do not meet the deadline does
 
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
that mean that landfill citing can begin
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
after the two-year period with the
 
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative germana uh thank you and
 
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
this is a question that is in tandem
 
00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:18.790 align:start position:0%
this is a question that is in tandem
with

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:20.339 align:start position:0%
representative's question because I
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
think that is a it's a good point I if
 
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken and represented bixby's
 
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh which we have adopted it it
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
references in in terms of an extension
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
it references an already existing RSA
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
correct so I agree that the language as
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
it is existed in 1988 is open-ended
 
00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
that's a that's really good point but I
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
believe that there are in fact rules
 
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
already in place regarding an extension
 
00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:50.099 align:start position:0%
that I assume would be valid in this
 
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
case as well because as I said the Bixby
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment refers specifically to set of
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
rules so that's there's a question in
 
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
um is there already a mechanism for such
 
00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
an extension that would not in fact
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
leave it completely wide open
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
Madam chair this is a question for the
 
00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
chair actually
 
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
um if I may sure
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
um if this amendment were to be adopted
 
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
it would then supersede the previous
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
amendment is that not correct I am right
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
now checking with the clerk so I'll let
 
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:44.780 align:start position:0%
15 more compatible and can be eventually
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
I will know in a moment representative
 
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
Contour thank you
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair uh and this is a question
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
for the sponsor of this legislation I
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
don't believe my question has been
 
00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.710 align:start position:0%
don't believe my question has been
answered

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
answered
 
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
did you restate your question
 
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair the question was
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
if you can extend the rulemaking process
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
for an infinite time period
 
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
are you still are you then able to
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
postpone the sighting of landfills for
 
00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:26.579 align:start position:0%
an infinite time period based on the
 
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
represent Potenza would you please reply
 
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
so I believe that this is not infinite
 
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
it is just if the they can't meet the 24
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
months requirement then it does go back
 
00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
to effect of what the current
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
um statute is in place it's just of
 
00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
course How It Was Written and I took
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
that same language from representative
 
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.329 align:start position:0%
that same language from representative
Bixby

00:46:56.329 --> 00:46:56.339 align:start position:0%
Bixby
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
in regards with a 90-day extension
 
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
um Des can't give itself the authority
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
to do that so that's why this if the
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
department does not adopt the rules in
 
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
accordance with
 
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
um that they can basically they're
 
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:11.339 align:start position:0%
asking for it but it doesn't leave it
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
open-ended it goes back to the previous
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
year in regards what it has to be done
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
in 24 months
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
um and I just received information from
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
our clerk Paul Paul Smith
 
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
saying that and the question was what
 
00:47:34.849 --> 00:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
happens if two amendments on a bill
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
passed that may not work together
 
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
in the committee and he said you have to
 
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
merge amendments to only have one
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment from the committee if they
 
00:47:46.609 --> 00:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
don't work together it's going to be an
 
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
issue so
 
00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:51.079 align:start position:0%
um seeing that
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
passing both of these amendments would
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
be problematic
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
and I'll just leave it at that and
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
so I was just reading on page five uh
 
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
um starting at line six uh section Roman
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
four uh and I do not see in this section
 
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
anything that continues the abeyance
 
00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:20.579 align:start position:0%
which means that as this amendment is
 
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
currently written the abeyance will
 
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:26.900 align:start position:0%
still disappear at 24 months and then
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
uh citing can begin under old rules if
 
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
the new rules are not yet written and I
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.710 align:start position:0%
think that
um

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
I don't think that was the intent of
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
this amendment I think the this that the
 
00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
the intent was probably to have a
 
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
continuance of continuation of that
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
advance but it is not written that way
 
00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh right now and I think that uh if the
 
00:48:56.089 --> 00:48:56.099 align:start position:0%
author if the supporters of this
 
00:48:58.609 --> 00:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
amendment want it to come forward in a
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
way that is sufficiently strong it
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
should probably be offered as a floor
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment on not offered right now as a
 
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
as as part of the committee
 
00:49:11.089 --> 00:49:11.099 align:start position:0%
I would concur with that representative
 
00:49:11.099 --> 00:49:13.309 align:start position:0%
I would concur with that representative
Bixby

00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
Bixby
 
00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on this amendment
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative verval
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and while I don't
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
disagree with the with the previous
 
00:49:22.079 --> 00:49:24.050 align:start position:0%
disagree with the with the previous
discussion

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.430 align:start position:0%
discussion
um

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
the the odds of a floor Amendment
 
00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
is certainly um
 
00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:34.619 align:start position:0%
unclear especially without some
 
00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
indication of a committee recommendation
 
00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.569 align:start position:0%
indication of a committee recommendation
so

00:49:38.569 --> 00:49:38.579 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't know that uh
 
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
that I would allow the concept of adding
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
this later as a floor Amendment as a
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
possibility to sway one's vote I'm not
 
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
Advocate right now I'm not advocating
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
for or against I just I don't I don't
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
think that it's necessarily a good
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
strategy for the sponsor and the
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor to withdraw an amendment and
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
hope they can get it passed on on the
 
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
floor of the house especially late in
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
the session where things start to get
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
rushed and people want to go home so I
 
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to to vote your
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
conscience on the amendment and see
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
where it falls thank you madam chair
 
00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
we did you have a question I think
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
representative oh representative Haskins
 
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you madam chair
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
it's obvious that we didn't have a lot
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
of time to put this together and I and I
 
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
suppose the amendment reveals that I I
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
don't have a lack of confidence in d e s
 
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
to get this rulemaking done there's no
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
way that they would drag it out year
 
00:50:44.569 --> 00:50:44.579 align:start position:0%
after year that just doesn't behoove
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
anyone's interest I wish the wording
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
could be amended
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
that would preclude that drawing out for
 
00:50:59.329 --> 00:50:59.339 align:start position:0%
Infinity but again these we're talking
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
about professionals I I just don't see
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
that as a realistic option that it would
 
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.170 align:start position:0%
that as a realistic option that it would
happen

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we can on the Fly add
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
that abeyance is important to all of us
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
every one of us
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
so if our Amendment could be amended to
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
put abeyance in that section
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
I would love to do that
 
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
I believe it's a little late because we
 
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
would we are voting on this amendment
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
representative germano thank you madam
 
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
chair I had an idea and I thought better
 
00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
of it and I thought better of thinking
 
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
better of it uh so so thank you
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
um I one of the issues that I've
 
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
repeatedly raised is a concern about the
 
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
extension of the abeyance and whether it
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
could be made a shall uh Clause as
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to a May clause and how that
 
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
might work and I talked to OLS about
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
that so that has been a concern of mine
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
from our discussions however I I've
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
become increasingly
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
to think that I'm not also not concerned
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
that this is not going to be completed
 
00:52:09.049 --> 00:52:09.059 align:start position:0%
in the 24-month period in part because I
 
00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
think one of the things that that was
 
00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
made clear throughout all of her
 
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:14.220 align:start position:0%
testimony is we're not talking about new
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
science here right we actually already
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
have the science uh that we need in
 
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
order to to to make the current rules we
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
could do a survey of states around us
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
and look at a variety of options Des
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
could present those to this committee
 
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
into the legislature and then the
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
legislature could could drive that
 
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
process so I don't actually think that
 
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
there's any danger that this is not
 
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:41.220 align:start position:0%
going to be completed in a 24-month
 
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
period so uh while I I think the point
 
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
is is a really good one I think it is
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
left vague and would prefer it not to be
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
I don't see a danger in it extending
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
beyond the 24 month period thank you
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
um any other comments or questions on
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
this particular Amendment
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
so I will reiterate what uh what I've
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
heard here from the um house Clerk
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
that um we would have to merge these
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
amendments to have only one Amendment
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
if they don't work together it's going
 
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
to be an issue so seeing as we've passed
 
00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
the previous Bixby Amendment
 
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:28.609 align:start position:0%
the previous Bixby Amendment
um

00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
passing this amendment to will cause
 
00:53:35.089 --> 00:53:35.099 align:start position:0%
many problems I don't know how that
 
00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:36.980 align:start position:0%
would be rectified
 
00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
because there is different language in
 
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
both of these amendments
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
and for that reason I can't support this
 
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.309 align:start position:0%
and for that reason I can't support this
amendment

00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
if there are any other questions or
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
comments about this
 
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.250 align:start position:0%
comments about this
um

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
I would say that the clerk should call
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
the roll
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%

represent Bixby would you like to speak
 
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
to your motion uh I think we've covered
 
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
the ground fairly thoroughly so I think
 
00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:42.980 align:start position:0%
we should just move to the vote okay
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.089 --> 00:55:53.099 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I want to say
 
00:55:55.609 --> 00:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
first of all that I appreciate all the
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
the hard work and I respect the
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
Integrity of uh of my committee
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
colleagues who work so hard to make this
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
bill something we can live with I want
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
the public who are here or the public
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
who are watching uh streaming online I
 
00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:56:14.089 --> 00:56:14.099 align:start position:0%
I want to let them know that everybody
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
on this committee is
 
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
working with the best interests I
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
genuinely believe everyone on this
 
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
committee is working with the best
 
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
interests of the people of the State of
 
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in mind this is uh a
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
sausage making process and uh and and it
 
00:56:31.609 --> 00:56:31.619 align:start position:0%
can be really difficult at times but but
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
I have enjoyed working with all of you
 
00:56:35.569 --> 00:56:35.579 align:start position:0%
and as I said I don't doubt for a moment
 
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
your commitment anyone on this committee
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
to uh to the people of this state
 
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:43.220 align:start position:0%
the the more I told myself
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
that some bill was better than no bill
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
the more ultimately I came to realize
 
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
that I was just trying to justify voting
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
for a bill that in the end I can't
 
00:56:56.770 --> 00:56:56.780 align:start position:0%
support when we look at a couple of of
 
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
examples of language that we couldn't
 
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099 align:start position:0%
get into the bill
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
to me this is just stunning we couldn't
 
00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
get ample margin of safety into the bill
 
00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
because of political pressure and
 
00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
pressure from a lobbyist we couldn't get
 
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
variability across a site if we can't
 
00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:19.140 align:start position:0%
have testing that gives us variability
 
00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
across the site
 
00:57:23.329 --> 00:57:23.339 align:start position:0%
you could test within I don't know a 50
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
square foot section you could put 10 10
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
test drills in a 50 square foot section
 
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
that's not a site-specific test that's a
 
00:57:35.089 --> 00:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
50 square foot specific test that gives
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the end as I said I do genuinely
 
00:57:44.089 --> 00:57:44.099 align:start position:0%
believe that we can't let the enemy or
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
the perfect be the enemy of the good
 
00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:48.660 align:start position:0%
this bill crossed a line at a certain
 
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
point where I no longer felt we were
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
actually doing the good so again I want
 
00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
to appreciate
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
the work of all of my colleagues and
 
00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
express my admiration for all of the
 
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
work that this committee has done and
 
00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
how well Madam chair you have conducted
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
these these hearings but in the end I
 
00:58:08.089 --> 00:58:08.099 align:start position:0%
cannot vote for the bill thank you
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
um while I agree 100 with representative
 
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
germanna except for voting against this
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
bill we are buying ourselves time with
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
this we and I believe that it's
 
00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:22.740 align:start position:0%
important time I think it's a it's a
 
00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:26.700 align:start position:0%
good um a good uh purchase of of time
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that people would
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
support it so that we can do something
 
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
better in the next two years
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins I too have used
 
00:58:38.329 --> 00:58:38.339 align:start position:0%
the metaphor about the perfect and the
 
00:58:38.339 --> 00:58:39.109 align:start position:0%
the metaphor about the perfect and the
good

00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it is good as it
 
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
stands which is why I can't vote for it
 
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
and I also don't think that the
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
Amendments necessarily conflict
 
00:58:50.569 --> 00:58:50.579 align:start position:0%
uh you know I don't know enough about
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
the process but I I don't think that
 
00:58:58.609 --> 00:58:58.619 align:start position:0%
they are conflicting amendments so that
 
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
um comment from the clerk
 
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:04.740 align:start position:0%
um does an outline expressly what can be
 
00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
done about that
 
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:07.880 align:start position:0%

two of the three previous speakers
 
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
um for not the reasons they outlined uh
 
00:59:23.089 --> 00:59:23.099 align:start position:0%
but I I agree that that this bill
 
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
um even as amended is is not a good bill
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
it is it is not the solution that any of
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
us are looking for it has flaws on on
 
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
both both sides of the perspective
 
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
um and for that reason I too am not
 
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:42.780 align:start position:0%

but in the end I think uh us putting
 
01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.230 align:start position:0%

something

01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
that we can bring back to the Senate
 
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
will be something that will be workable
 
01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.210 align:start position:0%
will be something that will be workable
and

01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:44.750 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
I would also like to uh
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
extend my apologies
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
to Mr demiers
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
publicly because I believe it's
 
01:01:59.530 --> 01:01:59.540 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to attack anybody
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
personally from this body
 
01:02:05.569 --> 01:02:05.579 align:start position:0%
and there were some words that were said
 
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
earlier which I was disappointed to hear
 
01:02:13.849 --> 01:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
so please accept at least my apology for
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
um for those words
 
01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:18.049 align:start position:0%
um for those words
and

01:02:18.049 --> 01:02:18.059 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so I'd also like to
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank the committee for working
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
diligently on this bill I
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.690 align:start position:0%
have been
um

01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:31.859 align:start position:0%
frustrated that we have not been able to
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
get the bill we would have liked to pass
 
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
both bodies I think that HB 56 was a
 
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
much better Bill than what we have just
 
01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.690 align:start position:0%
much better Bill than what we have just
passed

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:40.700 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
but uh I think that it is really
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
important to have the time without
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
having to worry about a permit going in
 
01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:55.140 align:start position:0%
with the next two years to get better
 
01:02:58.849 --> 01:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
rules than what we have now and I also
 
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh the disc when we discussed
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh this a couple weeks ago we talked
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
about the possibility of having a
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee from this committee that
 
01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
would be working on oversight of the
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
entire process and I hope that we carry
 
01:03:18.609 --> 01:03:18.619 align:start position:0%
through on that and I hope that we get
 
01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
members from both sides of this vote uh
 
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
as well as both sides of this aisle to
 
01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
uh of the aisle to participate in that
 
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
so I think we will set up a subcommittee
 
01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
depending on what happens with this bill
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
um also I imagine uh representative
 
01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
Bixby that you will be writing the
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
majority report for this
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
I will be writing the majority report
 
01:03:56.569 --> 01:03:56.579 align:start position:0%
um I think that those who are in
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill should decide who
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
they want as to write The Minority
 
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:03.260 align:start position:0%
Report because I think it might come out
 
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
uh I I think that the votes against were
 
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
not always all for the same reason so I
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
think that those who are in the minority
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
should uh decide among themselves who
 
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:16.740 align:start position:0%
should write that Minority Report okay
 
01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
representative verbal thank you madam
 
01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
chair yeah I noticed the Minority Report
 
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
coming down I have no problem yielding
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
to others if they prefer to write that
 
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
Minority Report that is obviously going
 
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:30.299 align:start position:0%
to be a floor fight on this bill and I'd
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
be more than artistic more than happy to
 
01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
articulate my opposition uh during the
 
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
floor debate if if somebody else prefers
 
01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:39.059 align:start position:0%
to write The Minority Report
 
01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
as co-sponsor of the bill I'd be happy
 
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
to write the report okay
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you this
 
01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
is a question for you madam chair is
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
there a majority and a minority report
 
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
for each potential Amendment or because
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay Bill as a whole okay thank you
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
and so I would like to have that
 
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
Minority Report this afternoon if
 
01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.250 align:start position:0%
Minority Report this afternoon if
possible

01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
or this evening you can email it to me
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
same with you representative Bixby
 
01:05:15.069 --> 01:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan well I'm I'm
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
just a substitute so I missed a lot at
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
the beginning but it I sounded like
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
what represented Potenza and Haskins
 
01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:26.099 align:start position:0%
what they had in mind was sort of a
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
superset of what representative Bixby
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
gave us so they
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
approved of everything that was in the
 
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
Bixby Amendment but they may have worded
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
some of it differently I guess and then
 
01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
they had more before is that is that my
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
correct understanding of what happened
 
01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:42.299 align:start position:0%
to her it was slightly different yes
 
01:05:42.299 --> 01:05:44.450 align:start position:0%
to her it was slightly different yes
okay

01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%

01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.569 --> 01:06:59.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.329 --> 01:07:02.339 align:start position:0%
our pleasure thank you yes volunteers
 
01:07:02.339 --> 01:07:09.170 align:start position:0%
our pleasure thank you yes volunteers
substitute

01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.109 --> 01:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
it would be interesting writing the
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
group of people who voted on both sides
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
of that issue it's just a weird
 
01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
illumination you'll never see those
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
are we breaking for five minutes
 
01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:18.980 align:start position:0%
and as soon as they get set up here yeah
 
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
so so when everybody's back in we'll
 
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
we'll get started I'm sorry to keep you
 
01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
oh yeah no worries we'll give it a few
 
01:08:28.929 --> 01:08:28.939 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:31.010 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
so everything for verbal
 
01:08:37.689 --> 01:08:37.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
and I think we can give that to Gene I
 
01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:46.090 align:start position:0%
and I think we can give that to Gene I
mean

01:08:46.090 --> 01:08:46.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
one second while representative Davis
 
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
comes back from delivering that paper
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.309 align:start position:0%
okay
welcome

01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for the
 
01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
committee for uh inviting us here to
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
give an update on soil pfas in New
 
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and an update on biosolids my
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
name is Jeff Martz I'm the administrator
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
of the Hazardous Waste remediation
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
Bureau at DES I'm also a hydrogeologist
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
and our Bureau is tasked with developing
 
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
soil remediation standards for pfas and
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give the update on soil and
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
then Anthony Drew in here we'll talk
 
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
so I want to cover four topics in a
 
01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
relatively short period of time give you
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
a high level overview the first is the
 
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
USGS soil study task number one which
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
was to evaluate soil pfas and in Shallow
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
soil across the state then I'm going to
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
give an example of pfas and soil at a
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
contaminated site
 
01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
next they're going to talk about the
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
USGS task 2 laboratory leaching
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
experiments I'm only going to briefly
 
01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
touch on that and then I'm going to get
 
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
into the New Hampshire Des pfas oil
 
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
remediation standard development give
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
you a brief update on where we are
 
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
so back in 2019 uh when new lower
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
stringent standards were adopted for
 
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
pfas in groundwater became apparent that
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to adopt eventually
 
01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
standards that were protective of
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
groundwater but there was a lot of
 
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
emerging science on the complexity of
 
01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
how pfas behave in the in the
 
01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
environment and we thought it was
 
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
important to identify one what type of
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
pfas are present in New Hampshire soils
 
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
and to identify some of the factors
 
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
specific to New Hampshire soils that
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
affect leachability of these compounds
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
so Des partnered with U.S Geological
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
Survey to do a three-part study that
 
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
included one the characterization of
 
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
shallow soil pfas which I'll talk about
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
on some more slides task two was to
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
assess the partitioning or or the
 
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
passage of pfas from soil to liquid in
 
01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
the environment and what are the
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
important factors that influence that in
 
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
our state soils I'm not going to go into
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
this in a lot of detail it's a very
 
01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
complex topic but I'm going to talk
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
about how that's going to inform our
 
01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
soil remediation standard development
 
01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
finally the task 3 evaluated pfas
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
transport at two sites one where there
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
was an a triple F release site and the
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
other was a biosolid site and
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have time to get
 
01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:31.940 align:start position:0%
into that the results of that study
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
so here's a slide that was put together
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
by Andrea takranov the lead investigator
 
01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
from the USGS as well as her team
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
including Leah santangelo and Sydney
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
Welch as well as some Des staff Kate I'm
 
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
a slow Sher myself and Anthony drouin
 
01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to show several slides
 
01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
that were put together by USGS and they
 
01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
had the USGS logo in the bottom
 
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
so the the steady design for the soil
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
sampling across the state the purpose of
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
that was to characterize pfas and
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
shallow soil in areas throughout New
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are not known to be
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
impacted by a contaminated or a local
 
01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
pfas source so to do this the USGS
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
gritted the state into a hundred equal
 
01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
area cells and then classified lands as
 
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
either a forested shrubland or
 
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
herbaceous to kind of filter out Urban
 
01:12:23.689 --> 01:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
lands and then they placed a 500 meter
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
buffer around Parcels where we had
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
potential pfas contamination or releases
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
and next they use GIS to randomly
 
01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
generate sites for sampling in each one
 
01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
of those hundred sites was sampled the
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
soil was sampled from zero to six inches
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
and then at 50 of those sites they
 
01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
collected a sample from 6 to 12 inches
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
and at a smaller subset they collected
 
01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
some deeper soil samples to characterize
 
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
pfas across the state
 
01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to jump right into some of
 
01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:54.179 align:start position:0%
the results uh from this study and on
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
the left hand side showing the
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
concentration that was detected in the
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
shallow soil samples for pfoa one of the
 
01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
compounds that we regulate in
 
01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
groundwater and the units presented are
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
in nanograms per gram which is
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
equivalent to a part per billion in soil
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
and it supported to differentiate that
 
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
from parts per trillion that we regulate
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
in groundwater so different orders of
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
magnitude but the scale goes from uh
 
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
below detection at 0.5 to greater than
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
three parts per billion for pfoa and one
 
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
of the takeaways when you look at this
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
graph is that the colors get warmer
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
meaning there's generally a increase in
 
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
concentration As you move from the
 
01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:31.140 align:start position:0%
northern part of the state to the
 
01:13:33.169 --> 01:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state
 
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
next moving to the middle plot is the
 
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
concentration of pfos and what we see is
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
a more random distribution of some of
 
01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
the higher concentrations compared to
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
the lower concentrations and we're
 
01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
currently investigating why that might
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
be but it could be a function of how
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
pfos behaves tends to be a little
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
stickier to soil compared to pfoa
 
01:13:56.209 --> 01:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
and finally the the plot on the right is
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
a measure called the top assay which is
 
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
used to measure the presence of
 
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
precursors so I think you probably heard
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
that there are thousands of pfas
 
01:14:08.689 --> 01:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
chemicals but we only regulate four so
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
this top assay was to get at whether
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
there are precursors in the soil and the
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
good news the takeaway is that there
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
seem to be very little precursors
 
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
present in New Hampshire soils
 
01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:19.930 align:start position:0%
present in New Hampshire soils
foreign

01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:19.940 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
plot showing the concentrations detected
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
for each of the pfas compounds so the
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
pfas compounds are listed across the
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
bottom it's a bar and whisker plot with
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
concentration of pfas and soil
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
increasing towards the top of the plot
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
and what I'd like you to take away is
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
that this blinking blue line is at the
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
concentration of one part per billion
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
and that one part per billion is the
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
common laboratory detection limit for
 
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
most commercial Laboratories so one of
 
01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
the key takeaways from the study is that
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
most of the soil samples for most of the
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
compounds were below that detection
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
limit by most common Laboratories so
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have been detected if we
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
sent them to any laboratory so the USGS
 
01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:05.219 align:start position:0%
worked with the laboratory that Des was
 
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
using to develop a lower detection limit
 
01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
to an in order to characterize these
 
01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.090 align:start position:0%
to an in order to characterize these
soils

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
soils
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
also want to call your attention to the
 
01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:15.659 align:start position:0%
black bold line in the center of the
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
boxes that value represents the median
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
or an average of the samples for each
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
compound and if you look at pfoa which
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
is towards the left hand side of the
 
01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
plot you can see that the median for
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
pfoa is just below that one part per
 
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
billion minimum detection level for
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
common Laboratories and similarly pfos
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
which is on the right hand side that
 
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
median value is very close to that one
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
part per billion level
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
so next I'm going to talk briefly about
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
an example of a contaminated site Saint
 
01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
Cobain in Southern New Hampshire where
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
they had air emissions the image on the
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
right is a depiction and a color
 
01:15:59.209 --> 01:15:59.219 align:start position:0%
representation of the modeled air
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
deposition of the compound pfoa with the
 
01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
warmer colors the yellows representing a
 
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
higher concentration of pfoa that was
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
deposited on the ground and the cooler
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
colors representing lower concentrations
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
but not insignificant with respect to
 
01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
groundwater and what we see when we zoom
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
in on the site the image on the left is
 
01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
an excerpt from one of the site
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
investigation reports showing pfoa in
 
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
soil and what you can see from the
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
orange colored samples is that some of
 
01:16:31.729 --> 01:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
the samples on this figure exceeded 200
 
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
parts per billion which is our direct
 
01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
contact value for soil so we had very
 
01:16:39.169 --> 01:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
high concentration so most of the data
 
01:16:42.649 --> 01:16:42.659 align:start position:0%
from the USGS sampling effort was below
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
apart per billion and adjacent to single
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
main we had in the excess of 200 parts
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
per billion just to give you a sense of
 
01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
the range and if you look at a triple F
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
release sites we also see hundreds of
 
01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
parts per billion where a triple F was
 
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
applied to the ground
 
01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:57.130 align:start position:0%
applied to the ground
foreign

01:16:57.130 --> 01:16:57.140 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
this to the to the groundwater it's very
 
01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
complex and a kind of like a an onion uh
 
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
that there are many layers that
 
01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
influence ultimately the concentrations
 
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:08.940 align:start position:0%
that we see in groundwater so the amount
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
of air deposition that occurs the
 
01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
surfacial geology coupled with the
 
01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
Bedrock geology as well as time related
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
factors such as changes in the chemicals
 
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
released over time seasonal variations
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
all influence what we see when we sample
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
groundwater and the image on the lower
 
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
right represents pfoa measured in water
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
supply Wells inside the cincobain
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
consent decree area and we see a very
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
complex pattern where the green dots
 
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
represent less than half of our ambient
 
01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality standard of 12 so
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's zero to six parts per trillion
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
and they can be immediately adjacent to
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
water supply Wells that exceed our
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
standard of 12 parts per trillion so we
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
see this very complex pattern and I
 
01:17:51.649 --> 01:17:51.659 align:start position:0%
attribute to that to the many
 
01:17:53.689 --> 01:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
complexities of how these compounds move
 
01:17:56.050 --> 01:17:56.060 align:start position:0%
through the environment
 
01:17:58.250 --> 01:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
Switching gears now I'm going to talk a
 
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
little bit about SRS the soil
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
remediation standard development so we
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
have a director from the legislature to
 
01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
initiate rulemaking for the four
 
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
compounds that we regulate in
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
groundwater that rule making must be
 
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
initiated by November 1st now we do have
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
the direct contact risk-based values
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
which I said some of the soil sink
 
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
domain exceeds 200 for pfoa so our S1
 
01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
direct contact risk-based values to be
 
01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
protective of a child playing in the
 
01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
soil and maybe incidental ingestion and
 
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
it's 200 for pfoa and 100 for the other
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
three compounds that we regulate
 
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
this is a chart we'll provide some PDF
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
so you can look at this later but this
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
is a chart put together by the itrc
 
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
summarizing national values and as you
 
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
can just a brief takeaway is that
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
they're substantially lower than our
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
direct contact values
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
there are five factors that we consider
 
01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:52.739 align:start position:0%
when we're developing a soil remediation
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
standard include those direct contact
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
risk-based soil concentrations that I
 
01:18:59.209 --> 01:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
mentioned and then they involve leaching
 
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
based soil concentration so this is
 
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
where that task 2 from the USGS study
 
01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
comes into play where they looked at
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
various factors that influence
 
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
leachability such as pH total organic
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
carbon content and even things such as
 
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
protein so we Factor all this in as we
 
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
evaluate leachability of these compounds
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
third we have to take into account
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
background concentrations so that's
 
01:19:24.649 --> 01:19:24.659 align:start position:0%
where task one of the USGS study where
 
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
the 100 samples come into play to uh
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
help inform our understanding of
 
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
background and what concentrations are
 
01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
occurring in soils across the state
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh fourth we're going to take into
 
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
account ceiling concentrations and these
 
01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
generally tend to apply to other
 
01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
compounds that have odor thresholds so I
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
don't expect that to play a big role but
 
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
it's something we're considering and
 
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
finally a practical quantification
 
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
limits so this this speaks to the
 
01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
laboratory's ability to detect these
 
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
compounds and like I mentioned earlier
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
on that bar and whisker plot
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
conventional Laboratories at the time we
 
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
did this study were detecting down to
 
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:03.719 align:start position:0%
about one part per billion but there are
 
01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
some new EPA methods coming along that
 
01:20:08.689 --> 01:20:08.699 align:start position:0%
are expected to have a lower practical
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
quantification limit so we'll be able to
 
01:20:11.930 --> 01:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
measure these compounds at lower
 
01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.270 align:start position:0%
measure these compounds at lower
concentrations

01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
concentrations
 
01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
so lastly I just want to close uh by
 
01:20:20.209 --> 01:20:20.219 align:start position:0%
tying this into groundwater the map on
 
01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
the right shows Wells that contain less
 
01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
than half of our standard of 12 parts
 
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
per trillion for pfoa so the green shows
 
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
zero to six parts per trillion in
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
groundwater samples so even though we
 
01:20:35.209 --> 01:20:35.219 align:start position:0%
are seeing a widespread occurrence of
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
pfasts and soils across the state that
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily equate to widespread
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
exceedance of our current standards for
 
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
pfoa and our other other compounds so
 
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
with that I can either turn it over to
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
Anthony or take take questions
 
01:20:54.169 --> 01:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
01:20:54.179 --> 01:20:55.310 align:start position:0%
I have a question
how

01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:20:58.010 --> 01:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
how does New Hampshire compare to other
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
states with regard to the concentrations
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
that you're measuring
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh that that's a great question if we
 
01:21:06.890 --> 01:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
had more time I could show a slide
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
comparing us to Vermont Vermont did a
 
01:21:12.649 --> 01:21:12.659 align:start position:0%
study back in like 2018 and our our
 
01:21:15.649 --> 01:21:15.659 align:start position:0%
value our for pfoa was probably a little
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
higher on average than than Vermont but
 
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
generally they track somewhat similarly
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative Murray ah thank you madam
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for taking my
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
question one of the things that I do
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
want to ask is uh we're well aware that
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has the 12 parts per
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
trillion standard uh that was enacted
 
01:21:35.209 --> 01:21:35.219 align:start position:0%
into law but as far as
 
01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
um the current U.S EPA is looking at
 
01:21:38.689 --> 01:21:38.699 align:start position:0%
National drinking water standards that
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
may expand into looking at uh six pfas
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
sort of chains
 
01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
um and I was curious to know
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
are you seeing any parity I understand
 
01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
the chemicals react differently in soils
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
than they do water but are you seeing
 
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
any effort or desire from your
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
department to
 
01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:58.729 align:start position:0%
department to
um

01:21:58.729 --> 01:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
perhaps follow what's happening with the
 
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
national drinking water standards
 
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
obviously and then adjust soil and or
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
water based on what comes out of that
 
01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
um great great question so so by law if
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
those Federal mcls are adopted so those
 
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
are drinking water standards they would
 
01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
be adopted most likely as a drinking
 
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
water standards in the state and then by
 
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
law our ambient groundwater quality
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
standard would become equivalent to
 
01:22:26.689 --> 01:22:26.699 align:start position:0%
those those Federal MCL so the new
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
ambient groundwater quality standard
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
would become four if they were adopted
 
01:22:35.209 --> 01:22:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
any other questions no thank you very
 
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
and will we be able to get
 
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
um emailed a copy of the slides yeah
 
01:22:50.689 --> 01:22:50.699 align:start position:0%
we'll email uh PDFs of the thank you
 
01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
slides I know there's a lot a lot in
 
01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
also good morning everyone and I want to
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank Madam chair uh for inviting me
 
01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
today to speak to you guys my name is
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
Anthony drone I'm the supervisor of the
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
residuals management section at New
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Das we are the section within
 
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
the Wastewater engineering Bureau that
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
does regulate biosol land application uh
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
the hauling of sludge the management of
 
01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
biosols or sludge post wastewater
 
01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
treatment facility and also the
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
management of septic in the state
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
so today what I'm going to do is talk a
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
little bit about biosolid regulations to
 
01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
Clean Water Act why we're here what is
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
sludge management how did it become what
 
01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
it is today uh just a little bit of what
 
01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
our education Outreach efforts have been
 
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh since 2018 2019 when pfas really hit
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
the news for Wastewater uh going to talk
 
01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
about how is sludge septage and leachate
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
managed in the state going to give you
 
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
some numbers some annual numbers to look
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
at to think about how much volume do we
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
create and then the investigation that
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
we've been doing since 2017 uh just as a
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
note I joined DES in August of 2018 I
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
immediately took over the pfas
 
01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
investigation and all the work related
 
01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
to pfas and biosolids and then that
 
01:24:12.649 --> 01:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
investigation ramped up to Beyond
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
biosolids and we looked into collection
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
systems which you'll see that data today
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
and then lastly I wanted to talk about
 
01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
the future of sludge management New
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the technologies that we are
 
01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
looking at for destruction of sludge and
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
maybe some assistance we could have and
 
01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
looking further into those Technologies
 
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
so first I always do a quick Shameless
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
plug of who we are right now we are down
 
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
one person uh it's pretty common at DES
 
01:24:38.209 --> 01:24:38.219 align:start position:0%
at this time unfortunately but as you
 
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
can see I'm the supervisor I have
 
01:24:40.729 --> 01:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
oversight of the sludge quality
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
certification program which I'll go over
 
01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
that is the permit to distribute
 
01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
biosolids in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:24:48.110 --> 01:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
we do have a permitting enforcement
 
01:24:49.729 --> 01:24:49.739 align:start position:0%
engineer she just left our section
 
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
recently to go to a different section at
 
01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
DES so we are looking for a new engineer
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
for that position unfortunately we don't
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
have any applicants yet but that'll
 
01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
hopefully change soon Wade Pelham is our
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
sludge and septage coordinator he does
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
all our education Outreach he runs our
 
01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
Wastewater man Water and Wastewater
 
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
manager school where we take operators
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
and get them to be trained to be
 
01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
managers the future superintendents of
 
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
and then Jim talvey is our inspector he
 
01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
inspects all our hauling land
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
application and uh facilities like our
 
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
lagoons that we have oversight of with
 
01:25:22.010 --> 01:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
the permit system
 
01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
so just real quick you know prior to the
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
Clean Water Act our Rivers were quite
 
01:25:27.169 --> 01:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
contaminated if you're old enough to
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
understand what the Cuyahoga River is
 
01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
that thing was on fire in Ohio uh this
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
incident really created the need for the
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
EPA before this the EPA wasn't around
 
01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
and the Clean Water Act soon began
 
01:25:41.810 --> 01:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
discussion of the Clean Water Act about
 
01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
this and this is really how EPA came to
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
be what they are today but as you can
 
01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
see the Cuyahoga River was full of
 
01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
pollution so it wasn't the bay uh New
 
01:25:53.570 --> 01:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
York near Ellis Island
 
01:25:56.570 --> 01:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
we also had local Rivers uh Merrimack
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
was the Merrimack River was deemed one
 
01:25:59.689 --> 01:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
of the most polluted rivers in new uh
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
the country back before the Clean Water
 
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
Act you can see here a couple main
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
rivers where there's some paper mills
 
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
discharging directly into the surface
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
water prior before any treatment was
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
ever put onto the system
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
but what did the Clean Water Act do it
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
began to clean up our surface water
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
bodies and did a great job doing that
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
we're now able to recreate on these
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
surface water bodies and we even have
 
01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
now drinking water supplies that exist
 
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
on these Rivers themselves and you can
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
see here president uh former President
 
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:28.860 align:start position:0%
Reagan back in 1984 in the State of the
 
01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
Union Address made a very valid point
 
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
preservation of our environment is not a
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
liberal or conservative challenge it is
 
01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
common sense this is not a political
 
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
situation is really about us and the
 
01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:41.639 align:start position:0%
people that we live with
 
01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
so the rules and laws that we work with
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
for residuals management and Wastewater
 
01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
Management in the state we have our
 
01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
Clean Water Act which was passed in 1972
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
RSA 485 which is the water pollution and
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
waste disposal act which I'm sure you
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
all are aware of that was passed in 1990
 
01:26:57.649 --> 01:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
for federal regulations under the Clean
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
Water Act section 405-d it specifically
 
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
states that the department EPA is to
 
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
develop rules and regulations on the
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
management of sludge those are your 40
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
CFR part 503 rules you'll often hear
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
them called the 503 regulations
 
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire we have two rule sets
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
for the management of sludge and septic
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
envwq 800 is our sludge management rules
 
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
and emvwq 1600 is our septage management
 
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
rules we do have two different
 
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
Management Systems there because septage
 
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
is not when you're managing septids
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
prior to a wastewater treatment facility
 
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
it definitely needs to have its own
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
oversight and different regulations but
 
01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
they are similar uh and if you look at
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
it from a higher level
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
so some of the efforts that we have uh
 
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
done this year we have our or in the
 
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
last few years our sludge quality
 
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
certification investigation for pfas has
 
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
been going on since 2017. again I joined
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
DES in 2018 uh back in 2019 is when I
 
01:27:57.229 --> 01:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
revised everybody's such quality
 
01:27:58.729 --> 01:27:58.739 align:start position:0%
certificate to state that you are to
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
monitor for pfas annually at that time
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
we were only looking at nine compounds
 
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
because that's all the labs could
 
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
analyze for today I can get a list of 24
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
up to 40 and even up to 70. your method
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
from the EPA the multi-lab validated
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
method that will be for soils and sludge
 
01:28:18.250 --> 01:28:18.260 align:start position:0%
will be a list of 40 compounds
 
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
we also created the Northeast biosolid
 
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
Improvement program that is a national
 
01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
group now we have multiple State
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
Regulators Engineers operators Managers
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
from all sides of the industry coming
 
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
together to create education Outreach
 
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at here is part of
 
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:37.139 align:start position:0%
one of our brochures we created for the
 
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:39.300 align:start position:0%
public to talk about how pfas is
 
01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
conveyed through the Wastewater system
 
01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
and not a source in a Wastewater plan is
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
not the source of pfas in fact it's the
 
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
victim of pfas from industry and
 
01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:50.209 align:start position:0%
victim of pfas from industry and
residence

01:28:50.209 --> 01:28:50.219 align:start position:0%
residence
 
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
this is another part of the brochure
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
that we created to educate our operators
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
and septic haulers in the state to
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
understand why is the septage or why are
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
why is there more sampling happening at
 
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
the Wastewater Plant and the difference
 
01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
between the sampling that they've done
 
01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
in the past and the sampling that
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
they'll do in the future because this
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
now involves clean water sampling
 
01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
protocols where they have to pay
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
attention to what they're wearing if any
 
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
of you are wearing makeup lotion or any
 
01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
other health and beauty care products
 
01:29:18.290 --> 01:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
today you might be contributing pfas to
 
01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
the Wastewater system when you wash it
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
off your face at night
 
01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
and that's what they have to be careful
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
of when they're sampling for because
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
they can cross contaminate the sample
 
01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
with that material that might be on
 
01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
their body on their hands on their
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
clothes that then can transfer back into
 
01:29:33.649 --> 01:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
the sample
 
01:29:36.110 --> 01:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
we've also again educated the public on
 
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
what is pfas and how does it impact
 
01:29:39.410 --> 01:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
Wastewater systems and sludge Management
 
01:29:41.629 --> 01:29:41.639 align:start position:0%
systems and then what they can do to POS
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
possibly reduce those concentrations
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
there's a website called
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
pfastcentral.org it has an awesome
 
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
Banner at the top it educates you on
 
01:29:50.330 --> 01:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
what you can buy that doesn't contain
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
pfas meaning you're cleaning chemicals
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
your clothes and things like that so you
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
can make the effort personally at home
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
to try to reduce those loadings I'm
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
going to show you some data here that'll
 
01:30:02.090 --> 01:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
show you how residents are discharging
 
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
pfas into the Wastewater system and it
 
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
might be actually of a concern since a
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
residents are the mass loading onto a
 
01:30:10.729 --> 01:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
we've also done some articles with NPR
 
01:30:14.930 --> 01:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
and other media Outlets if you remember
 
01:30:17.330 --> 01:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
last fall if you saw last fall I was the
 
01:30:19.129 --> 01:30:19.139 align:start position:0%
subject of marhopal Mason's article on
 
01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
what we're doing for pfas regulation
 
01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:23.219 align:start position:0%
standard development what Jeff just
 
01:30:25.010 --> 01:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
explained to you uh this was a great
 
01:30:26.689 --> 01:30:26.699 align:start position:0%
article I worked with Mara all year long
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
on this uh took the A out to our sample
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
sites also took they out to our farm
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
field where we did the phase three part
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
of the study at one of our biosolid
 
01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:39.229 align:start position:0%
of the study at one of our biosolid
sites

01:30:39.229 --> 01:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
sites
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
so I want to give you some quick numbers
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
on sludge and septage management in the
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
state we recycle approximately over 40
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
000 wet tons of biosolids from the
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facilities in New
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's quite a few towns that
 
01:30:55.010 --> 01:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
are reliant on this permit program uh if
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
you're representing a town or community
 
01:30:57.770 --> 01:30:57.780 align:start position:0%
and your interest is to know if you are
 
01:30:59.330 --> 01:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
recycling come ask me and I'll let you
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
know but there are quite a few
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
we landfill about 50 000 wet tons of
 
01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
biosolers or sludge annually we call
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
that sludge because it's not treated so
 
01:31:12.169 --> 01:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
we're cycling about 35 percent of the
 
01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
sludge that's generated in the state
 
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
we're making we're managing or creating
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
about a hundred over a little over a
 
01:31:20.689 --> 01:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand wet tons annually on a
 
01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
250 Day schedule that's almost 13
 
01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
tractor trailer trucks per day
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
um of sludge that needs to be managed
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's a landfill incinerated or
 
01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
land applied
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
we're also managing over 100 million
 
01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
gallons of septage annually that's being
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
hauled around by our septic haulers and
 
01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
brought to a Wastewater Plant or a
 
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
permanent facility if you don't know 80
 
01:31:43.610 --> 01:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
about 85 percent of the state is on
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
septic systems so this is a very
 
01:31:47.209 --> 01:31:47.219 align:start position:0%
important Management program and a very
 
01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
important program to keep an eye on to
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that all the SEPTA is just
 
01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
properly being disposed at the right
 
01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:53.090 align:start position:0%
properly being disposed at the right
place

01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
as for our six operating line landfills
 
01:31:57.290 --> 01:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
in the state we are generating over 100
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
million gallons of leachate annually
 
01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
that is mostly being managed in the
 
01:32:03.890 --> 01:32:03.900 align:start position:0%
state at our local wastewater treatment
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
facilities if you're unaware leachate
 
01:32:08.090 --> 01:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
that's generated at a landfill has to go
 
01:32:10.129 --> 01:32:10.139 align:start position:0%
to a wastewater treatment facility to be
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
further processed and then discharged to
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
the surface water body or groundwater if
 
01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
that Wastewater Plant has a rapid
 
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
infiltration Basin which is discharges
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
into the ground so quite a bit of
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
leachate has to be managed in the state
 
01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
still if you remember a few years ago
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
there was an article about the Lowell
 
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
Wastewater facility taking New Hampshire
 
01:32:32.810 --> 01:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
leachate after that article they quickly
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
stopped taking that leachate and now
 
01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
that leachate is going to New Jersey to
 
01:32:38.330 --> 01:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
be treated so they're shipping their
 
01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
leachate about eight hours down the road
 
01:32:44.090 --> 01:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
to be treated at a Wastewater Plant
 
01:32:45.530 --> 01:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to show you here is the
 
01:32:47.450 --> 01:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
beginning of our investigation I start
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
with the collection system meaning we go
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
out and Sample the sewer shed out in the
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
streets we pop manholes we go into pump
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
stations and we do different sampling
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
methods to see what we can find in the
 
01:32:59.810 --> 01:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
Wastewater and we're looking for General
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
sources of pfas entering the Wastewater
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
stream via industry or the public when
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
we do this we aren't pinpointing
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
specific businesses we are actually
 
01:33:11.689 --> 01:33:11.699 align:start position:0%
looking at general areas so if there's a
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
parking lot that has a bunch of box
 
01:33:15.410 --> 01:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
stores we're sampling that pump station
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
so it's not specifically one business
 
01:33:19.490 --> 01:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
there may be and here you may see a
 
01:33:21.169 --> 01:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
school here or there there was a pump
 
01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
station that we did sample for a high
 
01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
school and there were a couple of other
 
01:33:27.410 --> 01:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
entities beyond that what you're seeing
 
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
here right now is a community this is
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
Sunapee New Hampshire they have the more
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
higher concentration of pfas in their
 
01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
sludge which had me wondering why it's
 
01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
mostly a residential Community with not
 
01:33:39.410 --> 01:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
much industry so we went around and
 
01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
sampled the residential communities of
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
this system and what this is is tapas so
 
01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
it's total oxidizable precursor assay
 
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
and what they're doing is they're
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
measuring the pfas in the sample and
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
then they're oxidizing the sample and
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
then re-measuring it again by oxidizing
 
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
the sample what they're doing is
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
breaking up all those precursors Jeff's
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
just talked about the ones that we can't
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
see in the normal test method and
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
exposing them and then we're able to see
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
what is really the concentration of per
 
01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
se pfos and pfoa
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
so you'll see on this chart pre and post
 
01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
and the letter before that is means it's
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
the same sample so when we sample the
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
normal test method that is used today we
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
don't see it and we go okay it's not
 
01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
coming from residence but then if we do
 
01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
top assay all of a sudden it exposes the
 
01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
amount of precursors that a home is
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
discharging meaning it could be coming
 
01:34:31.370 --> 01:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
off your makeup your lotions your soaps
 
01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
your laundry detergent your clothes we
 
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
just don't know because the sds's that
 
01:34:37.490 --> 01:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
are out there for products that are sold
 
01:34:40.490 --> 01:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
to us don't indicate if pfas is in it
 
01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
because it's at such a small
 
01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:43.860 align:start position:0%
concentration they don't legally have to
 
01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
do that and if they do then they usually
 
01:34:48.169 --> 01:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
typically say it's proprietary or trade
 
01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
secrets so we don't even know what
 
01:34:51.410 --> 01:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
products we're buying off the shelf
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
contain pfas and what those
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
concentrations are but as you can see
 
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
here uh there is a contribution from
 
01:34:59.330 --> 01:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
residents and it goes all the way up to
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
600 parts per trillion this is not parts
 
01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
per billion this is parts per trillion I
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
will show you sludge data in a sec that
 
01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
is parts per billion just like Soil and
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
Water you will find soil sludge and
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
parts per billion you'll find water in
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion so this was
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
concerning to me this actually started
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
to say there's actually a different
 
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
picture being painted where it's not
 
01:35:20.209 --> 01:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
just industry just charging pfas into
 
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
our collection systems is also us
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
this right here is a different Community
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
this is North Conway we've gone out and
 
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
done various other communities and we're
 
01:35:30.169 --> 01:35:30.179 align:start position:0%
going to continue doing this with the
 
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
the money that we're getting from
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
legislation to continue our
 
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
investigation this is North Conway so
 
01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
you can see here this resident loading
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
is very similar to uh Sunapee if you
 
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
look at the scale below the scale is
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
obviously much higher because I actually
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
went and sampled some industry and
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
Commercial areas of this community
 
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
this next sample was actually very
 
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
alarming to me because this is the high
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
school Pump Station
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
this means that the high school is
 
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
discharging quite a bit of pfas into the
 
01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
collection system that is zorbing onto
 
01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
the sludge hence contaminating the
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
sludge in the Wastewater
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
we're finding through other
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
investigations that this is coming out
 
01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
of the cleaning chemicals the floor
 
01:36:05.810 --> 01:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
strippers and floor waxes that they're
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
using at these schools and also is
 
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
coming off of the surfaces that the
 
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
school has through the studies that are
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
drinking water groundwater Bureau has
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
done with these uh constituents so this
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
is alarming uh because we do have a lot
 
01:36:20.450 --> 01:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
of schools in the state that have
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
drinking water wells and septic systems
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
and they are now on granulated activated
 
01:36:27.010 --> 01:36:27.020 align:start position:0%
carbon for those Drinking Water Systems
 
01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
curiosity I have for Wastewater is is a
 
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
septic system doing this or not we don't
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
know we need more data
 
01:36:35.930 --> 01:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
um do you want to wait till after okay
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:39.179 align:start position:0%
yeah please
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at here is leachate
 
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh this community actually has a
 
01:36:45.169 --> 01:36:45.179 align:start position:0%
circular system with their sludge and
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
their leachate they have a landfill and
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
then they generate sludge from their
 
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
their Wastewater Plant the sludge is
 
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
land filled and the leachate goes back
 
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
to the Wastewater Plant there's not many
 
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
of these types of systems in New
 
01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because uh our sludge and our
 
01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
leachate and our go in multiple
 
01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
different directions on different days
 
01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
but this system is pretty pretty unique
 
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
so what you're seeing here is that
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
there's not much of difference between
 
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
the pre and the post so the leachate is
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
probably oxidizing through the landfill
 
01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
exposing all those precursors to what
 
01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
they are but there is a loading of uh
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
leachate on here we now have some
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
research going on where this community
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
is actually going to look at how could
 
01:37:24.169 --> 01:37:24.179 align:start position:0%
they potentially treat the leachate
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
before it hits the headworks of the
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant hopefully reducing this
 
01:37:31.129 --> 01:37:31.139 align:start position:0%
loading at least from the leachate
 
01:37:33.110 --> 01:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
this is what we see in the influent and
 
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
effluent of the Wastewater Plant so if
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
you were to do the standard analysis
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
today you wouldn't see it in the
 
01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
influent but if you do it on the
 
01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
effluent you would see it so that
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
initially brought the conversation of a
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant is generating pfas it
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
is not it is conveying it through the
 
01:37:50.090 --> 01:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
system because a Wastewater Plant is not
 
01:37:51.890 --> 01:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
designed to treat emerging contaminants
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's designed to treat the solids and
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
the pathogens that are present in the
 
01:37:58.490 --> 01:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
Wastewater separating out the two
 
01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
discharging clean water to the surface
 
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
water body and creating sludge so this
 
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
top assay really exposes how there is a
 
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
lot of unknown pfas entering into the
 
01:38:11.930 --> 01:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant through systems like
 
01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
the school or residents or even
 
01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
businesses as you can see on this chart
 
01:38:18.830 --> 01:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
there are other larger ones the
 
01:38:21.649 --> 01:38:21.659 align:start position:0%
commercial LR that is your Home Depot
 
01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
and Walmart location and then your LS
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
gsmh that other higher number that is a
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
hotel and Retail center of North Conway
 
01:38:34.189 --> 01:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
so as residents and just retail so no
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
industry or any type of Agriculture or
 
01:38:38.930 --> 01:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
01:38:40.850 --> 01:38:40.860 align:start position:0%
next I want to show you the sludge data
 
01:38:42.590 --> 01:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
that we've generated so this is just
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
last year's data I have data which I'll
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
show you in a sec that goes all the way
 
01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
back to 2017. as you can see on the
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
bottom this is in parts per billion so
 
01:38:53.450 --> 01:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
the highest concentration we find in
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
class A biosolids right now is a little
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
over six parts per billion for pfos it's
 
01:38:59.570 --> 01:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
a little over four parts per billion and
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
for pfna and pfhxs it does not meet or
 
01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:05.699 align:start position:0%
meets one part per billion as you see
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
there's different generators here some
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
of this biosolids is strictly for Farm
 
01:39:11.689 --> 01:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
fields and some is allowed to be land
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
applied on your golf course on your
 
01:39:15.770 --> 01:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
ballpark and potentially on your lawn if
 
01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
you choose to work with that Company
 
01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
Merrimack is on here Hawk Ridge is on
 
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
here those are both in vessel compost
 
01:39:24.110 --> 01:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
systems which I'm looking at because
 
01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
that energy that that composting does I
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
think breaks up a lot of these
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
precursors into those known pfas
 
01:39:31.129 --> 01:39:31.139 align:start position:0%
compounds we see
 
01:39:32.590 --> 01:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
but again
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
the maximum concentration we saw in
 
01:39:36.530 --> 01:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
phase one was about eight parts per
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
billion for pfos so this is six parts
 
01:39:41.689 --> 01:39:41.699 align:start position:0%
per billion just to take note
 
01:39:43.850 --> 01:39:43.860 align:start position:0%
for the class B biosolids we have three
 
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
generators and in fact the green line
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
that is our New Hampshire Des run
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
Wastewater facility the Winnipesaukee
 
01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
River Basin program they service 10
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
communities in the state and their
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
biosolids was typically land applied at
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
class B permanent sites but recently has
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
now being trucked down to Merrimack to
 
01:40:02.450 --> 01:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
their Compost Facility because their
 
01:40:04.490 --> 01:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
contract changed and the company that
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
was managing it doesn't manage it
 
01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
anymore to those Farm Fields so while I
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
have this in the class B numbers I want
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
to show you because the Winnipesaukee
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
River Basin program treatment is very
 
01:40:16.570 --> 01:40:16.580 align:start position:0%
much similar to the Nashua treatment
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
Nashua is the largest generator of
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
biosolids in the state they generate
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
about 9 000 wet tons annually due to the
 
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.189 align:start position:0%
about 9 000 wet tons annually due to the
population

01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
and down below is Plymouth they're a
 
01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
smaller Community they lime stabilize
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
their biosolids so they use Quick lime
 
01:40:33.649 --> 01:40:33.659 align:start position:0%
to kill the pathogens which is a higher
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
pH material which has to be paid
 
01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
attention in the field so you're not
 
01:40:38.810 --> 01:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
raising the pH too high
 
01:40:41.570 --> 01:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh this is short paper fiber coming from
 
01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
our paper mills so keep in mind that
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
scale the heart largest concentration we
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
see does not exceed 1.8 parts per
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
billion our paper mills today probably
 
01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
aren't using pfas like they used to or
 
01:40:56.689 --> 01:40:56.699 align:start position:0%
maybe just aren't using at all as you
 
01:40:58.970 --> 01:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
heard maybe in the news the main Farms
 
01:41:00.110 --> 01:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
that were contaminated might have been
 
01:41:02.209 --> 01:41:02.219 align:start position:0%
contaminated from paper sludge I think
 
01:41:03.770 --> 01:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
when you look at paper sludge you have
 
01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
to look at what is the paper mill making
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
and how much pfas could possibly be a
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
potential in that process the monado
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
paper mill this is the first time they
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
ever had a hit period with me this one
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
year their procurement program they're
 
01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
actually asking their vendors are you
 
01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
testing for pfas what are your numbers
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
can I see those and they're making a
 
01:41:23.810 --> 01:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
decision on what they're taking in for
 
01:41:25.850 --> 01:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
recycled feedstock based on those
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
constant conversations they took that
 
01:41:30.110 --> 01:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
from my training I gave them I wanted
 
01:41:32.570 --> 01:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
the plants to start that are taking in
 
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
outside waste to start understanding
 
01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
what's coming into the plant and start
 
01:41:37.850 --> 01:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
having those conversations and
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
potentially testing for it stupid
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing here is drinking
 
01:41:43.970 --> 01:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
water residuals we do allow drinking
 
01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
water sludge to be land applied it has
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
to be blended with soil to make a
 
01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
manufactured topsoil we don't allow it
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
to be directly land applied onto Farm
 
01:41:53.149 --> 01:41:53.159 align:start position:0%
Fields but again keep in mind that scale
 
01:41:56.330 --> 01:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
highest concentration goes to 1.8 part A
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
little over 1.8 part per billion
 
01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
so quickly I want to talk about the
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
future of sludge management
 
01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:03.410 align:start position:0%
future of sludge management
um

01:42:03.410 --> 01:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
we are looking at destruction Pathways
 
01:42:08.689 --> 01:42:08.699 align:start position:0%
and what is feasible and what could be
 
01:42:10.370 --> 01:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
done with our sludge in the future to
 
01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
better manage this material paralysis
 
01:42:14.450 --> 01:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
and gasification are two technologies
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
that seem to be pretty applicable to
 
01:42:19.010 --> 01:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
sludge sludge is a pretty complex Matrix
 
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
you just can't add on any technology to
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
it and have successful destruction but I
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
am seeing that paralysis is creating a
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
biochar that is completely free of pfas
 
01:42:30.649 --> 01:42:30.659 align:start position:0%
and in fact biochar has a value to the
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
market in California they're selling
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
biochar for about 300 a yard so a
 
01:42:37.729 --> 01:42:37.739 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant could potentially be
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
generating a material that's safe for
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
the environment and had creating a
 
01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
revenue source for themselves if they
 
01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
have this technology there are concerns
 
01:42:46.850 --> 01:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
about the air emissions of these
 
01:42:48.649 --> 01:42:48.659 align:start position:0%
Technologies so that's what we need to
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
look at if they were to burn and Destroy
 
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
This would they be emitting pfas into
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
the environment kind of like Saint
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
Cobain did but you could put scrubbing
 
01:42:58.729 --> 01:42:58.739 align:start position:0%
on that you could potentially have a
 
01:43:00.350 --> 01:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
scrubbing system that could treat that
 
01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
and potentially have that you might see
 
01:43:04.850 --> 01:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
one of these unit regionally I've heard
 
01:43:07.129 --> 01:43:07.139 align:start position:0%
grumblings that the Portland Water
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
District's interested in this and
 
01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
looking further into this and I've
 
01:43:13.330 --> 01:43:13.340 align:start position:0%
talked to these companies quite a bit
 
01:43:15.649 --> 01:43:15.659 align:start position:0%
they are interested in coming into New
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but they want to make sure
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
they have a business that's viable
 
01:43:19.970 --> 01:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
meaning they want to know that they're
 
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
if they put one of these units in they
 
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
have 20 30 years of business meaning
 
01:43:25.490 --> 01:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
that our sludge is contaminated enough
 
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
that it needs paralysis
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
this next section this last technology
 
01:43:31.370 --> 01:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk about is something
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
Jeff and I are really interested in uh
 
01:43:34.729 --> 01:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
we had them present to us last week in
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
our pfas coordinator meeting it's called
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
Electro coagulation it almost seems too
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
good to be true we want to look further
 
01:43:42.169 --> 01:43:42.179 align:start position:0%
into this one it doesn't have emissions
 
01:43:44.330 --> 01:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
like burning and incinerating but it
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
does actually destroy the sludge to a
 
01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
point where it takes away the pfas or
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
endocrine disruptors pathogens makes the
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
metals into oxide forms so that they are
 
01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
not leachable and actually allow and
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
destroys the uh it doesn't it takes the
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
volume of the sludge down 80 percent
 
01:44:02.689 --> 01:44:02.699 align:start position:0%
because most sludge is actually gas if
 
01:44:05.689 --> 01:44:05.699 align:start position:0%
you didn't know that and as well it
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
makes the sludge a better dewatered
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
material so you can get it drier if you
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
need to landfill it as you saw with the
 
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
numbers that are being recycled 40 000
 
01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
wet tons would not have a home today if
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
we were to cut off land application it
 
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
would have to be stockpiled or put in a
 
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
facility or sent out a state to be
 
01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
managed right now Canada was taking a
 
01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
lot of New Hampshire sludge they
 
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
recently they just Quebec said no or
 
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
they created a moratorium that is
 
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
reducing that sludge input and we're
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
hearing that New Brunswick is about to
 
01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:38.219 align:start position:0%
quickly follow suit because in Maine
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
they they did ban land applications
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
started sending it to the landfill and
 
01:44:43.729 --> 01:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
within six months the landfill said no
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
more they sent it to New Brunswick for
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
about two weeks and then New Brunswick
 
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
said we can't do this now they're
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
talking about railing it down south uh
 
01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
from from Unity Maine because the
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
Compost Facility in Unity Maine has now
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
turned into an emergency stockpile
 
01:44:59.930 --> 01:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
location that has approval to do that
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
until August so we want to be careful on
 
01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
how we manage our sludge in the future
 
01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
we need to add Outlets to our management
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
system we right now it's a three-legged
 
01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
stool land application incineration and
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
landfilling if you take one of those
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
legs out you don't have a stool anymore
 
01:45:16.010 --> 01:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
there's a pun there if you want to think
 
01:45:17.090 --> 01:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
and we need to add a lake we need to add
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
a fourth leg and a fifth leg and maybe
 
01:45:23.689 --> 01:45:23.699 align:start position:0%
even a six leg because this material is
 
01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
always going to be generated as our
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
population increases we'll only have
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
more material to manage and our Farms
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
are definitely decreasing we are losing
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
our farms and the management of this
 
01:45:34.490 --> 01:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
material on our Farms Farmers may not
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
want this in the future so we need to
 
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
start thinking about where does this go
 
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
and how do we manage it and how do we
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
successfully manage it as a state
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
nope and this is in the dot parking lot
 
01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
I think this is very appropriate for all
 
01:45:49.129 --> 01:45:49.139 align:start position:0%
of us
 
01:45:52.609 --> 01:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
um thank you Michelle thank you thanks
 
01:45:56.570 --> 01:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions so I have a
 
01:45:58.250 --> 01:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
couple of questions uh the first
 
01:46:00.410 --> 01:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
question was regarding surfaces at
 
01:46:03.050 --> 01:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
schools you mentioned uh quote surfaces
 
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
can you expand on what you mean by that
 
01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
so from the study and I don't want to go
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
too deep into that because it's a
 
01:46:10.129 --> 01:46:10.139 align:start position:0%
different person I Des that has done
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
that study Jennifer Hoffman but what she
 
01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:15.179 align:start position:0%
found is that she would do the analysis
 
01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
of the chemicals used prior to floor
 
01:46:19.250 --> 01:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
stripping and waxing and then she would
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
measure the Wastewater of uh of that
 
01:46:25.729 --> 01:46:25.739 align:start position:0%
waxing event and also the water used as
 
01:46:26.930 --> 01:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
part of that so she had essentially
 
01:46:29.570 --> 01:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
three components when she looked at the
 
01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
signature of the pfas in the cleaning
 
01:46:33.649 --> 01:46:33.659 align:start position:0%
chemical and then the signature and the
 
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
Wastewater it was different
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
and it had Legacy signatures to it
 
01:46:41.570 --> 01:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
suggesting that it was pulling off wax
 
01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
off the floor the stripping was doing
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
its job but it was pulling off old wax
 
01:46:47.810 --> 01:46:47.820 align:start position:0%
that potentially wasn't stripped off
 
01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
from years past that had a different
 
01:46:51.950 --> 01:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
chemistry from those chemical companies
 
01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
as we regulate these chemicals further
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
you can imagine chemical Engineers are
 
01:46:58.129 --> 01:46:58.139 align:start position:0%
going to be changing the formulation of
 
01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
these compounds so they're not so
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
detectable from test methods but as we
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
now have tapa and other test messes we
 
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
can we can see those changes thank you
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
and the second question I had was that
 
01:47:13.209 --> 01:47:13.219 align:start position:0%
um I just briefly went on to your
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
pfastcentral.org recommendation which is
 
01:47:17.629 --> 01:47:17.639 align:start position:0%
great I think
 
01:47:19.010 --> 01:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
um and it's interesting there's a
 
01:47:21.890 --> 01:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
certain economic subset of of products
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
available that do not contain some of
 
01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:24.590 align:start position:0%
available that do not contain some of
these

01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
um the other question I did have around
 
01:47:28.729 --> 01:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
that was I did notice that there were
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
virtually no food products there that
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
disclosed whether or not they were using
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
hydrophobic Liners in their packaging
 
01:47:37.609 --> 01:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
that's a very a very good point I mean
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
we need to definitely look into that I
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
don't see many investigations happening
 
01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
about what is what is present in the
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
food packaging and how is it
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
transferring into the food and then as
 
01:47:48.770 --> 01:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
we know there's over or maybe you don't
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
know but there's over 450 species that
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
have pfas in their blood and we're
 
01:47:54.530 --> 01:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most impacted ones
 
01:47:55.850 --> 01:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be in our blood for the
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
rest of our lives it might be in your
 
01:47:58.370 --> 01:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
kids Bloods and your grandchildren's
 
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
blood if we don't start changing how we
 
01:48:02.689 --> 01:48:02.699 align:start position:0%
manage these materials uh so we could we
 
01:48:04.129 --> 01:48:04.139 align:start position:0%
we're releasing it you know through our
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
fecal matter and our urine uh every day
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
and are we eating more of it than we
 
01:48:11.090 --> 01:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
know I don't know that's that's what the
 
01:48:14.450 --> 01:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
science needs to show thank you
 
01:48:16.970 --> 01:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative NAB thank you madam chair
 
01:48:18.410 --> 01:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in this has been
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
very fascinating and troubling
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
um did you figure out what was going on
 
01:48:23.450 --> 01:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
in Sunapee did you come to any
 
01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
conclusions about their numbers
 
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
um so when I look at Sunapee I to
 
01:48:31.010 --> 01:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
further investigate we need to have them
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
do more investigations on different
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
parts of the collection system
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
um I think residents are a problem uh
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
there's a recent article to come out
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
about toilet paper and actually toilet
 
01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
paper has a lot of pfas in it and so uh
 
01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
the article that I've read said that it
 
01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
could be a problem that was in the
 
01:48:48.890 --> 01:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
conclusion so with some of this funding
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
that we're getting in the future here I
 
01:48:52.010 --> 01:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
am going to be doing a toilet paper
 
01:48:54.350 --> 01:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
study uh pulling toilet paper off the
 
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
shelves of New Hampshire stores and
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
doing different dilution factors
 
01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
obviously if you have kids you might be
 
01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
discharging more toilet paper than if
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
you don't have kids uh and I want to
 
01:49:06.109 --> 01:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
kind of see what that looks like and
 
01:49:07.850 --> 01:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
maybe is that is that a mass loading
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
that we should be concerned about and
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
maybe legislation could look into uh how
 
01:49:14.450 --> 01:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
is this man how is pfas used in Toyota
 
01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
favorite isn't needed and what it could
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
be a good substitute for that and then
 
01:49:20.570 --> 01:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
wipes I don't want to bring up the topic
 
01:49:22.370 --> 01:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
but wipes could obviously be an issue as
 
01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:26.290 align:start position:0%
but wipes could obviously be an issue as
well

01:49:26.290 --> 01:49:26.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:49:29.810 --> 01:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
um I have a lot of questions that I'm
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
not we weren't we won't be able to cover
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
all of them uh I think one of the
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's interesting to
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
me is the the electrocoagulation because
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
it sounds like that might be a a really
 
01:49:45.530 --> 01:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
promising technology and I'm wondering
 
01:49:49.370 --> 01:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
uh how far away that is from getting up
 
01:49:52.250 --> 01:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
to scale so I am also very interested in
 
01:49:54.590 --> 01:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
the longevity and sustainability of that
 
01:49:57.050 --> 01:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
technology it does use metal plates in
 
01:49:59.330 --> 01:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
its treatment the metal plates do
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
deteriorate 0.2 pounds every one
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
thousand gallons so you can imagine
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
they're changing out the plates in that
 
01:50:08.090 --> 01:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
electrolysis bath daily what is the raw
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
material availability it's an iron and
 
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
aluminum plate there's quite a bit of
 
01:50:12.169 --> 01:50:12.179 align:start position:0%
iron and aluminum in our environment
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
however if every single Wastewater Plant
 
01:50:15.770 --> 01:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
started putting this into their lines
 
01:50:17.689 --> 01:50:17.699 align:start position:0%
what would that demand and Supply look
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
like as for the technology itself what
 
01:50:22.370 --> 01:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
we've been told from this one company
 
01:50:24.649 --> 01:50:24.659 align:start position:0%
they have 150 units worldwide they have
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
units within the country I am interested
 
01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:29.699 align:start position:0%
on the safety of the equipment luckily
 
01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and our 700
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
regulations if you're to implement
 
01:50:34.250 --> 01:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
anything into a Wastewater Plant that is
 
01:50:36.530 --> 01:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
new it has to go through a trial to
 
01:50:38.209 --> 01:50:38.219 align:start position:0%
determine if it is going to be safe for
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
The Operators is it going to perform the
 
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
way it does and then what is that
 
01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.890 align:start position:0%
way it does and then what is that
outcome

01:50:44.890 --> 01:50:44.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:47.090 --> 01:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:50:50.689 --> 01:50:50.699 align:start position:0%
from an agricultural standpoint with the
 
01:50:54.890 --> 01:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
use of biosolids and other items
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
will that leachate into the plants if
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
there are pfaps or pfoas in that
 
01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
biosolid so there is literature review
 
01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
to say that plants do uptake pfas one
 
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
thing about agriculture is that
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
biosolids aren't the only thing being
 
01:51:11.450 --> 01:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
spread on a farm field that might
 
01:51:13.970 --> 01:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
contain pfas we haven't looked into
 
01:51:15.290 --> 01:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
manure yet we haven't looked into
 
01:51:17.330 --> 01:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
herbicides yet I'm even curious about
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
osmocote fertilizer which is your coated
 
01:51:22.490 --> 01:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
nitrogen fertilizer a lot of things that
 
01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
are used on a farm field that definitely
 
01:51:25.609 --> 01:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
have not been part of my investigation
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
because I don't have oversight of that
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
material if we were to look into
 
01:51:31.850 --> 01:51:31.860 align:start position:0%
cropping and crop uptake I would we
 
01:51:33.290 --> 01:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
definitely need Department of AGS
 
01:51:35.330 --> 01:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
involvement and maybe even usda's
 
01:51:37.490 --> 01:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
involvement as Maine in their
 
01:51:39.169 --> 01:51:39.179 align:start position:0%
investigation at their biosolid sites
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
they did include Department of Ag and
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
they did include other agencies and
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
sections of the department to properly
 
01:51:47.090 --> 01:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
look at these sites so we can't exclude
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
everything else that is put on a farm
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
field but there's definitely questions
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
about what is up being uptaken between
 
01:51:56.930 --> 01:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
maybe corn silage grain corn hay Rye
 
01:51:58.970 --> 01:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
soybean and all those other crops
 
01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
typically our biosolids on an
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
agricultural setting are only growing
 
01:52:05.450 --> 01:52:05.460 align:start position:0%
feed for Animals you don't see really
 
01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
any Farmers using biosolids that are
 
01:52:09.229 --> 01:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
growing human consumption crops and
 
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
that's primarily because if their
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
customers found out they were using
 
01:52:13.850 --> 01:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
biosols they probably wouldn't buy their
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
vegetables so a lot of times they use
 
01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
animal manure or leaf and laundry
 
01:52:21.729 --> 01:52:21.739 align:start position:0%
compost but mostly commercial fertilizer
 
01:52:24.290 --> 01:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative come to our well thank
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair so it's my
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
interesting uh that in order to really
 
01:52:32.090 --> 01:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
delve into the agricultural side of this
 
01:52:34.850 --> 01:52:34.860 align:start position:0%
we need you need to we need to partner
 
01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Agriculture is
 
01:52:39.169 --> 01:52:39.179 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct I I you
 
01:52:41.689 --> 01:52:41.699 align:start position:0%
know if we look at a farm field that is
 
01:52:43.609 --> 01:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
received biosolids it has not just
 
01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
received biosolids so you automatically
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
really have to look into
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
Department of AG in my section we
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
regulate the soil the sludge and then we
 
01:52:54.169 --> 01:52:54.179 align:start position:0%
have as a department we regulate
 
01:52:56.450 --> 01:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
groundwater our rules and laws do not
 
01:52:58.609 --> 01:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
regulate crops that is under the
 
01:53:00.649 --> 01:53:00.659 align:start position:0%
agricultural cultural laws so that would
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
under be under oversight yeah one last
 
01:53:05.689 --> 01:53:05.699 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you so but would your
 
01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
department is assist in looking at
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
manure and how that is affecting and
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
what the Pfaff levels and pfoa levels
 
01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
are in that absolutely I mean I I'm the
 
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
guy that would probably have to train
 
01:53:19.129 --> 01:53:19.139 align:start position:0%
them on how to do that sampling and I
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
probably would be the guy that would do
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
that sampling uh I am pretty much known
 
01:53:25.609 --> 01:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
as a sludge sampler around the around
 
01:53:28.370 --> 01:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
the region and Country now uh I have no
 
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
fear when it comes to material like that
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
so I I enjoy training people I did get
 
01:53:34.129 --> 01:53:34.139 align:start position:0%
an award last year from the EPA on
 
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
training due to this compound so I
 
01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
thoroughly enjoy training others on how
 
01:53:40.850 --> 01:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
to properly sample for this material
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
congratulations representative coulon
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
it seems like if I'm looking at your
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
Solutions part that
 
01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:50.930 align:start position:0%
Solutions part that
um

01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
it looks like you're considering more
 
01:53:55.850 --> 01:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
like independent
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
ways that New Hampshire can
 
01:54:00.590 --> 01:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
independently deal with waste inside our
 
01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
own State as opposed to selling it to
 
01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:05.820 align:start position:0%
other states or other countries an
 
01:54:07.370 --> 01:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
interesting thing to keep in mind about
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
sludge is that it doesn't have real
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
state orders in the management system of
 
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
it the interstate commerce law allows
 
01:54:14.330 --> 01:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
for the material to cross state lines
 
01:54:16.729 --> 01:54:16.739 align:start position:0%
and be managed in other states I think
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
as a state though we really need to look
 
01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
at them how do we look at the management
 
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
for our Wastewater plants we have almost
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
a little over 70 Wastewater plants in
 
01:54:27.169 --> 01:54:27.179 align:start position:0%
this state that are operating under
 
01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
Nifty permits that are uh have oversight
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
from the EPA so if we are able to offer
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
those Technologies to those Wastewater
 
01:54:36.649 --> 01:54:36.659 align:start position:0%
plants they may have a safer and more
 
01:54:39.410 --> 01:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
sustainable future for the management of
 
01:54:42.410 --> 01:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
that sludge as for an entity that would
 
01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
manage that destruction and that type of
 
01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
system private sector seems to be having
 
01:54:49.729 --> 01:54:49.739 align:start position:0%
all the solutions right now I don't know
 
01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
if we'd be able to support another
 
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
facility next to our state-run
 
01:54:55.370 --> 01:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
Wastewater plan or anything like that
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
but the these private companies are
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
coming in with new technologies and
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
introducing it to us so they seem to be
 
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
working hard on that solution
 
01:55:06.410 --> 01:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thanks again so I
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
have an interesting question to sort of
 
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
think about
 
01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
um part of the solution obviously you
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
are saying that as household
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
it seems that the the evidence suggests
 
01:55:20.689 --> 01:55:20.699 align:start position:0%
that there's a large portion of pfas
 
01:55:23.570 --> 01:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
coming out from households to that end I
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
think a really important component of
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
this is having the ability for consumers
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
to know what they're purchasing and
 
01:55:34.370 --> 01:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
um I am really concerned that maybe that
 
01:55:36.169 --> 01:55:36.179 align:start position:0%
sort of full picture isn't there for
 
01:55:37.970 --> 01:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
folks yeah definitely the source
 
01:55:39.649 --> 01:55:39.659 align:start position:0%
pollution prevention is is the bigger
 
01:55:41.689 --> 01:55:41.699 align:start position:0%
way we're going to or the easiest and I
 
01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
think the most efficient way where
 
01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to reduce these
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
concentrations in our collection system
 
01:55:48.530 --> 01:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
uh as like I said sludge Wastewater and
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
Wastewater plants are the victim they're
 
01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
not the suspect and so if we as people
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
in an industry can discharge less pfas
 
01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
into that collection system we are now
 
01:55:58.729 --> 01:55:58.739 align:start position:0%
going to have to manage less at a
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
municipal system at a public facility
 
01:56:05.689 --> 01:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
and so if we look at uh controlling the
 
01:56:08.570 --> 01:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
Commerce of pfas that is definitely a
 
01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
way to reduce that the labeling of pfas
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
is definitely a way to get people to
 
01:56:16.370 --> 01:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
understand what they're buying
 
01:56:19.250 --> 01:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
um and and as I said on sds's or what
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
are formerly called msds's pfas is used
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
at such a small concentration it
 
01:56:25.129 --> 01:56:25.139 align:start position:0%
technically doesn't have to be on the
 
01:56:27.649 --> 01:56:27.659 align:start position:0%
SDS so you don't have to disclose that
 
01:56:30.890 --> 01:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yeah so um one of
 
01:56:38.890 --> 01:56:38.900 align:start position:0%
another aspect I'm wondering about is uh
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
pfas and compost because uh with uh
 
01:56:48.050 --> 01:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
composting is now not just uh Leaf in a
 
01:56:49.970 --> 01:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
sort of yard waste but it is also
 
01:56:54.169 --> 01:56:54.179 align:start position:0%
involves some combination of animal
 
01:56:58.270 --> 01:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
waste and also food waste and also uh
 
01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
the sort of
 
01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:01.990 align:start position:0%
the sort of
compostable

01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
compostable
 
01:57:05.290 --> 01:57:05.300 align:start position:0%
uh eating uh
 
01:57:09.290 --> 01:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
containers and uh and and uh
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
paper dishware which used to just be
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
landfilled but now could be composted
 
01:57:16.970 --> 01:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
and also like pizza boxes and that sort
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
of thing and I'm wondering uh how that
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh so uh have you done any investigation
 
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
of compost and how is that panned out so
 
01:57:29.330 --> 01:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
last fall I was able to go out and buy a
 
01:57:31.609 --> 01:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
few food waste compost bags at the
 
01:57:34.370 --> 01:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
general Garden store in New Hampshire it
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
was down in the south southern part of
 
01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:37.860 align:start position:0%
the state we looked at
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
um there were out of state generators
 
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
because technically there isn't really a
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
food waste composter selling bag
 
01:57:44.450 --> 01:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
products yet in New Hampshire these
 
01:57:45.850 --> 01:57:45.860 align:start position:0%
rules are pretty fresh
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
but we did look at that and we did do
 
01:57:50.209 --> 01:57:50.219 align:start position:0%
sampling and we we saw less
 
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
concentrations than what you see in
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
class A biosolids so it's suggesting
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
that food waste compost might not be as
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
impacted as biosolids are and that's
 
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
probably pretty true I would say I mean
 
01:58:04.250 --> 01:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
we definitely need to further that
 
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
investigation and look into other
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
products we looked at four there's
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
multiple different ones as from the
 
01:58:12.169 --> 01:58:12.179 align:start position:0%
fertilizer study commission we
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
understand there's about 800 registered
 
01:58:17.689 --> 01:58:17.699 align:start position:0%
fertilizers in the state and so how many
 
01:58:19.189 --> 01:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
of those are being sampled and looked at
 
01:58:22.609 --> 01:58:22.619 align:start position:0%
I think two what came about that so
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
um we you know when you look at these
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
investigations I sample the whole sqc
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
program I do equipment blanks and field
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
blanks to Quality check to make sure I
 
01:58:32.930 --> 01:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
am not cross-contaminating the sample so
 
01:58:34.970 --> 01:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at everything and I think
 
01:58:37.490 --> 01:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
you got to do that because wave pfas is
 
01:58:39.050 --> 01:58:39.060 align:start position:0%
so ubiquitous in our environment you
 
01:58:40.729 --> 01:58:40.739 align:start position:0%
really have to look it's Case by case
 
01:58:43.970 --> 01:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
and that could even go with soils
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
represent Haskins
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just a quick
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
comment as a member of the advisory
 
01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
committee of the Seacoast Public Health
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
Network I get all kinds of information
 
01:58:57.050 --> 01:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
about pfas a lot of us do
 
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
My Town got a grant to test private
 
01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:02.030 align:start position:0%
My Town got a grant to test private
Wells

01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
Wells
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
and I think that system is going to be
 
01:59:06.109 --> 01:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
very helpful
 
01:59:09.890 --> 01:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
I did notice a press release that um
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
10 private wells in the towns of Dalton
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
Whitefield and Bethlehem were also
 
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
tested and came out with 0.0 of whatever
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
combination they were testing so we have
 
01:59:28.729 --> 01:59:28.739 align:start position:0%
these pristine perennial bodies of water
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
in our state and we need to protect them
 
01:59:32.330 --> 01:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
because that's why people want to be
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
here and move their businesses here so
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
thanks for the work you're doing thank
 
01:59:38.689 --> 01:59:38.699 align:start position:0%
you that's our job as Des is to create
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
standards and regulations that support
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
the laws and that's what we're doing
 
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.550 align:start position:0%
the laws and that's what we're doing
today

01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
representative on
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so with the
 
01:59:50.930 --> 01:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
agricultural like land applications that
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
have received you know the sludge
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
dumping for like decades and decades are
 
01:59:59.629 --> 01:59:59.639 align:start position:0%
you testing the land themselves because
 
02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679 align:start position:0%
I know there's a lot of sites that have
 
02:00:04.490 --> 02:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
been receiving this stuff for like a
 
02:00:07.129 --> 02:00:07.139 align:start position:0%
long time so so we have uh phase three
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
was looking at an a triple F site and a
 
02:00:12.290 --> 02:00:12.300 align:start position:0%
biosolid site we sampled the white Farm
 
02:00:14.689 --> 02:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
facility or white Farm uh on Clinton
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
Street here that is a state-owned
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
property so that was pretty easy to get
 
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
permission to go out and do that the
 
02:00:22.609 --> 02:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
investigation has not happened at Farm
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
fields for a couple reasons a I don't
 
02:00:27.050 --> 02:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
have the staff manpower to go out and
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
start sampling every single farm field
 
02:00:30.649 --> 02:00:30.659 align:start position:0%
that's received biosolids we'd have to
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
probably develop an RFQ and have a
 
02:00:34.149 --> 02:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
company go out and do that
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
also as well we would have to get the
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
um we could go out and do the class B
 
02:00:41.570 --> 02:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
sites but the class A sites we'd have to
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
get permission from the property owner
 
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
because those aren't site permitted so
 
02:00:47.450 --> 02:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
that would involve a lot of work on that
 
02:00:49.010 --> 02:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
and that we just don't have the Manpower
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
for so we were able to focus on the
 
02:00:53.149 --> 02:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
sludge component of our program because
 
02:00:54.830 --> 02:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
that is the first part how is
 
02:00:57.050 --> 02:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
distributed and that's where we were uh
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
doing our sampling so if we do move
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
forward we would need some money to hire
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
a company to go out and do that that is
 
02:01:06.649 --> 02:01:06.659 align:start position:0%
quite a task to take on
 
02:01:06.659 --> 02:01:08.410 align:start position:0%
quite a task to take on
foreign

02:01:08.410 --> 02:01:08.420 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so um another
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
um question I have is about how leachate
 
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
from landfills is handled and is there
 
02:01:21.169 --> 02:01:21.179 align:start position:0%
some sort of pre-treatment so that that
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't get into so that pfas that might
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
be in that doesn't get into the
 
02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant or is the
 
02:01:29.410 --> 02:01:29.420 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant essentially
 
02:01:31.970 --> 02:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
getting loaded with what are P whatever
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
pfas might be in the leachate so uh the
 
02:01:37.070 --> 02:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
again a Wastewater Plant is not designed
 
02:01:39.169 --> 02:01:39.179 align:start position:0%
to treat for emerging contaminants so it
 
02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
is being loaded with pfas whatever's in
 
02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
that leachate it's being loaded with and
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's you know accumulating in the
 
02:01:45.530 --> 02:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
sludge or being present in the
 
02:01:48.530 --> 02:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
Wastewater effluent as it discharges so
 
02:01:50.990 --> 02:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
when we do look at treatment system
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
there is uh funding available now to
 
02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
Wastewater facilities that do accept
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
leachate to look into treatment systems
 
02:02:00.169 --> 02:02:00.179 align:start position:0%
that could treat that leachate like I
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
said North Conway is one of the
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
applicants for that funding we're very
 
02:02:05.810 --> 02:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
excited that they're willing to look
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
into this Jason Gagnon the
 
02:02:09.070 --> 02:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
superintendent there he's very proactive
 
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
on this subject matter and there are a
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
couple Technologies out there that could
 
02:02:14.930 --> 02:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
potentially do it we just haven't
 
02:02:16.129 --> 02:02:16.139 align:start position:0%
completely looked into it
 
02:02:18.169 --> 02:02:18.179 align:start position:0%
electrocoagulation would be one maybe
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
supercritical water oxidation could be
 
02:02:23.149 --> 02:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
another I'm not so sure paralysis and
 
02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
gasification are the Technologies for
 
02:02:27.050 --> 02:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
that media because that's a liquid media
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
and paralysis and gasification is a
 
02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:34.850 --> 02:02:34.860 align:start position:0%
I think if you did granule activated
 
02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:36.659 align:start position:0%
carbon on leachate you'd find that you'd
 
02:02:39.050 --> 02:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
be going through media pretty quick and
 
02:02:42.890 --> 02:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
it would clog that media really fast so
 
02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
the standard granulated activated carbon
 
02:02:46.729 --> 02:02:46.739 align:start position:0%
that can clean your your private well or
 
02:02:48.290 --> 02:02:48.300 align:start position:0%
your drinking water plant that's a
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
cleaner Matrix it can handle that uh as
 
02:02:53.209 --> 02:02:53.219 align:start position:0%
we know leachate is is the juice from
 
02:03:00.129 --> 02:03:00.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions no thank you oh
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative I I'm not looking for a
 
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
detailed answer now but
 
02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
um if you have ideas for legislation
 
02:03:13.609 --> 02:03:13.619 align:start position:0%
that might help you do your job better
 
02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
or more extensively I think our
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
committee would be happy to help you out
 
02:03:21.290 --> 02:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
with uh you know working on that looking
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
further into destruction is definitely
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
something we need to do researching it
 
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
more seeing what pathway is going to be
 
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
a viable outlet for New Hampshire or at
 
02:03:29.810 --> 02:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
least a safe outlet for our human health
 
02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
and the environment as our job we are
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
here to protect human health and the
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
environment so we want to make sure
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
whatever technology is coming into the
 
02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
state it is going to do its job and do
 
02:03:40.970 --> 02:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
its job safely so that would involve
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
trials potentially setting allowing
 
02:03:45.649 --> 02:03:45.659 align:start position:0%
these companies to come in and exhibit

commissioner to see if there are any

programs that might help them I'm
 
02:05:55.729 --> 02:05:55.739 align:start position:0%
wondering if they maybe
 
02:05:58.129 --> 02:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
um something through USDA that they may
 
02:05:59.930 --> 02:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
be able to get even a small business
 
02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
loan or something
 
02:06:05.089 --> 02:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
or FEMA I don't know
 
02:06:07.250 --> 02:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
um my question to them would be is do
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:12.050 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:06:12.050 --> 02:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
so I I will be responding to uh LaBelle
 
02:06:18.970 --> 02:06:18.980 align:start position:0%
wineries on on their issue
 
02:06:23.470 --> 02:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
I think that I don't know I I don't know
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
which category grapes fall into I know
 
02:06:29.570 --> 02:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
that there that apples do there is a
 
02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
USDA problem uh crop protection program
 
02:06:34.370 --> 02:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
for apples I don't know if there's one
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
that would cover grapes I suspect
 
02:06:37.729 --> 02:06:37.739 align:start position:0%
there's probably not one that covers
 
02:06:39.890 --> 02:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
hearty kiwis yeah
 
02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:41.510 align:start position:0%
hearty kiwis yeah

still have some retained bills but I
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
