executive departments and administration
 
00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
committee meeting um I would like to
 
00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
open up our hearing for House Bill
 
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
216 um and representative Maguire you're
 
00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 align:start position:0%
ready to
 
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
present good morning I'm Carol Maguire
 
00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 align:start position:0%
repr representing marac District 27 that
 
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
is Allenstown Dunbarton Epsom and
 
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
hookset and House Bill 26 fixes a glitch
 
00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 align:start position:0%
we discovered last year when we were
 
00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 align:start position:0%
dealing with people who are severely
 
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
injured on the
 
00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
job it
 
00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
deletes the
 
00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 align:start position:0%
requirement oh the limitation of one
 
00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
year of
 
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
um workers compensation that is credited
 
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
towards one retirement service not
 
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
income just service time
 
00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
and we I looked into that at the end of
 
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
the year and no one is quite sure where
 
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
that limitation came from it seems to be
 
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.949 align:start position:0%
that limitation came from it seems to be
rather

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 align:start position:0%
rather
 
00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and from the testimony
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
received last year there are very very
 
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
few people who are injured and out on
 
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
workers comp for more than in a year
 
00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
it's only the people who are grievously
 
00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 align:start position:0%
injured on the job someone who is in a
 
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
you know got run over by a snowplow or
 
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
got shot in action or something like
 
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
that it's not your your normal case
 
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
because uh most people are easily um
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
back on the job within a year it's only
 
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
these rare cases where they have M
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
multiple surgeries and lengthy
 
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
recuperation that they get hit
 
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
so the fiscal note in my opinion is a
 
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
bit exaggerated I don't know how many
 
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
people would be out
 
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.510 align:start position:0%
people would be out
on

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh on workers comp for more than a year
 
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
but I can't imagine it's
 
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
10% um so I think it's it there is going
 
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
to be some re reprogramming cost I agree
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
with that but the actual impact should
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
be much less than the uh the fiscal note
 
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
indicates and that's um that's it I'll
 
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I
 
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
can representative sers thank you madam
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
chair um representative
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
Maguire there seems to be some unknowns
 
00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 align:start position:0%
in this case like you're saying we don't
 
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
know how many people are out more than a
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
year is there any way we can find out
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
this information and what maybe the cost
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
would really
 
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
be uh probably not in any timely manner
 
00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 align:start position:0%
but we can certainly ask for how many
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
people have run into this limit at least
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
within the last few years
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
ask representative G gr thank you um
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire if my memory
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
serves correctly last year there were
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
only two people who had test
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
ified so that I don't and I believe that
 
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
they were the only two that would have
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
been eligible had this legislation been
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
implemented just we don't know that to
 
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
be absolutely true because it would not
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
have included say the person run over by
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
a snowplow it only included uh police
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
who were injured on shot on the job um
 
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
there we know of those it affected one
 
00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
of those two it we don't think it
 
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
affected the other um but there may well
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
past are there other questions
 
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you so
 
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
another question I have is uh how would
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
this affect
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh insurance rate basically a rate that
 
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
we pay or someone pays into uh work as
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
comp shouldn't affect it anyway in any
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
at all because these people are in
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
injured the workers comp system
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
determines that it's job related and
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
pays them from workers
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
comp uh the difference is that right now
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
after a year of workers comp for one
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
incident they no longer get service
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
towards their retirement it's purely in
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
the pension system workers's comp is
 
00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.469 align:start position:0%
the pension system workers's comp is
unaffected

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
it might in the only thing is that it
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
might possibly encourage somebody who's
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
been out
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
for uh TW 11 and a half months to stay
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
out a little longer on workers comp but
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
issue thank you and it's my
 
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that this is an early bill
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
so this will be going to finance as well
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
so we'll be able to they'll be able to
 
00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:27.639 align:start position:0%
ask some of those hard questions I'll
 
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
ask that they report on how many people
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
have run into the limit which is I think
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
the thing we want to find
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
out thank you and that representative
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
salers yeah thank you I'm just trying to
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
find out because I'm new at this Edna
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
and um work as comp and what type of
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
benefits uh employees have especially in
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
an accident like something like that on
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
the job I mean are there other benefits
 
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
available to the worker at that point
 
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what this is about extending
 
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
the extending the benefit here of
 
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
working comp more than I believe I
 
00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:02.630 align:start position:0%
working comp more than I believe I
believe

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
that and you'd have we have another bill
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
comp um applying to people in in the um
 
00:09:16.069 --> 00:09:16.079 align:start position:0%
in the pension system later on that'll
 
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
have some of those details but my
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is that uh their their
 
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
health benefits are continued while
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
they're on workers comp and they they
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
get the base payment from the workers
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
comp system of which I know nothing more
 
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
than that that it exists and some
 
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
employers at least will give a
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
supplement to the workers's comp amount
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
which is I believe fairly
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
low uh but that's up to the
 
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
employer and I don't don't know which
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
much so I have a question for you as
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
well um right the way that I'm reading
 
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
this is seems that if somebody was out
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
on workers compensation for two years
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
they would have one year of service
 
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
added to that pension but that other
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
year just wouldn't count towards the
 
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
pension the only impact this has is on
 
00:10:13.069 --> 00:10:13.079 align:start position:0%
calculating the years of service is that
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
correct yes the um the people that I'm
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
thinking of are probably not going to be
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
out on a year continuously this
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
the stories we got were that somebody
 
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
had surgery recovered went back to work
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
for a while and strengthened themselves
 
00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
and then had another surgery and went
 
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
out again so uh like you said it's the
 
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
only thing that should be affected is
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
retirement thank you any oh
 
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
Schmidt it's early yeah so I I think a
 
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
little bit of
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
historical information can be helpful
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
especially for people you represent
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
Sellers and others who are new to Edna
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
so we have been tinkering with the with
 
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
the retirement system and with the
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
workers comp and so forth
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
for about the the entire time I've been
 
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
on the committee which is 18 years okay
 
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
the first step was um for people who get
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
killed on the job uh that's most mostly
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
police or
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
firefighters who get killed on the job
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
okay and so we decided about 20 years
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
ago to uh to try to help those the
 
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
families because people get killed on
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
the job they're out of the picture right
 
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
it's their family that's harmed by the
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
loss of their loved one their spouse and
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
so forth so the the first decision made
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
was that we were going to
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
provide a death benefit for for people
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
who got killed on the job right and and
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh that was decided to be
 
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
$100,000 over the years that that that
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about roughly 20 years
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
there are very few people in that
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
category who get killed on the job okay
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
fortunately what fortun of course
 
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
fortunately um so the first question was
 
00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
where's that money going to come from
 
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
and the the
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
initial idea was to uh
 
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
to basically basically do that through
 
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
an insurance
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
policy but the thought was because there
 
00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
were so few people involved in that
 
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
category that the insurance companies
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
were still going to you know because the
 
00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
The Genius of insurance is you spread
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
the risk right if it's a very very small
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
number of people there's no there's no
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
insurance coming in from the thing to to
 
00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:06.519 align:start position:0%
uh to make
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
that profitable for the insurance
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
companies therefore they won't they
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
won't provide the service without
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
enormously High premiums so the decision
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
that was made was that the state would
 
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
provide that $100,000 benefit out of the
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
general fund because it's such a small
 
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
number of people and that's the way it's
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
working out the state pays that $100,000
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
out of the general fund be because the
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
number of people involved is so small
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
it's been next to nothing over the years
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
then we had a situation A couple of
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
years ago where we had a a very small
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
number of people who were grievously
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
injured or killed
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
intentionally we had a some of you who
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
who are from the central area who are
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
read the new the Manchester Union leader
 
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
in large numbers there was a police
 
00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:11.959 align:start position:0%
officer Dan dhy is his name um who was
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
shot at
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
intentionally like 14 times the the the
 
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
assassin uh shot at him 14 times and he
 
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
hit him six
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
times now ordinarily somebody who gets
 
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
shot six times is going to die right yes
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
um representative um I actually realized
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
that there may be some other people that
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
are here to testify on this and well
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
then and it would be good to get into
 
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
some of this as the committee is able to
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
discuss this as a committee but I do
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
want to check that I apprciate people to
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
testify let's hear from them okay but
 
00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:48.519 align:start position:0%
this is this is a different group of
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
people but they still are in comparable
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
situation so let's hear from them
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you representative
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
Schmidt are there any other questions
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
for chairman Maguire or sorry
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
much are there others who are interested
 
00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:18.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.749 --> 00:15:28.759 align:start position:0%
helpful who are you and if you could
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
give your name again um you just turned
 
00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:32.759 align:start position:0%
off the microphone when you pressed that
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
red was
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
off go ahead you can fill it out yeah um
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
my name is Mark kavar I'm Deputy counsel
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
and compliance officer for the New
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
system and uh one of my responsibilities
 
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
to complete the fiscal note
 
00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:52.519 align:start position:0%
worksheets and um in doing this one we
 
00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
reached out to the Department of Labor
 
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
to ask them if they had statistics that
 
00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
could provide us with the number of
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
people who
 
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
remain on weekly Indemnity benefits for
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
more than a year and they were unable to
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
provide that they said they do not
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
compile the data that way and so our
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
actuary had no choice except to pick a
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
starting point and that's the six months
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
10% parameters that are in the fiscal
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
note worksheet um it was just a starting
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
point I don't want to say it was
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
completely arbitrary it was fairly
 
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
conservative but the number that they
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
presented is fully scalable if you think
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's 5% cut the number in half if you
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
thinks it's three months instead of six
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
months cut the number in half so so it's
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
fully scalable if you have a different
 
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
opinion but again labor was unable to
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
provide the
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
information uh which would have been
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
very helpful I was hoping they could but
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
they they just I talked to the
 
00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
commissioner and they just don't um
 
00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
compile the data that way and the
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner on our Board of Trustees so
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
if they had it they would have given it
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
to us um just to speak to how workers
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
comp is treated by New Hampshire
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
retirement system when someone goes out
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
on workers comp they're entitled to
 
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:17.799 align:start position:0%
weekly Indemnity benefit that which is
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
60% of their average compensation over a
 
00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:22.839 align:start position:0%
period of time prior to the
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
injury um employers will sometimes
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
supplement that with the other 40%
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
because that money is paid by an
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
insurance company and not by the
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
employer it's not considered earnable
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
compensation and since the member is not
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
receiving any earnable compensation they
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
don't receive service credit and that's
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
why the current one-year rule is in I
 
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
don't know the history I look back I
 
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
it's been around for many many years I
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
don't know why they picked the one year
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
um but from you know it's a policy
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
question whether you want to extend it
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
uh we don't view it as being super
 
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
expensive and uh we we have no position
 
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
on whether it's a good or a bad idea but
 
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
there is a distinction between those who
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
were on a year and those who were on for
 
00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:12.039 align:start position:0%
more than a year now one thing I would
 
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
say is that a lot of people been on for
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
more than a year may be eligible to
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
apply for a work-related Disability
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
Pension and that's and a lot of them do
 
00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:24.039 align:start position:0%
after that point they said well I can't
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
go back to work and I'll apply for a
 
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
Disability Pension through nhrs so that
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's why you don't see a lot of cases
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
of people complaining that they because
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
at that
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
point um a lot of people also
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
will once they go on disability will
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
convert their weekly Indemnity benefit
 
00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.039 align:start position:0%
to a lumpsum settlement because when
 
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
you're on disability we offset your
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
disability benefit by the weekly
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
Indemnity benefit paid by workers
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
comp and so as soon as someone gets on
 
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
disability they lump some whatever
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
whatever the projected
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
course of years for further payments
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
that they agree to with the workers's
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
comp carrier because once they lump
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
Summit they we're not offsetting anymore
 
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
so it's much more valuable for them so
 
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:11.799 align:start position:0%
it kind of weeds out more people like
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
that as well um plus if anyone's
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
retiring they're not getting service
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
credit anymore anyways once you retire
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
but that's a reason why a lot of people
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
stop receiving weekly Indemnity benefits
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
because it's advantageous they can
 
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
retire under accidental benefit and and
 
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
then lump sum their payment with the uh
 
00:19:33.559 --> 00:19:34.750 align:start position:0%
then lump sum their payment with the uh
workers

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
workers
 
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
comp representative scitec do you have a
 
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:40.039 align:start position:0%
question two questions one is uh your
 
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
would you confirm that workers comp does
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
not contribute to earnable compensation
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
it is not earnable compensation because
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
and contributions are not paid on it by
 
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
the member or the employer because it's
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
not paid by the employer it's paid by
 
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
thank you would you mind insurance
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
company would you yes would you mind
 
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
repeating that offset business I'm not
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
sure I understood that our statute
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
provides that if you are receiving an
 
00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:10.039 align:start position:0%
accidental disability benefit meaning
 
00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
work related and you're receiving a
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
weekly Indemnity benefit from workers
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
comp we will offset your disability
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
benefit by the amount of the weekly
 
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.870 align:start position:0%
benefit by the amount of the weekly
Indemnity

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
Indemnity
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
benefit and I guess this has been around
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
for years and I guess the theory was
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
well you shouldn't be paid tce for the
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
same injury by two
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
different that's the theory I guess I
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't around when it went in place I've
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
seen various legislation in the past to
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
do away with that but they they haven't
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
passed um thank you uh representative
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
sellers yeah thank you so that offset is
 
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
that offset so that makes up the other
 
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
40% no no no so say they have a
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
disability benefit of 2500 a
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
month and work as comp's paying them a
 
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
th000 500 a week well we'd offset their
 
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
benefit by 2,000 a month by 500 a week
 
00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
times four so we offset the benefit the
 
00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:13.750 align:start position:0%
times four so we offset the benefit the
other

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
40% if paid by the employer and that's
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
optional like nashille firefighters I
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
know has it but it's not very common
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
it's called workers comps upal pay where
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
through CVA agreements they agree to pay
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
the other 40% to to make a person Hall
 
00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
60% from workers comp that is workers
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
that is um earnable compensation and
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
that's what the other bill is about
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
because we it's currently classified as
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
compensation overbased and the other
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
workers comp bill that you'll be
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
entertaining later is suggesting that it
 
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
be counted as base and not compensation
 
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
over base which can have some effect on
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
benefits but that's a different Bill
 
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.110 align:start position:0%
benefits but that's a different Bill
representative

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
citech but that as earnable compensation
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really mean anything to to
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
their pension because you take the high
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
highest five years and something like a
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah it depends on how long you've
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
been on disability and collecting it
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
average compensation is calculated in 12
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
month tranches so if you make enough
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
money in the rest the rest of the year
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
when you're not injured it may still be
 
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
one of your high three or high five
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
years but it's guess work on the math um
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
and I have a question for you as you
 
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
were looking for the information did you
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
look to your records to see how many
 
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
people did have um time off that did not
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
get counted towards the um serviceable
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
credit uh no we our records only show
 
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
what credit we've awarded to people for
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
that first year they they have to
 
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
provide us a memo of compensability and
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
and then they're showing the start date
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
and the end date
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
and we would record that and our
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
assistant the service credit awarded but
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
we don't record what wasn't awarded or
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
or it just wasn't something we kept
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
track of okay thank you it's helpful to
 
00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
know that D those data don't exist um
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
and then the last question are you do
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know whether people are more
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
incentivized to go for the service
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
related Disability Pension um if they're
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
going to be out more than a year so that
 
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
they don't lose that
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
coverage I I couldn't speak to people's
 
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.909 align:start position:0%
coverage I I couldn't speak to people's
personal

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
motivations thank you there other
 
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
questions see n thank you very much and

00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
do that if you get the pink card to him
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
you is there anybody else here to speak
 
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.630 align:start position:0%

this with this we will close that
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
hearing is should we consider going into
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
an executive session to discuss this so
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%

216 you want me to slide over it's
 
00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:19.789 align:start position:0%
216 you want me to slide over it's

00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
easiest representative Lon you're name
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%

thank you very
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
motion I'll move a to pass on House Bill
 
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
216 all right and I'll second
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
it all right representative groer thank
 
00:24:55.149 --> 00:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
you Madame chair I just um first of all
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
want to remind the committee that we're
 
00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
voting on policy
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
and that the fiscal the uh Finance um
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
division will determine whether or not
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
this is something we can put into our
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
budget or not and so the policy that we
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
are voting on is
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
that um if a work someone who who has
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
experienced an accident and
 
00:25:23.159 --> 00:25:25.149 align:start position:0%
experienced an accident and
is

00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
um out of work for a year or more that
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
that time is not is not um deducted from
 
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.389 align:start position:0%
that time is not is not um deducted from
their

00:25:37.389 --> 00:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
pension and that's really what we're
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
saying we're saying that if someone's
 
00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:42.919 align:start position:0%
injured in the case of the the person
 
00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
that testified last year they had been
 
00:25:45.399 --> 00:25:46.750 align:start position:0%
that testified last year they had been
injured

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
injured
 
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
for they were in the hospital I think
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
the first for 14 months to have their
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
first surgery and then to have their
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
second surgery a year later they were
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
out of again for a long period of time
 
00:25:59.950 --> 00:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
and when they thought they were could
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
retire they were really trying to stay
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
in the workforce until for 10 years but
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
then when they and not realizing that
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
their Workman time their workman's
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
compensation time was deducted from
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
their um work from their pension work
 
00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
time they ended up working eight years
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
so they were it was they were penalized
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
for that and I think that when someone
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
is Gravely injured like that they
 
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have that penalty so I hope
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
that you will agree that as a policy
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
bill and thank you represent fra I'll
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
mention that as I said I think the idea
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
that 10% of the population is going to
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
be out for more than a year is highly
 
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
exaggerated and
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
U I would say it's if it's 1% I'd be
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
surprised the U last year year when we
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
were talking about firefight uh police
 
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
who had been injured on the job and
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
severely injured and had to retire on
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
disability because of it because they
 
00:27:09.399 --> 00:27:10.430 align:start position:0%
disability because of it because they
didn't

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.230 align:start position:0%
didn't
die

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
die
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
um after much searching they could only
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
Identify two people that it had happened
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
to and I think that's a much more
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
realistic number than 10% of the
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
population um so we'll see what the
 
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
um what comes out of it but I we're
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
trying to find out how many people are
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
are there are would be affected by this
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
and I think um as representative groa
 
00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
said I think we owe it to the people
 
00:27:42.279 --> 00:27:43.750 align:start position:0%
said I think we owe it to the people
that

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
are severely injured on the job to at
 
00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:49.519 align:start position:0%
least recognize
 
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
it presid citech just a minute if we're
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
not going to be fair on this issue what
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
issue are we going to be fair on
 
00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
well probably
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
not any other representativ L uh thank
 
00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:06.919 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh my question is if um
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
the conditions around workman's
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
compensation are something that's
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
handled with the legislature or if
 
00:28:15.149 --> 00:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
that's set through other policy uh it's
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
it's set through other policy workers
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
comp issues are done mostly in the labor
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
committee and I have they're the experts
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
on what's job related and what's what's
 
00:28:30.509 --> 00:28:30.519 align:start position:0%
not and how long somebody should be out
 
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:33.559 align:start position:0%
for a particular injury uh they're they
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
do this all the time that's their entire
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
job so this bill doesn't say anything
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
about that you know it just talks about
 
00:28:44.909 --> 00:28:44.919 align:start position:0%
the result of having of being out on
 
00:28:44.919 --> 00:28:49.190 align:start position:0%
the result of having of being out on
workers

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
comp okay any other comments questions
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
yes we're lay on uh thank you um that
 
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
makes me feel a lot more comfortable
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
with this because if we had epidemic of
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
long workers compensations for hang
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
nails um that would be a problem but if
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
we're setting the policy elsewhere in
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature then I feel comfortable
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
that we will only have people out who
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
truly should be out and that that makes
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
me feel a lot more comfortable than if
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
some other body was making those
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
decisions thank you it's it's workers
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
comp is well established policy we've
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
had it
 
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.909 align:start position:0%
had it
for

00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%

85 second second by representative
 
00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
Schmid and to recap this
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
is a bill to allow a student respiratory
 
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
therapist to
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
work with what they've already learned
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
in their I believe it's a two-year
 
00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:47.559 align:start position:0%
course so a seconde student can be
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
employed with what they learned in the
 
00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
first year
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
um under supervision and only what they
 
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.710 align:start position:0%
um under supervision and only what they
have

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:55.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
um have learned which
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
is it's supported by the hospital

first do you wish to speak to your
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
motion uh no all right Schmidt do you
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your second I do so so
 
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that we had last year
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
that the uh the committee unanimously
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
approved um and it got hung up uh
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
because it was Ved what it was Ved well
 
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
that was a hangup because uh the
 
00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
lobbyist of the Kyo
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
prors uh pointed out that there was a
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
defect in the bill the concept was fine
 
00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
but Bill had a problem and and the the
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
chiropractors uh opposed it for that
 
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
reason um and and the lobbyist spoke
 
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
with the governor and the governor
 
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
vetoed it but now that defect has been
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
corrected it's back before us again with
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill was recognized by
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
the committee is a is a necessary idea
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
because especially the fact that people
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
were having problems and they needed to
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
have the chiropractor work on their
 
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
animal uh and the problem was that
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
getting the referral from the
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
chiropractors was very un uh sorry from
 
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.990 align:start position:0%
chiropractors was very un uh sorry from
the

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
veterinarians uh was very difficult in
 
00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
many cases and involved a considerable
 
00:37:27.069 --> 00:37:27.079 align:start position:0%
delay so here's the client with a an
 
00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
animal has a problem that the
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
chiropractor can fix but the referral is
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
hanging them up for weeks or months at
 
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
the time uh and that was not viable so
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's the reason that uh that this bill
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
came about representative Kelly who was
 
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
the sponsor uh you know presented the
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
case to us last year everybody
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
recognized that this was uh not an
 
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.109 align:start position:0%
recognized that this was uh not an
acceptable

00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
situation but the defect caused the
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
government Governor to veto it now I've
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
spoken with a lobbyist who says it's
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
been corrected and we have a new
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
governor as well so now we're going to
 
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
go at it again and try and correct the
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
situation with this improved and and
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
corrected bill so thank you very much
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
right does anyone else have a comment
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%

building code review board through
 
00:49:45.119 --> 00:49:46.270 align:start position:0%
building code review board through
September

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
September
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
13th the only amendment that I am
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
positive of that was approved between
 
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
the previous ratification date which I
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
May and September is the adoption of
 
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.510 align:start position:0%
May and September is the adoption of
the

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh leak test limit that we passed last
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
approve other
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
ECB good morning Madam chair and
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is stepen rank
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
cour I'm a licensed electrician of State
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire um I represent the
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
electrical contractors Business
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
Association and we're here in favor of
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
this um this bill it's updating our code
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
is something that's done every three
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
years and it went through the process
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
with the state building code to adopt
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
any amendments that they felt were
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
needed to it they had a subcommittee
 
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
that went through worked over for over a
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
year and um we worked together with them
 
00:51:04.789 --> 00:51:04.799 align:start position:0%
and I think it's uh got all all things
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
are important to the state and it should
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
bring us up to the most recent code so I
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
also want to just take a minute to thank
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the uh State Building
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
Code of View Board Phil shman he's done
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of work to coordinate these things
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
for all the Amendments and and really
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
make this process much better along with
 
00:51:22.109 --> 00:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
represent of Maguire so that we're not
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
here in front of you arguing about
 
00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
amendments we just come to you with a
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
nice bill that hopefully works so
 
00:51:29.549 --> 00:51:29.559 align:start position:0%
I appreciate if you would vote for it to
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
move forward and answer any questions
 
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
committee seeing n thank you very
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
much and next I'll call Philip Sherman
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Madam chair members of
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
the committee it's good to see some old
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
friends and some new friends here uh
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the invitation today
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire uh thought it
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
might be helpful to provide just a
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
little bit of context as to where this
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
fits into our overall process for some
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
of the new members uh but my name is
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
Philip Sherman I'm the chair of the of
 
00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:20.839 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire building code review
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
board uh and for the record I speak in
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill so the New Hampshire
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
state building code consists of eight uh
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
so-called model codes published by
 
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.589 align:start position:0%
so-called model codes published by
volunteer

00:52:32.589 --> 00:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
organizations uh seven of which are
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
published by the International Code
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
Council the eighth being the electrical
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
code which is published by the National
 
00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
Fire Protection Association those model
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
codes come out on a three-year cycle so
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the 2023 code we're
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
coming off of the 2020 model code um
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
we're not exactly synced with that cycle
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
yet but after this this round we hope to
 
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
become synced where every three years we
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
update the code which will lag one
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
published Edition behind the model codes
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
as required by Statute um so that's the
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
general context that's why you're only
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
seeing the electrical code now is their
 
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
publication date rides a year behind the
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
International Code Council seven other
 
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
codes the building code the residential
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
code and so forth so we'll be back with
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
with the next iteration of those codes
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
on the next round so uh on October 16th
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
of last year we forwarded recommended
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
legislation is required by Statute to
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee on State Building
 
00:53:43.069 --> 00:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
and fire codes which ultimately resulted
 
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
in this legislation in summary the
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
building uh the bill would would adopt
 
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
the 2023 edition of the national
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
electorate code there are 19 New
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire amendments and two additional
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
amendments to the International energy
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
conservation code that this bill would
 
00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:03.799 align:start position:0%
ratify the board approved a report on
 
00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:07.799 align:start position:0%
the 2023 NEC which has been provided uh
 
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
to identify the relative cost impact of
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
significant changes between the 2020
 
00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
Edition and the 2023 Edition and I want
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
to pass Steve's thanks only through me
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
to the four electrical Representatives
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
on our board who really really really
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
know where every comma and period is in
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
that code and they did the heavy lifting
 
00:54:32.829 --> 00:54:32.839 align:start position:0%
on getting us through to this point a
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
public hearing was held on the updated
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
code in the Amendments after which our
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
board voted unanimously to recommend
 
00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:39.870 align:start position:0%
board voted unanimously to recommend
this

00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
legislation most of the amendments are
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
we call them carry forward amendments so
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
they just ride from addition to addition
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
although they're reviewed each time
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
because the same the same issues come up
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
in each addition of the code there are
 
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
three new amendments each each of which
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
save cost and five previous amendments
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
were dropped as they were no longer no
 
00:55:04.349 --> 00:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
longer needed sometimes our amendments
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
work their way into the code sometimes
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
sections are combined and one Amendment
 
00:55:11.789 --> 00:55:11.799 align:start position:0%
becomes two or vice versa
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
likewise um after we submitted the
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
recommended legislation the doj
 
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
clarified that the amendment to the 2018
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
ICC on building air testing as required
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
by uh Senate bills 373 last last of the
 
00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:30.039 align:start position:0%
last session was effectively already
 
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
ratified by the legislature so in fact
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
it didn't need to be in this process uh
 
00:55:38.589 --> 00:55:38.599 align:start position:0%
you ratified it or or the general court
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
ratified it when they adopted that bill
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh but the amendment is there the other
 
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the iecc simply takes the
 
00:55:49.789 --> 00:55:49.799 align:start position:0%
longstanding energy code submitt form
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
and makes it an amendment rather than a
 
00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
rule and the reason for that is it needs
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
to stay in sync with the updated code so
 
00:55:58.750 --> 00:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
it comes out at the same time the codes
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
do no real changes to the form it was
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
just a matter of how we adopt that form
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
Again by Statute um so that's all I have
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
to say I thank uh you for your time and
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions you
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
committee members seeing none thank
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
you is there anybody else who is here to
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
134 seeing none um with that I will
 
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
134 so not did we want to go into an
 
00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:42.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
likely perfect then I will move over we
 
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
okay we'll start an executive session on
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
134 and I'll move on to pass I'll second
 
00:57:26.589 --> 00:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
Howard moves on second
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you I have nothing to add
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative Howard uh I think that
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty Common Sense uh change
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
to the building code thank you all right
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
concerns okay not seeing any the motion
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass and the clerk can call
 
00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.309 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass and the clerk can call
the

00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
role Vice chair uh Vice chairman Lon

hello I would like to open the hearing
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 428 and invite the prime
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
speak good morning um house committee
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
executive departments administrations
 
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
it's refreshing to see a committee
 
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
running on time right now I think a lot
 
01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
of them are behind including mine so
 
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
congratulations thank you for that um
 
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is representative
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
Joe Alexander I'm serving my fourth term
 
01:31:58.830 --> 01:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
I represent the town of gtown um I also
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
sit as chairman of the housing committee
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
um as well as on Judiciary um I am here
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
to present what I believe is a pretty
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill that does exactly
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
what it says in the title it streamlines
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
State Building Code by making it
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
consistent across all of our
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities currently under state law
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities are able to make
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
amendments to the state code that are
 
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
more stringent this causes the
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
possibility of hundreds of different
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
codes across the state can you see where
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
that's an issue um this bill would make
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
the following codes consistent across
 
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
all municipalities um I'm going to read
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
just four of them but there's like nine
 
01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
of them on this list the international
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
building code 2021 International
 
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
residential code of 2021 the electrical
 
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
code and all amendments that have been
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the state building go review
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
board as of May 20 May 10th 2024 and
 
01:32:51.510 --> 01:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
ratified by this body um last year so um
 
01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
mainly I propose this because I mean
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
government aot in um in her inaugural
 
01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
address indicated that housing is one of
 
01:32:59.470 --> 01:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
the most important issues facing New
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but in general this bill would
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
would take a step in the right direction
 
01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
by establishing one state code this will
 
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
enable businesses residential
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
developments and Industrial developments
 
01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:11.719 align:start position:0%
have one code so you don't have to hire
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
consultants for each Town you're
 
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
building in or to figure out what their
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
amendments to the code are um I mean
 
01:33:19.229 --> 01:33:19.239 align:start position:0%
there's some ridiculous like local codes
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
that have occurred um you know so this
 
01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
consistency will provide better outcomes
 
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
by making the process less painful um
 
01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
for those who wish in businesses and
 
01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
Residences that wish to invest in our
 
01:33:35.229 --> 01:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
state so um I will say that um SB 437
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
passed this body last year
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
2024 um there's currently no Municipal
 
01:33:41.229 --> 01:33:41.239 align:start position:0%
amendments right now to the State
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
Building Code I I believe Phil Sherman
 
01:33:43.870 --> 01:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
is here you can correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
but that's what I we spoke about that in
 
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
the hallway um so this is the perfect
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
time to pass a bill like this because
 
01:33:51.629 --> 01:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
there's really not a lot of Municipal
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
amendments yet existing because this is
 
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
Val the building code was just updated
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
to 2021 building code so um with that
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions there are
 
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
other people here experts that can speak
 
01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
but I I think philosophically it's
 
01:34:07.629 --> 01:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
incredibly important that we streamline
 
01:34:09.629 --> 01:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of these make government more
 
01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
efficient um you know there's nothing
 
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
wrong with the state code AS is the
 
01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
legislature Dives deep into it um the
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
building code review board has um
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
multiple experts on the board that
 
01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
evaluate the merits of um certain
 
01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
policies and certain codes so I think I
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
have confidence that this legislative
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
branch can can handle um safety aspects
 
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
and make sure that you know citizens are
 
01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
safe and secure um but while also making
 
01:34:34.990 --> 01:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
it easy for people to live in live and
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
renovate their property the way they see
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
fit so um with that I'm happy to answer
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you other uh okay
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative long uh do you have
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
examples of those local amendments to
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
building codes that were uh extreme or
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
inappropriate in your opinion um there's
 
01:34:54.030 --> 01:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
some that I philosop thank you for the
 
01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
question representative I mean there's
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
some that I philosophically believe with
 
01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
I think um you know more stringent local
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
energy codes I think would be a good
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
example of that you know um for instance
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
a town that would require um a a
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
different type of window for Energy
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
Efficiency or things like that I think
 
01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:12.679 align:start position:0%
um adds more of a layer than what's
 
01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
currently needed and I think based on
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
the philosophical makeup of a town they
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
may you know have a more stringent
 
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
energy code to you know combat climate
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
change or something like that so I just
 
01:35:27.310 --> 01:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
want to make sure it's consistent across
 
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
you know the entire
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
state representative groda thank you um
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative Alexandria I just want to
 
01:35:36.669 --> 01:35:36.679 align:start position:0%
make it clear that this wouldn't prevent
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
individuals who wanted to have an
 
01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
updated version of anything that was in
 
01:35:46.590 --> 01:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
the um more recent codes that are not
 
01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:49.159 align:start position:0%
adopted by the state able to do so
 
01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's a great question um this
 
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
is the this is the floor right like you
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
know if you want to build the most
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
energy efficient property um you know to
 
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
to to reduce your energy costs like you
 
01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
are more than welcome to do that um the
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
state building code is the code it's the
 
01:36:07.629 --> 01:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
it's the floor um that's required to to
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
build up to and then anything additional
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
you're still allowed to to build on so
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
it it maintains private property rights
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Alexander um
 
01:36:18.109 --> 01:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
does this also go to affordability
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
because if somebody is being forced to
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
adopt say windows that aren't commonly
 
01:36:24.750 --> 01:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
used in the state would that be a more
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
expensive component that leads to access
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
to housing oh absolutely huge and and
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
you know I've spoken to the home
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
builders who um are in support of this
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that say basically like you
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
know having to hire consultants for each
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
project depending on what town you live
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
in is an onerous thing so that increased
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
cost there but not on top of that you
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
have like you know if there are more
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
requirements more often than not they're
 
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
more expensive but you know they could
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
be less expensive but um for my
 
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
experience they' be more so that's a
 
01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
great question and I wholeheartedly
 
01:36:58.270 --> 01:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
agree thank you representative
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
ree hi um my question has to do with
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
local conditions so I live in Hampton
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
and I believe if I'm not mistaken that
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
our town actually requires an extra foot
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
of freeboard would this this bill
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
prevent us and in fact roll back that
 
01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
requirement if I'm correct um so thank
 
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
you for your question representative it
 
01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
would prevent it I do not believe it
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
would roll back because the way the code
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
is written now it's the it is the
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
building code there haven't been
 
01:37:28.239 --> 01:37:29.310 align:start position:0%
building code there haven't been
Municipal

01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
amendments to that code recently I I'll
 
01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
let Phil Phil Sherman clarify that but
 
01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:36.159 align:start position:0%
um yes this bill would prevent something
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
like that thank you you're
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
welcome seeing no further questions
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh next I'll call call
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
Margaret Burns to speak from the New
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Margaret Burns
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
Association we are here this morning in
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 428 House Bill
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
428 would take away established local
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
authority to adopt local codes which has
 
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
been established in state law for many
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
years additionally this bill comes on
 
01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
the heels of legislation that was passed
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
just last year that would have made
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
pretty serious changes that did make
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
pretty serious changes to the way in
 
01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
which local building codes are
 
01:38:30.109 --> 01:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
enforcable so just last year this
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
legislature through I believe Senate
 
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 437 passed some substantial changes
 
01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
that required in part uh municipalities
 
01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
send their local building code
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
amendments to the State Building Code
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
review board and in order if they didn't
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
do that the codes would become
 
01:38:48.910 --> 01:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
unenforceable so we've just recently had
 
01:38:51.149 --> 01:38:51.159 align:start position:0%
a quite substantial change in the way
 
01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
that these codes become enforcable after
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
after adoption and I would ask the
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
committee to consider letting the
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
legislation from last year play out
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
before we go ahead and remove entirely
 
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
local authority to adopt local building
 
01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
codes I would also note that I know
 
01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear this morning from
 
01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
Phil Sherman I believe you're also going
 
01:39:12.189 --> 01:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
to hear this morning from a
 
01:39:13.589 --> 01:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
representative from the New Hampshire
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
building um building officials
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
Association if this bill is going to
 
01:39:21.070 --> 01:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
move forward those two stakeholders do
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
have suggestions about amendments that
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
would be need to make the bill workable
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
and I would urge the committee to also
 
01:39:28.990 --> 01:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
listen to those suggestions to make the
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
bill workable if the bill will be moving
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
forward thank you so much for your time
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you question uh representative
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
long so I'm not really familiar with the
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
process of how uh municipalities make
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
amendments to the building code uh when
 
01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
that's done is that something that's
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
voted on by the voters or is it done by
 
01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
the politicians in the town great
 
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
question so they are voted on by the
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
local legislative body and in the
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
majority of our municipalities the local
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
legislative body is in fact the town
 
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
meeting so it is the voters just like
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
they would also be the ones to adopt
 
01:40:07.229 --> 01:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
local zoning amendments in the
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities where the legislative
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
body is the city council the couple of
 
01:40:13.149 --> 01:40:13.159 align:start position:0%
towns where the legislative body is the
 
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
Town Council and the two cities where
 
01:40:17.629 --> 01:40:17.639 align:start position:0%
the legislative body is the board of
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
alderman they would be the body to adopt
 
01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
those codes locally
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:27.639 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much next
 
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
Sherman Madame chair members of the
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Philip Sherman and
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
I speak as the chair of the building
 
01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
code review board uh and I'm in favor of
 
01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
this bill only if amended uh the
 
01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
building code review board itself does
 
01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.159 align:start position:0%
not take a position on this bill at this
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
time only due to our meeting sequence
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
and not having had the language at our
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
last meeting uh but it propos the bill
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
proposes to eliminate the current
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
authorization from municipalities to
 
01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
amend the State Building Code I think I
 
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
heard a question about adopting later
 
01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
additions of the model codes that are
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
within the State Building Code that was
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
prohibited by legislation last year
 
01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
um we do find however that if this bill
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
moov moves forward it's important to
 
01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
allow for certain administrative
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
amendments related to statutory
 
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
Authority and to allow for the various
 
01:41:34.350 --> 01:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
ways that the code is implemented in the
 
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
various municipalities large cities
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
operate differently than small
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
towns um we also believe that for the
 
01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
issues involved this is a good time to
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
move some of the building code related
 
01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
sections now in the land use and City
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
Grant of power chapters into
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
155a which is what the the proposed Bill
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
HP 244 is trying to do this afternoon
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
anyway um so this corrects some
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
conflicting terminology and allows us to
 
01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:05.719 align:start position:0%
fix a cross reference error with the
 
01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
current statutes and so forth um it also
 
01:42:12.510 --> 01:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
would maintain through an amendment this
 
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
is the current uh building code
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment confirmation process for the
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
now permitted administrative amendments
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
just to make sure they stay on track
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
so while we have a significant Amendment
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
sort of uh drafted out it's not ready
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
for prime time yet there's some loose
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
ends that need to be resolved the State
 
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshall has some concerns with how
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's written drafted at this point and
 
01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
that's why we're not prepared to submit
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
it today and we would therefore submit
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
moving this to a subcommittee for a
 
01:42:45.589 --> 01:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
quick turnaround and I thank you for
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
your consideration happy to answer any
 
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are questions from
 
01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
Schmidt I thank thank mam chair good
 
01:42:57.390 --> 01:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
morning Phil uh so did I understand you
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
correctly to say you support 428 local
 
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
only if
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
amended my support will be limited to my
 
01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
personal view not the board's view but
 
01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
uh I can safely say that the board would
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
agree that if it moves forward uh it
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
needs amendments or we're going to have
 
01:43:18.189 --> 01:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
a real mess in terms of how things are
 
01:43:22.109 --> 01:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
enforced out in the field thank you very
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
much any other questions from the
 
01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh next I'll call I
 
01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
believe this is Philip jazik I apologize
 
01:43:36.629 --> 01:43:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
that good afternoon Madam chair uh my
 
01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
name is Philip jzac I'm the
 
01:43:42.030 --> 01:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
communications director for the New
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Home Builders Association um
 
01:43:46.990 --> 01:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
we are very much in favor of this bill
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
um the biggest one of the things that we
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
hear a lot from our Builders especially
 
01:43:52.830 --> 01:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
our smaller Builders one two three man
 
01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:53.750 align:start position:0%
our smaller Builders one two three man
shop

01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
shop
 
01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
is that it's very difficult for them to
 
01:43:58.189 --> 01:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
navigate the changes across
 
01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities and this would allow them
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
that consistency and simplicity to go
 
01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
forward uh or excuse me going
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
forward and the uh the consistency as
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
well as mentioned by representative
 
01:44:13.950 --> 01:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
Alexander would allow allow our Builders
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
to keep cost down and make housing more
 
01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
attainable for our consumers um it's
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
also important to know I believe it was
 
01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
asked and answered but this would not
 
01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
prevent anybody from doing anything we
 
01:44:27.510 --> 01:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
just at the New Hampshire Home Builders
 
01:44:29.470 --> 01:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
we want our consumers to decide what
 
01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
they want for a house not be forced into
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
anything you questions from the
 
01:44:37.629 --> 01:44:37.639 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
scitec Mr jasc you heard uh Mr Sherman
 
01:44:44.109 --> 01:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about the tone of his
 
01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
amendments so I uh I have not
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
investigated that personally I would
 
01:44:52.350 --> 01:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
have to go back to uh go back and and
 
01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
look into that
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
I I'm not going to give you a guess
 
01:44:56.669 --> 01:44:56.679 align:start position:0%
right now I would like to give you a
 
01:44:56.679 --> 01:44:58.109 align:start position:0%
right now I would like to give you a
concrete

01:44:58.109 --> 01:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
concrete
 
01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
answer followup if there is a
 
01:45:01.950 --> 01:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will somebody from the uh
 
01:45:04.990 --> 01:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
building contractors be there we would
 
01:45:06.669 --> 01:45:06.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely like to be there if you if we
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
are asked to be there we will be there
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative Dev thank you do you have
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
examples of specific towns that have
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
higher standards now and how it is
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
impacting affordable housing or
 
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
access yes so in currently all I have
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
right now is is information and stories
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
and um anecdotal evidence from my
 
01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
Builders um I did go in and try to
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
research this on my own the the towns in
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
which I did research it was very
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
difficult to find specific amendments
 
01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
that were made to the code um as they
 
01:45:45.589 --> 01:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
were not available online um so I would
 
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
have to do more research on that to give
 
01:45:49.950 --> 01:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
you a comprehensive list thank you thank
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Madam chair so uh CH
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
question of the chair first is it going
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
to subcommittee the bill yes it will it
 
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
will be thank you uh now my question for
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
this gentleman so um you're new to me
 
01:46:07.589 --> 01:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
could you spell your last name for me
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:14.709 align:start position:0%
 
A

01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
A
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you and um I have a
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
question for you as well when you look
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
at different Regional and Geographic
 
01:46:24.510 --> 01:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
differences are Builders looking at
 
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
things like a Sea Coast climate and
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
already making adaptations that are
 
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate to that environment like
 
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
potentially the freeboard whether or not
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's in code yes so the the state
 
01:46:36.910 --> 01:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
building code is based off of the iecc
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
international code which takes into
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
account all the different climate zones
 
01:46:43.390 --> 01:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
on the entire planet so um the vast
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
majority of instances we would run into
 
01:46:47.950 --> 01:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
in this stay already covered by the code
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative scitec you you
 
01:46:53.310 --> 01:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
said something that uh
 
01:46:55.390 --> 01:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
that's really not part of this but I'd
 
01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
like to hear people for building
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
contractors or speak to this issue you
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't find things online how
 
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
transparent are building codes town to
 
01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
toown uh that's tough for me to answer
 
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities thank you uh
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
representative log uh just a followup to
 
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
that question are the building codes the
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
municipal amendments to it required to
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
be available in writing in some
 
01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
apologize any other questions from the
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
01:47:41.950 --> 01:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
much you and next I'll call natch Grace
 
01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:45.229 align:start position:0%
much you and next I'll call natch Grace
from

01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
Bia thank you n Grace the business and
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
industry Association uh we are the
 
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
state's uh Statewide Chamber of Commerce
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh we support this legislation U before
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
anyone asks me uh we would be supportive
 
01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
of any friendly amendments to uh make
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
sure that everything works uh and is and
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
is uh works well uh I think as Mr
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
Sherman alluded to uh within the
 
01:48:12.589 --> 01:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
statutes there has been
 
01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
historically a mixing of things between
 
01:48:17.589 --> 01:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
the building code and the zoning the
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
zoning statutes um so legislation you'll
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
hear later today would attempt to
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
separate out those um but one of the
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
problems with the the mixing is
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
obviously you have different authorities
 
01:48:30.589 --> 01:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
trying to do different things um so some
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
clarity may be uh necessary I've not yet
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
seen his Amendment um but I'm happy to
 
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
work with that uh work with him or
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
anyone on any such
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
amendments um just to not belabor any
 
01:48:44.350 --> 01:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
points but to give you a little bit of
 
01:48:46.350 --> 01:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
History here uh the Statewide building
 
01:48:49.629 --> 01:48:49.639 align:start position:0%
code was initially adopted uh in the
 
01:48:49.639 --> 01:48:50.669 align:start position:0%
code was initially adopted uh in the
early

01:48:50.669 --> 01:48:50.679 align:start position:0%
early
 
01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
2000s in response uh to the fact that we
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
are a small state and having 234
 
01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
different building codes uh made it very
 
01:49:01.709 --> 01:49:01.719 align:start position:0%
difficult for developers to know on a
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
Town Bytown basis um where they would
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
what they would have to build to as a
 
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
standard now I want to be clear that the
 
01:49:10.830 --> 01:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
building code is not about what can be
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
built in a certain location but how it's
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
built um so it's not about whether or
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
not this is a house or gas station uh or
 
01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
anything else it's about okay if this is
 
01:49:24.430 --> 01:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
is going to be a house how are you going
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
to build this um realistically uh
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
looking at the climate zones in New
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that Mr JC uh referenced at
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
the international building code level
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
there aren't too many differences um
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
there are some obviously with the SE
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
Coast some uh obviously in the South
 
01:49:42.669 --> 01:49:42.679 align:start position:0%
versus Coos County you're seeing some
 
01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
differences in terms of what's what's
 
01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
required but uh not not significant and
 
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
that's mainly because we are a small
 
01:49:54.270 --> 01:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
state um over time the building code
 
01:49:56.030 --> 01:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
after initial adoption in the early
 
01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
2000s was adopted periodically updated
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
periodically by the state
 
01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
legislature um back in I believe it was
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
about 2017 to 2019 the legislature
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
started uh the process of of creating a
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
very clear process where now every three
 
01:50:17.669 --> 01:50:17.679 align:start position:0%
years essentially the state um the State
 
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
Building officials they come forward uh
 
01:50:22.750 --> 01:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
with an update uh representative McGuire
 
01:50:24.750 --> 01:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
has been the prime sponsor of that
 
01:50:27.390 --> 01:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
update uh for the past several sessions
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
um so they look at the updated uh
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
International building codes which come
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
out every 3 years make suggestions to
 
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
tailor those to New Hampshire propose
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
those to the legislature and then if all
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
goes smoothly those go through with some
 
01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
changes um so we have a very clear
 
01:50:47.229 --> 01:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
process now um and so what that does is
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
it updates the codes across the state uh
 
01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
every three years so some of that prior
 
01:50:58.069 --> 01:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
legislation that was referenced um they
 
01:51:00.510 --> 01:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
it did update both definitions as well
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
as codes so one of the problems that
 
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
would be addressed uh kind of
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
additionally by a one state one code
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
model is that a number of municipalities
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
over time adopted amendments that are
 
01:51:17.870 --> 01:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
now out of date um technically because
 
01:51:19.470 --> 01:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
definitions have been updated they
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
should go through the update process and
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
under existing law they would have to
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
provide that to the State Building Code
 
01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh review board um and I believe some
 
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
have provided or attempted to provided
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
updates but none of those have been
 
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
approved yet and therefore not in effect
 
01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
but it may be the case that at the local
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
levels was referenced by representative
 
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
rise some municipalities are attempting
 
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
to enforce updates that are not yet
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
actually in effect because they haven't
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
gone through that uh existing
 
01:51:52.189 --> 01:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
legislative process um but it may be the
 
01:51:54.189 --> 01:51:54.199 align:start position:0%
case at one point in time they did have
 
01:51:58.069 --> 01:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
those as mandates um I don't have any
 
01:52:01.470 --> 01:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
good examples for you of um those
 
01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:03.159 align:start position:0%
changes that would be significantly
 
01:52:05.709 --> 01:52:05.719 align:start position:0%
affected uh the one that I know of that
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
comes to mind is naswa has a very
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
specific uh spr
 
01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
um happy to take any questions the
 
01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
committee may have any questions from
 
01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:15.990 align:start position:0%
committee may have any questions from
the

01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative Schmidt thank
 
01:52:21.550 --> 01:52:21.560 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so you've heard that
 
01:52:24.189 --> 01:52:24.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a sub committee um
 
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
there's several questions been raised by
 
01:52:28.669 --> 01:52:28.679 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh that clearly need to
 
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
be further investigated and and fleshed
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
out and so forth so you intend to
 
01:52:37.149 --> 01:52:37.159 align:start position:0%
participate because we I think we need
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
your input if I'm available I'd be happy
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
to participate very good thank
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony and I would like
 
01:52:59.709 --> 01:52:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chair members of the
 
01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:02.830 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chair members of the
committee

01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:53:06.189 --> 01:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just res just responding to the
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
questions about local amendments the
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
situation is that last year we
 
01:53:15.109 --> 01:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
completely changed the process we also
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
updated this overall State Building Code
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
from the 21 ver to to the uh 19
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
2021 version all over so any
 
01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
existing um local amendments that
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
applied to the previous version were
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
automatically invalidated by that
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
process some of them were carried for
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
would be able to be carried forward and
 
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
I believe at least one municipality has
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
done so they had a specific one it they
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
they brought it to the building code
 
01:53:53.709 --> 01:53:53.719 align:start position:0%
review board and it was approved
 
01:53:57.229 --> 01:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
um and I would confirm that the a large
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
problem we have had in the past is that
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
Municipal amendments were not formally
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
adopted they were sometimes informally
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
adopted or informally enforced by the
 
01:54:13.470 --> 01:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
building inspectors which is very
 
01:54:17.069 --> 01:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
difficult to keep uniform and
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
fair so
 
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
um that's why we updated the process to
 
01:54:26.350 --> 01:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
require amendments to be formally
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
approved by the town so that if a town
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
does want something specific they can
 
01:54:36.750 --> 01:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
approve it and and have that would also
 
01:54:39.790 --> 01:54:39.800 align:start position:0%
require that all local amendments are
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
posted on the State Building Code Review
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
Board website so that people can know
 
01:54:50.069 --> 01:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
what's going on that in the past knowing
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
what communities had which amend M ments
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
if any was extremely difficult so the
 
01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
current process as of six months ago is
 
01:55:03.310 --> 01:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
towns suggested a change approve them by
 
01:55:09.189 --> 01:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
their legislative body and submit them
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
to the State Building Code review board
 
01:55:14.830 --> 01:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they are compatible with
 
01:55:19.069 --> 01:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
the state building code and the
 
01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
municipal Authority which in most cases
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
means is more stringent than the basic
 
01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:27.320 align:start position:0%
State Building Code
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh M Mr Sherman can tell you more
 
01:55:32.910 --> 01:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
accurately than I can how many
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities are in the process of
 
01:55:36.990 --> 01:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
approving them but I did hear that at
 
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
least one town did submit an amendment
 
01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:41.589 align:start position:0%
least one town did submit an amendment
properly

01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
properly
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
authorized and it has been approved so
 
01:55:48.669 --> 01:55:48.679 align:start position:0%
uh it is a very new process so people
 
01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
always um familiar with it
 
01:55:55.870 --> 01:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
I did work a bit with the municipal
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
Association to help train towns and
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
building inspectors about the new
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
process because it is different than
 
01:56:10.109 --> 01:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
what it had been but um so it is a
 
01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
change not everybody's up to it but the
 
01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
intent is to make building code
 
01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
amendments be more transparent and more
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
available and hopefully more uniform
 
01:56:26.430 --> 01:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
across the state oh thank you
 
01:56:29.629 --> 01:56:29.639 align:start position:0%
representative log uh on the subject of
 
01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
building inspectors sort of doing their
 
01:56:35.229 --> 01:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
own thing how much ambiguity is there in
 
01:56:37.870 --> 01:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
the State Building Code that would allow
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
someone to sort of make up their own
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
interpretation of it I am not an expert
 
01:56:46.030 --> 01:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
but I've read portions of the building
 
01:56:49.109 --> 01:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
code in many cases there are two
 
01:56:50.589 --> 01:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
different op two or three different
 
01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
options of acceptable ways to do do
 
01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
something it is I've heard cases where
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
the building inspector
 
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
said do it this way there are
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
also um verbal instructions that are not
 
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
incompatible with the building code but
 
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
they're uh
 
01:57:11.470 --> 01:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
different and I have also anecdotally
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
heard of building inspectors saying well
 
01:57:16.589 --> 01:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
that's how we do it here without any
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.990 --> 01:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
change and I I will reiterate that
 
01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
the the Builder or the owner is
 
01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
perfectly free to adopt more stringent
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
requirements than the State Building
 
01:57:39.149 --> 01:57:39.159 align:start position:0%
Code uh I built my house in 2008 and n
 
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
and it is much more energy efficient
 
01:57:43.470 --> 01:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
than the building codes at the time
 
01:57:46.270 --> 01:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
required because I was my husband and I
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
were willing to invest the money to do
 
01:57:48.599 --> 01:57:50.109 align:start position:0%
were willing to invest the money to do
so

01:57:50.109 --> 01:57:50.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
um and that was our option
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
and it's it's worked out very well for
 
01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
us the as was stated the state building
 
01:58:02.750 --> 01:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
ceiling representative
 
01:58:08.189 --> 01:58:08.199 align:start position:0%
gr so my understanding um representative
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
Maguire is that
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
this amend this bill would set the floor
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
for the state and if and if
 
01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities wanted to amend the code
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
there's a process for them to do so but
 
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
it sort of gets everybody on the same no
 
01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
no no represent BR this bill would say
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
the town cannot make changes technical
 
01:58:34.709 --> 01:58:34.719 align:start position:0%
changes to the State Building Code Mr
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
Sherman was saying that well you need to
 
01:58:40.069 --> 01:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
have a a better definition of the
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement process which but it's an
 
01:58:46.510 --> 01:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
administrative change not a uh technical
 
01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
change the the current status is the
 
01:58:51.629 --> 01:58:51.639 align:start position:0%
towns can adopt changes to the State
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
Building code this bill would remove
 
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.189 align:start position:0%
Building code this bill would remove
that

01:58:56.189 --> 01:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:59.069 --> 01:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
Authority follow up well thank you but
 
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
in the current the current rule the
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
current law says that they can amend it
 
01:59:07.149 --> 01:59:07.159 align:start position:0%
but it they have to apply to there's an
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
approval process for those so that this
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
bill removes all that yes it removes the
 
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:15.800 align:start position:0%
entire Municipal amendment
 
01:59:19.109 --> 01:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
process and the amendment that is being
 
01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
contemplated is purely for you know how
 
01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:22.550 align:start position:0%
contemplated is purely for you know how
we

01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
implement the inspections that are still
 
01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
required thank you thank you any other
 
01:59:30.510 --> 01:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee saying none
 
01:59:31.870 --> 01:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much is there anybody

uh thank you and welcome back I will

open the hearing on house Bill
 
03:18:51.229 --> 03:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
244 and uh welcome representative
 
03:18:53.550 --> 03:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
Maguire good afternoon Madame chair
 
03:18:56.590 --> 03:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Carol Maguire
 
03:18:59.229 --> 03:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
of marac District
 
03:19:04.389 --> 03:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
27 and House Bill 244 is a request of
 
03:19:06.790 --> 03:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
the building code review
 
03:19:11.830 --> 03:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
board and it is intended to be a
 
03:19:13.950 --> 03:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
recodification and
 
03:19:16.269 --> 03:19:16.279 align:start position:0%
consolidation of the enforcement of the
 
03:19:19.590 --> 03:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
building and fire cats to take it out of
 
03:19:22.429 --> 03:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
the random places it's currently
 
03:19:26.030 --> 03:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
scattered through uh Municipal Authority
 
03:19:28.870 --> 03:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
City Authority planning board authority
 
03:19:30.429 --> 03:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
zoning board of
 
03:19:33.150 --> 03:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
appeals take it out of all those places
 
03:19:35.790 --> 03:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
and consolidate it
 
03:19:40.070 --> 03:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
under uh 155 which is the State Building
 
03:19:44.309 --> 03:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
Code 155a whatever and
 
03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
um it is intended not to have any policy
 
03:19:51.550 --> 03:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
changes but with a bill this size it's
 
03:19:54.150 --> 03:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
always possible that there are some
 
03:19:54.160 --> 03:19:56.550 align:start position:0%
always possible that there are some
inadvertent

03:19:56.550 --> 03:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
inadvertent
 
03:19:56.560 --> 03:19:58.110 align:start position:0%
inadvertent
uh

03:19:58.110 --> 03:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:20:02.070 --> 03:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
misrepresentations or mis references and
 
03:20:05.870 --> 03:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
so um I have planned all along that this
 
03:20:09.189 --> 03:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
go to subcommittee for examination by
 
03:20:11.030 --> 03:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee and any other
 
03:20:13.950 --> 03:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
interested parties U if you have any
 
03:20:15.710 --> 03:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
general questions I'll try to answer
 
03:20:15.720 --> 03:20:18.469 align:start position:0%
general questions I'll try to answer
them

03:20:18.469 --> 03:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:20:19.910 --> 03:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the members
 
03:20:22.750 --> 03:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee representative salers
 
03:20:26.630 --> 03:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um my question is the the
 
03:20:29.110 --> 03:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
idea of this is just to consolidate like
 
03:20:32.309 --> 03:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
you said to the point that everything is
 
03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
in one spot right yes and is it taking
 
03:20:37.150 --> 03:20:37.160 align:start position:0%
the authority away from the
 
03:20:39.710 --> 03:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well no it is not
 
03:20:42.150 --> 03:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
taking away any authority of the
 
03:20:44.990 --> 03:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities to enforce the fire fire
 
03:20:48.269 --> 03:20:48.279 align:start position:0%
or building codes in their
 
03:20:51.590 --> 03:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
municipality should they choose to do so
 
03:20:54.309 --> 03:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
representative Gera thank you um
 
03:20:56.750 --> 03:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire just want confirmation
 
03:20:58.590 --> 03:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
from you that there's no change in
 
03:21:01.910 --> 03:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
policy as a result of these changes it
 
03:21:04.309 --> 03:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
there is no change of policy intended by
 
03:21:06.309 --> 03:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
this bill I cannot guarantee that there
 
03:21:08.590 --> 03:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
isn't one tucked away someplace which is
 
03:21:11.950 --> 03:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:14.229 --> 03:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee any no saying no other
 
03:21:17.429 --> 03:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much um next
 
03:21:29.189 --> 03:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:31.429 --> 03:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
Sherman thank you madam chair members of
 
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
03:21:34.429 --> 03:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
Philip Sherman I speak as the chair of
 
03:21:35.990 --> 03:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
the building code review board and I'm
 
03:21:39.150 --> 03:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill um as confirmed by
 
03:21:40.670 --> 03:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
multiple people involved in the
 
03:21:42.229 --> 03:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the building code there
 
03:21:45.550 --> 03:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
is time extensive at times extensive
 
03:21:47.670 --> 03:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
confusion about how Implement
 
03:21:49.750 --> 03:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
implementation of the building code
 
03:21:52.229 --> 03:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
crosses paths with zoning and other land
 
03:21:55.389 --> 03:21:55.399 align:start position:0%
use statutes much of this confusion
 
03:21:58.030 --> 03:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
comes from sections that continue from a
 
03:22:00.389 --> 03:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
time before the state adopted a
 
03:22:03.070 --> 03:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide code and municipalities own
 
03:22:04.630 --> 03:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
the whole thing if they enforced a
 
03:22:08.349 --> 03:22:08.359 align:start position:0%
building code through 2024 a task force
 
03:22:11.550 --> 03:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
of the bcrb made an attempt to identify
 
03:22:13.389 --> 03:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
the land use sections related to
 
03:22:15.910 --> 03:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
building codes Building Code Enforcement
 
03:22:18.110 --> 03:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
and building code code appeals and find
 
03:22:20.070 --> 03:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
a home for those in
 
03:22:24.510 --> 03:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
155a our intent as was previously stated
 
03:22:26.309 --> 03:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
was that no permissions or no
 
03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
responsibilities would change this would
 
03:22:31.550 --> 03:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
only be an editorial process as you
 
03:22:33.469 --> 03:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
heard this morning we recommend that
 
03:22:34.950 --> 03:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
certain portions of the land use
 
03:22:39.150 --> 03:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
chapters be moved to 155a by HP 428
 
03:22:41.070 --> 03:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with that outside of this
 
03:22:44.429 --> 03:22:44.439 align:start position:0%
room as part of those changes this is a
 
03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
complicated exercise on three front from
 
03:22:49.229 --> 03:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
our perspective first the related
 
03:22:50.950 --> 03:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
sections are splattered throughout the
 
03:22:52.950 --> 03:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
land use sections they've just grown up
 
03:22:55.830 --> 03:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
over time some need to be moved some
 
03:22:57.870 --> 03:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
need to be copied so there are
 
03:22:59.710 --> 03:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
Provisions in there that apply to both
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
zoning and building code we need to
 
03:23:04.349 --> 03:23:04.359 align:start position:0%
leave them in both places second the
 
03:23:06.590 --> 03:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
land use provisions for appeals
 
03:23:09.389 --> 03:23:09.399 align:start position:0%
particularly have evolved to become a
 
03:23:12.229 --> 03:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
highly complex and sometimes expensive
 
03:23:15.469 --> 03:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
process lawyers and notifications and a
 
03:23:17.750 --> 03:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
bunch of those kinds of of and this may
 
03:23:19.830 --> 03:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
not be required for at least all
 
03:23:22.510 --> 03:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
building code appeals so we need to get
 
03:23:25.429 --> 03:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
many eyes on this to see if something of
 
03:23:27.429 --> 03:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
the somewhat onerous Provisions really
 
03:23:29.790 --> 03:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
need to be carried over or whether they
 
03:23:32.670 --> 03:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
can be skinny down for building code
 
03:23:35.830 --> 03:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
purposes and lastly as you can predict
 
03:23:37.590 --> 03:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
this is trying to edit a move somewhat
 
03:23:41.150 --> 03:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
moving ship uh 428 proposes to amend the
 
03:23:43.630 --> 03:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
process as does at least one other Bill
 
03:23:46.150 --> 03:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
currently in play we do think however
 
03:23:48.429 --> 03:23:48.439 align:start position:0%
that the the issues addressed in 428 are
 
03:23:50.670 --> 03:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
discreet enough to permit those to be
 
03:23:53.269 --> 03:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
moved but trying to trying to move this
 
03:23:55.150 --> 03:23:55.160 align:start position:0%
stuff at the same time other things are
 
03:23:58.389 --> 03:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
changing those same issues needs a lot
 
03:24:00.790 --> 03:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
of coordination so for this reason we
 
03:24:02.469 --> 03:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
would support moving this bill to a
 
03:24:05.349 --> 03:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with enough time allowed uh
 
03:24:07.150 --> 03:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
to deal with these issues and I'm happy
 
03:24:08.389 --> 03:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
to answer any
 
03:24:10.550 --> 03:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
03:24:10.560 --> 03:24:11.590 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
the

03:24:11.590 --> 03:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:24:13.950 --> 03:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
03:24:16.389 --> 03:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
much oh sorry I did not see you there
 
03:24:18.429 --> 03:24:18.439 align:start position:0%
Representative schmi no problem I didn't
 
03:24:20.910 --> 03:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
put I put my hand up just as you turned
 
03:24:26.269 --> 03:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
away so not not your fault at all so uh
 
03:24:29.189 --> 03:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
the question I have is uh this is
 
03:24:32.189 --> 03:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
certainly the kind of thing that oplc
 
03:24:38.150 --> 03:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
sorry not oplc OLS does uh when they uh
 
03:24:40.189 --> 03:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
when they have finished drafting a bill
 
03:24:43.630 --> 03:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
they have two uh other drafters one
 
03:24:47.269 --> 03:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
reads one uh reads out loud
 
03:24:49.990 --> 03:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
um and that's to see that they don't
 
03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
have typos and that type of thing um is
 
03:24:56.229 --> 03:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
this something that we that we should
 
03:24:58.830 --> 03:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
also ask them to look at because as
 
03:25:01.710 --> 03:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
drafters they can see has the language
 
03:25:04.630 --> 03:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
changed in any way which is the warning
 
03:25:07.110 --> 03:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
that we've heard from both of both you
 
03:25:09.910 --> 03:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
and chairman
 
03:25:12.150 --> 03:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
McGuire I think obviously that's a
 
03:25:14.790 --> 03:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
necessary step what I what I don't know
 
03:25:16.790 --> 03:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
and others can advise us us and
 
03:25:19.630 --> 03:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
certainly the the subcommittee can
 
03:25:22.429 --> 03:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
figure out is when that ought to happen
 
03:25:24.030 --> 03:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
our proposal is that some of the
 
03:25:26.590 --> 03:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
language ought to change because we've
 
03:25:29.269 --> 03:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
carried so much land
 
03:25:32.710 --> 03:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
use legal context over to the building
 
03:25:34.590 --> 03:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
code because all we did was copy it we
 
03:25:36.510 --> 03:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
didn't try and judge it we just copied
 
03:25:39.630 --> 03:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
it over right 25 pages of stuff that can
 
03:25:42.870 --> 03:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
probably be significantly reduced I
 
03:25:46.389 --> 03:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
think we'll we'll we'll see now whether
 
03:25:48.389 --> 03:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh OS ought to review it before that or
 
03:25:50.429 --> 03:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
after that or or how that works I'll
 
03:25:52.830 --> 03:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
leave for others but yeah I don't think
 
03:25:54.830 --> 03:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
if I might say impr preference to
 
03:25:57.349 --> 03:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
another question uh that I don't think
 
03:25:58.750 --> 03:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
that they would have done that if they
 
03:26:01.070 --> 03:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
were instructed to consolidate and
 
03:26:02.630 --> 03:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
transfer that's what they would have
 
03:26:05.910 --> 03:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
done uh but but you uh will be guiding
 
03:26:11.070 --> 03:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
Us in Your Capacity as uh enforcer or or
 
03:26:13.510 --> 03:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
consultant if you will on all these
 
03:26:16.510 --> 03:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
codes uh you're recommending the sub
 
03:26:18.070 --> 03:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
committee I presume you're going to
 
03:26:20.269 --> 03:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
participate vigorously and make
 
03:26:22.550 --> 03:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
suggestions along the lines that you
 
03:26:25.950 --> 03:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
think things should be slimmed down yes
 
03:26:28.229 --> 03:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
and we've also gotten uh some support
 
03:26:30.349 --> 03:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
from the municipal Association who have
 
03:26:32.229 --> 03:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
people who really understand these
 
03:26:35.189 --> 03:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
issues particularly on the land use side
 
03:26:37.110 --> 03:26:37.120 align:start position:0%

support the construction industry but
 
04:03:43.830 --> 04:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
also provide a boost to New Hampshire's
 
04:03:46.830 --> 04:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
local economy as a whole particularly if
 
04:03:48.910 --> 04:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
the state Embraces the growing trend of
 
04:03:52.189 --> 04:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
sustainable and resilient building while
 
04:03:54.510 --> 04:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
it's true that short-term construction
 
04:03:57.790 --> 04:03:57.800 align:start position:0%
costs may rise leading to higher housing
 
04:03:59.550 --> 04:03:59.560 align:start position:0%
prices and potential challenges for
 
04:04:02.309 --> 04:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
low-income families the adoption of the
 
04:04:04.910 --> 04:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
2021 building codes could help mitigate
 
04:04:07.229 --> 04:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
some of the state's housing challenges
 
04:04:10.710 --> 04:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
by reducing long-term costs the the
 
04:04:12.750 --> 04:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
improved efficiency of new homes could
 
04:04:14.110 --> 04:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
make them more affordable able to
 
04:04:16.389 --> 04:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
maintain overtime even if initial
 
04:04:18.189 --> 04:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
construction prices
 
04:04:20.950 --> 04:04:20.960 align:start position:0%

costs more stable in the long run
 
04:04:37.110 --> 04:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
additionally higher property value for
 
04:04:39.070 --> 04:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
energy efficient homes could encourage
 
04:04:41.110 --> 04:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
developers to build more especially in
 
04:04:43.950 --> 04:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
growing Urban and Suburban areas helping
 
04:04:45.990 --> 04:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
to address the ongoing housing shortage
 
04:04:49.630 --> 04:04:49.640 align:start position:0%
over time many other states have already
 
04:04:52.950 --> 04:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
adopted uh or are in the process of
 
04:04:55.469 --> 04:04:55.479 align:start position:0%
adopting newer energy codes and the New
 
04:04:57.590 --> 04:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire risk and New Hampshire risks
 
04:05:00.309 --> 04:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
sorry being left behind if it delays the
 
04:05:02.590 --> 04:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
transition by aligning with national
 
04:05:04.469 --> 04:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
standards New Hampshire would maintain
 
04:05:07.030 --> 04:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
competitiveness and improve
 
04:05:09.229 --> 04:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
marketability this alignment would also
 
04:05:10.830 --> 04:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that New Hampshire benefits from
 
04:05:13.309 --> 04:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
The Innovation and progress happening in
 
04:05:14.590 --> 04:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
the building building industry at a
 
04:05:16.670 --> 04:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
national level which could further
 
04:05:18.790 --> 04:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
enhance the state's reputation as a
 
04:05:21.189 --> 04:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
forward-thinking resilient place to live
 
04:05:24.429 --> 04:05:24.439 align:start position:0%
and work on balance however adopting the
 
04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
2021 building codes in New Hampshire by
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
2025 without further delay appears to
 
04:05:32.189 --> 04:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
yield better long-term results for the
 
04:05:34.429 --> 04:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
people of this of the state despite
 
04:05:37.149 --> 04:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
upfront challenges while there are valid
 
04:05:39.429 --> 04:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding implementation costs
 
04:05:42.149 --> 04:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
and the impact on housing affordability
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
the overall benefits in terms of of
 
04:05:46.870 --> 04:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
safety sustainability economic growth
 
04:05:49.030 --> 04:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
and Energy Efficiency seem to outweigh
 
04:05:50.189 --> 04:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
the potential
 
04:05:52.389 --> 04:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
drawbacks the Energy Efficiency
 
04:05:55.030 --> 04:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
improvements mandated by the 2021 codes
 
04:05:57.910 --> 04:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
will bring sufficient long-term benefits
 
04:06:00.630 --> 04:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
to homeowners businesses and States as a
 
04:06:03.670 --> 04:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
whole by lowering utility bills and
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
providing economic resilience over time
 
04:06:08.950 --> 04:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
the initial construction cost increases
 
04:06:11.790 --> 04:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
could be offset by these ongoing savings
 
04:06:13.149 --> 04:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
additionally with more efficient
 
04:06:15.469 --> 04:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
building New Hampshire can better manage
 
04:06:17.870 --> 04:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
Rising energy demand and reduce its
 
04:06:19.630 --> 04:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
carbon footprint which is crital
 
04:06:21.710 --> 04:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
critical for
 
04:06:23.550 --> 04:06:23.560 align:start position:0%
sustainability New Hampshire is
 
04:06:25.630 --> 04:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
increasingly exposed to extreme weather
 
04:06:28.070 --> 04:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
events including winter storms flooding
 
04:06:30.550 --> 04:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
and the effects of climate change uh
 
04:06:33.429 --> 04:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
which include intense rainfall Coastal
 
04:06:36.990 --> 04:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
erosion and high winds the 2021 codes
 
04:06:38.950 --> 04:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
improve the resilience of buildings by
 
04:06:41.950 --> 04:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
addressing these these issues while
 
04:06:43.309 --> 04:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
these improvements come with upfront
 
04:06:45.030 --> 04:06:45.040 align:start position:0%

04:06:47.710 --> 04:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
for extensive repairs or rebuilding
 
04:06:50.149 --> 04:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
after storms which can make which can be
 
04:06:52.229 --> 04:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
more expensive than proactive investment

Builders and homeowners uh thank you and
 
04:07:55.469 --> 04:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
I actually have a handout uh that comes
 
04:07:57.710 --> 04:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
from uh Governor Shaheen's office that
 
04:07:59.950 --> 04:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
identifies funding that could be related
 
04:08:02.429 --> 04:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
to this adopting these codes and I'll
 
04:08:05.990 --> 04:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
Governor Shaheen's Governor Shaheen so
 
04:08:10.030 --> 04:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
it's um 20 years Governor geeez I'm

sers represent
 
04:08:35.469 --> 04:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
long you may not be the best person to
 
04:08:38.189 --> 04:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
ask about this um so for anyone else who
 
04:08:40.189 --> 04:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
testifying I would like to hear this
 
04:08:42.030 --> 04:08:42.040 align:start position:0%

able to answer it um um do you have a an
 
04:08:49.389 --> 04:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
estimate of what the additional upfront
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
costs are of building a house uh if the
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
new energy code is adopted and what the
 
04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
annual Energy savings
 
04:09:02.030 --> 04:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
are those do have estimates from what I
 
04:09:04.710 --> 04:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
understand those estimates may not be as
 
04:09:07.349 --> 04:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
reliable as as people think they are and
 
04:09:09.910 --> 04:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
I am not the best person to answer that
 
04:09:12.030 --> 04:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
we have other people who should provide
 
04:09:15.030 --> 04:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
more information
 
04:09:16.710 --> 04:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
yes you're on the list to answer that
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
04:09:22.189 --> 04:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
you representative L uh thank you madam
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
04:09:25.670 --> 04:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
bringing this to us um you spoke about
 
04:09:27.710 --> 04:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
some pretty good Market opportunities
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
where people will make more money
 
04:09:30.830 --> 04:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
building these homes I'm just curious if
 
04:09:32.149 --> 04:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
you have anything that would prevent
 
04:09:34.750 --> 04:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
that from happening
 
04:09:37.149 --> 04:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
today well no we're still building in
 
04:09:39.149 --> 04:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um it's just that we're
 
04:09:41.510 --> 04:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
building buildings that are not as
 
04:09:43.630 --> 04:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
potentially as res resilient as they
 
04:09:45.710 --> 04:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
could be so we're building buildings
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
today that may not have as good a resale
 
04:09:50.950 --> 04:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
value had we been doing it using these
 
04:09:50.960 --> 04:09:52.109 align:start position:0%
value had we been doing it using these
21

04:09:52.109 --> 04:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
21
 
04:09:54.870 --> 04:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
codes that's all right follow up uh so
 
04:09:56.109 --> 04:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
you're saying that right now people are
 
04:09:58.510 --> 04:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
limited and cannot adopt these um these
 
04:09:58.520 --> 04:10:00.550 align:start position:0%
limited and cannot adopt these um these
new

04:10:00.550 --> 04:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:10:02.510 --> 04:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
technologies or you simp or are you
 
04:10:03.990 --> 04:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
saying they simply aren't being forced
 
04:10:05.790 --> 04:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
to adopt these Technologies because it
 
04:10:07.550 --> 04:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
was my understanding that you can build
 
04:10:09.189 --> 04:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
a passive house or anything that is
 
04:10:11.189 --> 04:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
highly energy efficient and that's a
 
04:10:13.630 --> 04:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
choice that can be made there is a
 
04:10:15.389 --> 04:10:15.399 align:start position:0%
choice right now it's not mandated I
 
04:10:16.990 --> 04:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
think this is looking for a mandate I
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
mean what you're saying is true a friend
 
04:10:20.510 --> 04:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
of mine just sold our house and and is
 
04:10:21.950 --> 04:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
building a net zero house in
 
04:10:23.590 --> 04:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I mean there are some
 
04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
builders that will do that but it's not
 
04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.030 --> 04:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
okay salers thank you madam chair so one
 
04:10:37.710 --> 04:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
question I have is
 
04:10:42.990 --> 04:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
um the difference between 2018 21 do you
 
04:10:45.590 --> 04:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
know what those changes are I'm just
 
04:10:46.990 --> 04:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get an idea of what the
 
04:10:49.510 --> 04:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
Builder has to put in to make the
 
04:10:51.910 --> 04:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
difference I am quite certain the people
 
04:10:53.710 --> 04:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
that will testify behind me will be able
 
04:10:57.910 --> 04:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
question anyone
 
04:11:02.830 --> 04:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
else all right thank you very much and
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
we'll start with some of the people that
 
04:11:15.229 --> 04:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:16.990 --> 04:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
Madam chair members of the committee for
 
04:11:18.550 --> 04:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Philip Sherman
 
04:11:20.710 --> 04:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
chair of the building code review board
 
04:11:22.990 --> 04:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
the bcrb at this time takes no position
 
04:11:27.149 --> 04:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
on this bill but would ask uh the
 
04:11:29.790 --> 04:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor not withstanding uh that it be
 
04:11:32.950 --> 04:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
amended to refer to the 2024 edition of
 
04:11:34.790 --> 04:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
the international energy conservation
 
04:11:37.670 --> 04:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
code AS required by Statute we're
 
04:11:40.229 --> 04:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
entering into our review of the 2024
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
code expected to be completed by June
 
04:11:45.229 --> 04:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
and it only makes sense that we all look
 
04:11:47.830 --> 04:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
at the same document uh at that point
 
04:11:50.630 --> 04:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
I'll happy to answer any
 
04:11:54.670 --> 04:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative Howard uh
 
04:11:57.269 --> 04:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so are
 
04:12:00.070 --> 04:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
there any potential glitches uh that
 
04:12:03.229 --> 04:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
occurred in the 2021 codes as and and
 
04:12:04.670 --> 04:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
could be the reason why we didn't adopt
 
04:12:07.229 --> 04:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
them thank
 
04:12:10.590 --> 04:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
you I I guess I don't understand the
 
04:12:13.710 --> 04:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
question uh so obviously we kind of have
 
04:12:16.149 --> 04:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
a three-year lag in adopting our uh
 
04:12:19.750 --> 04:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
building codes and in 2021 we did or in
 
04:12:22.670 --> 04:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
2024 we did not adoped the 2021 building
 
04:12:26.149 --> 04:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
codes uh it's kind of the question I I
 
04:12:27.469 --> 04:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
was not on the committee I didn't know
 
04:12:29.149 --> 04:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily if you knew uh what
 
04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
potential glitches were and why we did
 
04:12:34.030 --> 04:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
not adopt yeah just to if I may correct
 
04:12:36.750 --> 04:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
one thing we adopted the 2021 codes
 
04:12:38.710 --> 04:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
except for the energy code which we held
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
back at the 18 code uh that was after an
 
04:12:44.269 --> 04:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
extensive uh amount of committee work on
 
04:12:47.229 --> 04:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
on our part board's part uh with much
 
04:12:50.189 --> 04:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
input from outside um and the vote at
 
04:12:52.469 --> 04:12:52.479 align:start position:0%
that time was N9 to4 to stay on the 18
 
04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
code uh much of it I think came down to
 
04:12:58.389 --> 04:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
cost um and others can explain the
 
04:13:01.910 --> 04:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
details of that um my understanding is
 
04:13:06.189 --> 04:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
that the 2024 code uh corrects some of
 
04:13:08.790 --> 04:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
the issues that people found with the
 
04:13:12.109 --> 04:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
2021 code but that's just uh what I'm
 
04:13:14.429 --> 04:13:14.439 align:start position:0%
hearing I don't have facts to back that
 
04:13:19.149 --> 04:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
up represent thank you U Mr Sherman from
 
04:13:22.109 --> 04:13:22.119 align:start position:0%
a practicality standpoint is it better
 
04:13:25.149 --> 04:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
that we adopt building codes that are of
 
04:13:26.710 --> 04:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
the same
 
04:13:29.710 --> 04:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
year so that the energy code and the
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
building codes should go hand inand as
 
04:13:34.790 --> 04:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to accepting one that's three
 
04:13:36.790 --> 04:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
years behind the
 
04:13:39.550 --> 04:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
other I'll speak only for myself because
 
04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
I know that there are people who may
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
disagree with this there are some places
 
04:13:46.630 --> 04:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
where those codes interact in a in a
 
04:13:49.109 --> 04:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
significant way for instance if if a
 
04:13:51.189 --> 04:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
code requires a mechanical system then
 
04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
the Mechanical Code might refer to how
 
04:13:55.469 --> 04:13:55.479 align:start position:0%
to how to put that together so we need
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
to keep track of that stuff um I don't
 
04:14:01.149 --> 04:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
think it's been terribly difficult or at
 
04:14:04.030 --> 04:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
least I haven't heard of major problems
 
04:14:05.750 --> 04:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh with the implementation of these
 
04:14:08.189 --> 04:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
codes to this point but again that's
 
04:14:11.429 --> 04:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
only a few months now
 
04:14:14.389 --> 04:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
so thank you represent sellers thank you
 
04:14:17.790 --> 04:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair so it makes sense bringing
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
in the latest code I get that but are
 
04:14:23.149 --> 04:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
you asking them to for the amendment to
 
04:14:24.750 --> 04:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
change it to the latest
 
04:14:27.109 --> 04:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
code before the latest code has actually
 
04:14:27.119 --> 04:14:27.990 align:start position:0%
code before the latest code has actually
been

04:14:27.990 --> 04:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:14:31.469 --> 04:14:31.479 align:start position:0%
approved no I let me let me be sure to
 
04:14:34.030 --> 04:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
clarify we're taking no position on the
 
04:14:36.670 --> 04:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
bill itself whether it's a good idea or
 
04:14:39.109 --> 04:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
a bad idea what we would ask is that it
 
04:14:42.309 --> 04:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
be amended to to talk about the 2024
 
04:14:43.750 --> 04:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
code if you're going to to talk about a
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
code just so we're not going in opposite
 
04:14:50.990 --> 04:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
directions here follow up thank you so
 
04:14:53.790 --> 04:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
has the 2024 code been approved though
 
04:14:55.710 --> 04:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
no it's been published it was published
 
04:14:57.710 --> 04:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
last May so it's been out on the street
 
04:15:00.990 --> 04:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
for people to read our board by Statute
 
04:15:02.950 --> 04:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
is given the timing of when we're
 
04:15:05.149 --> 04:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to review these codes is just
 
04:15:08.070 --> 04:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
starting our review now thank you which
 
04:15:11.149 --> 04:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
will end in June presumably that's and
 
04:15:14.550 --> 04:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
that's the full Suite of 20 24 codes not
 
04:15:16.950 --> 04:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
just the energy code that's right yeah
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative Schmid thank you
 
04:15:19.920 --> 04:15:20.750 align:start position:0%
okay representative Schmid thank you
madam

04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
madam
 
04:15:23.830 --> 04:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
chair so the the bill is premised on the
 
04:15:28.030 --> 04:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
idea that a greater degree of efficiency
 
04:15:29.950 --> 04:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
and a
 
04:15:36.149 --> 04:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
whole gamut of areas um I don't have to
 
04:15:38.550 --> 04:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
speak to you about what they are because
 
04:15:41.189 --> 04:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
that's your that's your area of
 
04:15:43.990 --> 04:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
expertise but other are there not
 
04:15:46.830 --> 04:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
studies out there I don't think the bcrb
 
04:15:48.710 --> 04:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
is probably doing that but are there
 
04:15:50.630 --> 04:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
studies of it out there that you're
 
04:15:55.429 --> 04:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
aware of that speak to the idea of the E
 
04:15:58.870 --> 04:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
efficiency because I don't think that U
 
04:16:03.309 --> 04:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
representative uh has you know come up
 
04:16:06.750 --> 04:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
with this whole concept on her own um
 
04:16:09.910 --> 04:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
because it requires a lot of expertise
 
04:16:13.870 --> 04:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
that uh that uh the economy looks at all
 
04:16:16.710 --> 04:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
the time right what is the most
 
04:16:19.030 --> 04:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
efficient way to do this and that's the
 
04:16:23.309 --> 04:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
basis of selling X Y and Z to to improve
 
04:16:25.590 --> 04:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
your house in any one of a number of
 
04:16:27.550 --> 04:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
different ways so are you aware of
 
04:16:31.030 --> 04:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
studies that that validate the the
 
04:16:36.870 --> 04:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
underlying premise of uh of Wendy's um
 
04:16:43.710 --> 04:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:46.870 --> 04:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm grasping pretty wide I
 
04:16:49.349 --> 04:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
understand but this is an area you're
 
04:16:52.149 --> 04:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
probably fishing into some
 
04:16:54.950 --> 04:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
degree it's an area that our board is
 
04:16:58.149 --> 04:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
fishing in to some degree um I'm not an
 
04:17:00.109 --> 04:17:00.119 align:start position:0%
expert on the energy code I know just
 
04:17:04.469 --> 04:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
enough to get into trouble um my charge
 
04:17:07.389 --> 04:17:07.399 align:start position:0%
mostly is to try and manage the process
 
04:17:09.309 --> 04:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
so we have a committee of our board
 
04:17:12.590 --> 04:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
members five I think uh who are entering
 
04:17:15.189 --> 04:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
the the the period of reviewing that at
 
04:17:17.630 --> 04:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
the same time they will go back and look
 
04:17:19.950 --> 04:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
at the report that was generated last
 
04:17:22.670 --> 04:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
year when they when they analyzed the
 
04:17:25.269 --> 04:17:25.279 align:start position:0%
2021 code I'm sorry yeah whenever that
 
04:17:27.830 --> 04:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
was two years ago um so they've got to
 
04:17:30.389 --> 04:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
look at two two jumps of this thing if
 
04:17:31.349 --> 04:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
we go to
 
04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
2024 if we only go to
 
04:17:37.349 --> 04:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
2021 um we have no charge to go back and
 
04:17:40.109 --> 04:17:40.119 align:start position:0%
relook at that that report is is on the
 
04:17:43.950 --> 04:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
website it's publicly available um
 
04:17:45.389 --> 04:17:45.399 align:start position:0%
and we'll just do what the legislature
 
04:17:48.870 --> 04:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
says you know if if that's a
 
04:17:52.109 --> 04:17:52.119 align:start position:0%
decision thank you other questions
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative Howard so thank you for
 
04:17:56.870 --> 04:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh since there's a
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
threee since we usually look at uh
 
04:18:02.030 --> 04:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
adopting these codes in a three-year lag
 
04:18:03.990 --> 04:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
would it be okay to potentially look at
 
04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
the 2021 codes this year and then in
 
04:18:10.030 --> 04:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
2027 when we approach uh the time when
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
we look at uh adopting all of the 2024
 
04:18:18.189 --> 04:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:22.070 --> 04:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
acceptable be acceptable to somebody um
 
04:18:24.109 --> 04:18:24.119 align:start position:0%
let me if I might just give a little bit
 
04:18:26.590 --> 04:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
of history there was a delay in adopting
 
04:18:32.990 --> 04:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
the 2015 codes um when they got adopted
 
04:18:36.750 --> 04:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
we then worked on the 2018 codes which I
 
04:18:39.469 --> 04:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
think happened slightly into Co so we've
 
04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
had a lot of sand in the gears if you
 
04:18:44.429 --> 04:18:44.439 align:start position:0%
will on getting on to an orderly
 
04:18:46.950 --> 04:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
sequence the decision of the board and
 
04:18:48.590 --> 04:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
it was reviewed with the advisory
 
04:18:51.070 --> 04:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
committee at one point was that we would
 
04:18:53.790 --> 04:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
spend two years on the 2018 codes which
 
04:18:56.910 --> 04:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
we did and then two years on the 2021
 
04:18:59.309 --> 04:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
codes which we're in the middle of now
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
and then once we get to the 2024 code
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
was the time to go on to an orderly
 
04:19:08.990 --> 04:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
three-year hopefully adoption sequence
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
which would still leave us a a cycle
 
04:19:13.630 --> 04:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
behind the published codes which is
 
04:19:15.990 --> 04:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
where the legislature wants us but it
 
04:19:17.550 --> 04:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
would then get onto a much more
 
04:19:17.560 --> 04:19:18.870 align:start position:0%
would then get onto a much more
predictable

04:19:18.870 --> 04:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
predictable
 
04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
thing if everything goes well um so
 
04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
certainly codes can be moved down the
 
04:19:28.950 --> 04:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
road but but it moves us away you know
 
04:19:30.510 --> 04:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
farther down the road to get to this
 
04:19:32.630 --> 04:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
three-year cycle which seems to be
 
04:19:35.030 --> 04:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
desired by a lot of people it's to get
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
onto something more predictable yes I
 
04:19:41.510 --> 04:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
will mention that the the history was
 
04:19:44.109 --> 04:19:44.119 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to who adopt any of
 
04:19:46.349 --> 04:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
the codes immediately after their
 
04:19:49.309 --> 04:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
publication because there are
 
04:19:52.590 --> 04:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
generally what one might call typos and
 
04:19:54.950 --> 04:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
and mistakes that the early adopters are
 
04:19:58.109 --> 04:19:58.119 align:start position:0%
very nicely finding for us and so we can
 
04:20:02.109 --> 04:20:02.119 align:start position:0%
not Implement those sections a two or
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
adopting them two couple of years after
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
they're out gives time to flush out
 
04:20:09.990 --> 04:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:17.229 --> 04:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
so I think one of the issues that this
 
04:20:18.990 --> 04:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
committee has been wrestling with are
 
04:20:22.149 --> 04:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
the the benefits of these codes of the
 
04:20:24.349 --> 04:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
energy code in light of the potential
 
04:20:27.389 --> 04:20:27.399 align:start position:0%
increase in costs since we've adopted
 
04:20:27.399 --> 04:20:28.469 align:start position:0%
increase in costs since we've adopted
the

04:20:28.469 --> 04:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:30.590 --> 04:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
2018 energy
 
04:20:34.349 --> 04:20:34.359 align:start position:0%
codes to whom should we
 
04:20:34.359 --> 04:20:37.870 align:start position:0%
codes to whom should we
look

04:20:37.870 --> 04:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:43.630 --> 04:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
for a review of the benefits that's that
 
04:20:46.670 --> 04:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
people have well that the construction
 
04:20:49.109 --> 04:20:49.119 align:start position:0%
industry and their customers have
 
04:20:51.189 --> 04:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
benefited from like we we adopted these
 
04:20:53.070 --> 04:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
codes I remember when we did that it was
 
04:20:53.080 --> 04:20:53.870 align:start position:0%
codes I remember when we did that it was
quite

04:20:53.870 --> 04:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
quite
 
04:20:56.950 --> 04:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
controversial so well not controversial
 
04:20:58.590 --> 04:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
but it was a lot there were a lot of
 
04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
teeth nashing you know we all we made
 
04:21:06.229 --> 04:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
the decision to do it so what benefit
 
04:21:08.309 --> 04:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
have we
 
04:21:13.349 --> 04:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
seen as a state from home build whose
 
04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:21.550 --> 04:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
changes let me be sure I understand your
 
04:21:23.710 --> 04:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
question of the benefits of stay of
 
04:21:26.469 --> 04:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
having stayed on the 18 code there are
 
04:21:28.429 --> 04:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
others here who can answer that question
 
04:21:31.710 --> 04:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
right okay I excuse followup follow up
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
the benefits
 
04:21:36.990 --> 04:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
of yes of adopting those 2018 energy
 
04:21:39.550 --> 04:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
code and I thought of another question I
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
think I think we did that in the
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
in TW in 20 21 21 I believe 21 yes and
 
04:21:54.269 --> 04:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
uh and in 24 we declined to go to the uh
 
04:21:54.279 --> 04:21:55.429 align:start position:0%
uh and in 24 we declined to go to the uh
21

04:21:55.429 --> 04:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
21
 
04:21:58.630 --> 04:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
code so the home builder should have
 
04:22:01.309 --> 04:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
information from their point of view I'm
 
04:22:04.269 --> 04:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
not sure who else would be
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
tracking uh the benefits to the owners
 
04:22:10.910 --> 04:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
of homes built to that code
 
04:22:13.070 --> 04:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
um follow up
 
04:22:14.630 --> 04:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
and do you
 
04:22:18.750 --> 04:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
recall um did we adopt only part of the
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
code is it possible that when we review
 
04:22:24.349 --> 04:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
these codes we find that we want to
 
04:22:26.510 --> 04:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
adopt some of them and not others is
 
04:22:28.149 --> 04:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
that possible to do that or do we have
 
04:22:30.750 --> 04:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
to adopt them in in their
 
04:22:34.149 --> 04:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
entity well by not adopting the 2021
 
04:22:36.990 --> 04:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
energy code two years ago we we've done
 
04:22:39.510 --> 04:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
what you said right we've broken that
 
04:22:42.630 --> 04:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
package um the energy code itself for
 
04:22:44.309 --> 04:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
those of you who have not been into it
 
04:22:46.790 --> 04:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
consists of two codes one for
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
residential buildings up to three
 
04:22:50.229 --> 04:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
stories the other for sort of everything
 
04:22:53.109 --> 04:22:53.119 align:start position:0%
else larger residential and all the the
 
04:22:55.550 --> 04:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
span of commercial other than some
 
04:22:59.670 --> 04:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
fairly small commercial entities so
 
04:23:01.469 --> 04:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
there was a proposal by one
 
04:23:04.149 --> 04:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
representative last year that perhaps we
 
04:23:06.590 --> 04:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
would split the two parts of the energy
 
04:23:10.309 --> 04:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
code uh it's certainly doable but I
 
04:23:11.870 --> 04:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
think some of the building officials
 
04:23:13.750 --> 04:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
here and maybe the designers will
 
04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
comment on the difficulty and having to
 
04:23:18.149 --> 04:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
try and remember which book you're in
 
04:23:21.070 --> 04:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
for what what project and what part of
 
04:23:24.109 --> 04:23:24.119 align:start position:0%
what project um I've not seen that done
 
04:23:26.070 --> 04:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
in any other jurisdiction I can't say it
 
04:23:28.429 --> 04:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done I just haven't seen it
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
um but it was a proposal last year and I
 
04:23:34.389 --> 04:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
will say that last year we did adopt one
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
specific element of the 21 code which
 
04:23:40.109 --> 04:23:40.119 align:start position:0%
was the air change
 
04:23:43.630 --> 04:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
requirement U that was was specifically
 
04:23:47.309 --> 04:23:47.319 align:start position:0%
adopted as an amendment to the 18
 
04:23:49.429 --> 04:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
code representative
 
04:23:53.070 --> 04:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you so would it be your
 
04:23:54.670 --> 04:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
board that could actually give us a list
 
04:23:59.309 --> 04:23:59.319 align:start position:0%
of differences from 18 to 24 so we know
 
04:24:02.189 --> 04:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
what the changes are yeah that's one of
 
04:24:04.070 --> 04:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
the things we're grappling with right
 
04:24:07.030 --> 04:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
now is how to present that um there are
 
04:24:10.510 --> 04:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
lists there's already a list of 18 to 21
 
04:24:12.670 --> 04:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
and then that needs to be melded some
 
04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
somehow from 21 to 24 just for our
 
04:24:18.389 --> 04:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
purposes which then goes to the report
 
04:24:20.750 --> 04:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
that comes to you folks
 
04:24:23.229 --> 04:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
yeah all right representative L thank
 
04:24:25.630 --> 04:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um just to make sure
 
04:24:27.429 --> 04:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
that I understand this whole process
 
04:24:29.469 --> 04:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
normally you're reviewing them and then
 
04:24:31.710 --> 04:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
giving us the input before we look to
 
04:24:33.630 --> 04:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
make a change in the law and this would
 
04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
be changing the process our our charge
 
04:24:39.070 --> 04:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
involves recommending leg legislation
 
04:24:42.070 --> 04:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
yeah nothing we do goes anywhere until
 
04:24:45.389 --> 04:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
it comes here and on from here there a
 
04:24:46.950 --> 04:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
followup this would sort of be putting
 
04:24:48.750 --> 04:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
the cart before the horse to tell you to
 
04:24:51.149 --> 04:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
adopt the 24 before you've had a chance
 
04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
to do that review or at least changing
 
04:24:56.510 --> 04:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
the normal order well no it it tells
 
04:24:59.349 --> 04:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
this is tells them to adopt the 21 code
 
04:25:01.469 --> 04:25:01.479 align:start position:0%
which they have already reviewed and
 
04:25:05.469 --> 04:25:05.479 align:start position:0%
have the um the changes and the the
 
04:25:09.030 --> 04:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
committee vote not to adopt okay thank
 
04:25:14.670 --> 04:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:15.600 --> 04:25:15.610 align:start position:0%
yes I
 
04:25:15.610 --> 04:25:17.149 align:start position:0%
yes I
[Laughter]

04:25:17.149 --> 04:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:25:20.269 --> 04:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
think yes it it it impacts the normal
 
04:25:21.990 --> 04:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
order of things which is we do the
 
04:25:23.750 --> 04:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
review then it comes here for your
 
04:25:26.469 --> 04:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
review and approval or
 
04:25:28.670 --> 04:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
denial and then to the Governor from
 
04:25:31.149 --> 04:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
there so other
 
04:25:33.469 --> 04:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
04:25:33.479 --> 04:25:34.469 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
you're

04:25:34.469 --> 04:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
welcome all
 
04:25:39.389 --> 04:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
right yes representative schi sorry
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you is this going to
 
04:25:44.030 --> 04:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh
 
04:25:44.910 --> 04:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:25:44.920 --> 04:25:47.590 align:start position:0%
I think
so

04:25:47.590 --> 04:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:50.590 --> 04:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
okay and we have always had help from
 
04:26:05.030 --> 04:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
Mayberry good
 
04:26:09.630 --> 04:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Matt Mayberry I'm
 
04:26:10.910 --> 04:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
the CEO of the New Hampshire
 
04:26:12.990 --> 04:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
homebuilders Association
 
04:26:15.790 --> 04:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
we represent the 27,000 people in New
 
04:26:18.349 --> 04:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire your constituents that work in
 
04:26:20.309 --> 04:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
the Residential Building
 
04:26:23.710 --> 04:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
Trades we cannot find the words to come
 
04:26:25.670 --> 04:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
out more strongly
 
04:26:27.710 --> 04:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
against this
 
04:26:30.269 --> 04:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
bill and I can tell you why we've had
 
04:26:31.670 --> 04:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
this conversation before so it's kind of
 
04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
like deja vu all over
 
04:26:37.229 --> 04:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
again the cost of the 21 energy code and
 
04:26:39.070 --> 04:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to back up quick
 
04:26:41.309 --> 04:26:41.319 align:start position:0%
second the last two speakers kind of
 
04:26:43.429 --> 04:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
convoluted things
 
04:26:46.070 --> 04:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
so let's open the drapes and make it
 
04:26:46.080 --> 04:26:47.990 align:start position:0%
so let's open the drapes and make it
really

04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:26:51.469 --> 04:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
clear we supported and adopted as a
 
04:26:53.910 --> 04:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
state and the New Hampshire homebuilders
 
04:26:58.910 --> 04:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
supported it the 2021 building
 
04:27:02.070 --> 04:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
codes that's law that's what my folks
 
04:27:04.670 --> 04:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
are building right
 
04:27:08.269 --> 04:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
now the energy codes which are being
 
04:27:12.309 --> 04:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
very cleverly weaved into building codes
 
04:27:14.349 --> 04:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
the energy
 
04:27:16.870 --> 04:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
codes we worked with you
 
04:27:21.550 --> 04:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
folks and passed the 2018 energy
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
codes for real simple reasons $76
 
04:27:30.910 --> 04:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
million of consumer housing debt shoved
 
04:27:33.550 --> 04:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
down the throats of home
 
04:27:36.670 --> 04:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
buyers that's based upon the
 
04:27:39.750 --> 04:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
4,520 correction
 
04:27:42.990 --> 04:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
4,512 building permits that pulled in
 
04:27:46.510 --> 04:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
23 at an average cost and I was going to
 
04:27:49.070 --> 04:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
leave her name out of it but since
 
04:27:50.510 --> 04:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas brought forward
 
04:27:50.520 --> 04:27:51.349 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas brought forward
Senator

04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
04:27:55.389 --> 04:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
Shaheen Senator Shaheen states that to
 
04:27:59.229 --> 04:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
upgrade to the 21 energy code cost
 
04:28:02.670 --> 04:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
$177,000 that's low but let's use her
 
04:28:06.790 --> 04:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
numbers that's $76 million of Consumer
 
04:28:09.389 --> 04:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
Debt on your
 
04:28:11.309 --> 04:28:11.319 align:start position:0%
constituents most people can't write a
 
04:28:12.950 --> 04:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
check for $17
 
04:28:15.790 --> 04:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
,000 so the roll into their
 
04:28:15.800 --> 04:28:17.910 align:start position:0%
,000 so the roll into their
mortgage

04:28:17.910 --> 04:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
mortgage
 
04:28:22.109 --> 04:28:22.119 align:start position:0%
6.5% 30-year fixed that comes out to be
 
04:28:24.349 --> 04:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
over $200
 
04:28:28.389 --> 04:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
million of Consumer Debt for the next 30
 
04:28:33.229 --> 04:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
years on that same program on WMUR with
 
04:28:36.070 --> 04:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
Adam Sexton he asked her what's the
 
04:28:36.080 --> 04:28:37.870 align:start position:0%
Adam Sexton he asked her what's the
annual

04:28:37.870 --> 04:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
annual
 
04:28:39.950 --> 04:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
payback on these
 
04:28:41.830 --> 04:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
upgrades and she looked right at him and
 
04:28:45.510 --> 04:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:48.149 --> 04:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
year I do not go to
 
04:28:50.710 --> 04:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
college but I don't need a degree from
 
04:28:53.830 --> 04:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
Harvard to do the simple math you will
 
04:28:55.710 --> 04:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
never live to see your
 
04:28:58.109 --> 04:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
payback your grandchildren won't live to
 
04:29:00.469 --> 04:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
payback there was a
 
04:29:05.670 --> 04:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
conversation about well just you know
 
04:29:08.750 --> 04:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
amend the bill to do the 24 energy
 
04:29:12.109 --> 04:29:12.119 align:start position:0%
codes please don't do that we here
 
04:29:15.229 --> 04:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
talking about the 21 energy codes don't
 
04:29:19.149 --> 04:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
shove please the 2024 energy codes down
 
04:29:21.630 --> 04:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
our throats let us go through the
 
04:29:24.229 --> 04:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
process let's talk about that separately
 
04:29:26.790 --> 04:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
because if we did the math and I did
 
04:29:29.030 --> 04:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
beforehand from the National Association
 
04:29:31.149 --> 04:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
of home builders if we were to jump from
 
04:29:31.159 --> 04:29:31.990 align:start position:0%
of home builders if we were to jump from
the

04:29:31.990 --> 04:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:29:38.389 --> 04:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
18 energy code to the 24 energy code we
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:44.510 --> 04:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
$31,000 that's 100 that just shy of 140
 
04:29:46.670 --> 04:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
million of Consumer
 
04:29:49.590 --> 04:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
Debt let's be super conservative let's
 
04:29:50.510 --> 04:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
cut it in
 
04:29:53.349 --> 04:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
half that's
 
04:29:57.389 --> 04:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
$15,500 that's $69 million of Consumer
 
04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
Debt the largest tax
 
04:30:03.429 --> 04:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
increase placed upon the home buyers of
 
04:30:05.510 --> 04:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
the grant
 
04:30:07.590 --> 04:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
state that comes out at the end of a
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
30-year mortgage to $182
 
04:30:13.550 --> 04:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
million of consumer debt this is the
 
04:30:15.229 --> 04:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
green energy
 
04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
tax make no
 
04:30:22.830 --> 04:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:25.109 --> 04:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
mandate the reason why we go through the
 
04:30:27.389 --> 04:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
process of reviewing these things and
 
04:30:30.710 --> 04:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
then coming to you asking you to adopt
 
04:30:32.710 --> 04:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
say the 24 energy
 
04:30:34.590 --> 04:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
code and the reason why there's a
 
04:30:38.070 --> 04:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
three-year lag is we're very sensitive
 
04:30:39.790 --> 04:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
to the unintended
 
04:30:43.229 --> 04:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
consequences and the unintended cost
 
04:30:45.510 --> 04:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
that's why we do have a three-year
 
04:30:49.109 --> 04:30:49.119 align:start position:0%
lag that's why we said we can
 
04:30:53.469 --> 04:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
build the 2021 building codes no problem
 
04:30:56.750 --> 04:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
we'll do that we'll do our
 
04:31:02.349 --> 04:31:02.359 align:start position:0%
part but if we want with the 2021 energy
 
04:31:05.429 --> 04:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
code folks you're going to make
 
04:31:08.590 --> 04:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
attainable housing just a nice idea for
 
04:31:09.950 --> 04:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
someone from Cambridge to come up and
 
04:31:12.670 --> 04:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
buy a house with
 
04:31:14.469 --> 04:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
Rank and file people living in New
 
04:31:17.349 --> 04:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can't afford it I was at the
 
04:31:18.830 --> 04:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
housing committee yesterday testing on
 
04:31:21.750 --> 04:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
three bills and we heard over 30 people
 
04:31:23.710 --> 04:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
testifying how they can't afford to live
 
04:31:25.790 --> 04:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
in New
 
04:31:28.389 --> 04:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire why in the
 
04:31:32.229 --> 04:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
world would we strap on another $20,000
 
04:31:34.510 --> 04:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
on top of a house that folks already
 
04:31:39.630 --> 04:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:42.630 --> 04:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
that it's pretty simple
 
04:31:46.910 --> 04:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
so um we have a sample of what the 24
 
04:31:48.630 --> 04:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
code will look like because one of the
 
04:31:52.030 --> 04:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
questions was what does 18 to 24 look
 
04:31:56.309 --> 04:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
like to repair the air leaks about
 
04:31:59.429 --> 04:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
$3,000 to go to a ground Source heat
 
04:32:01.750 --> 04:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
pump just shy
 
04:32:04.070 --> 04:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
$22,000 to upgrade air conditioning
 
04:32:06.309 --> 04:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
units that's at least
 
04:32:08.109 --> 04:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
$1,200 of an
 
04:32:12.229 --> 04:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
upgrade to go to the higher efficiency
 
04:32:16.030 --> 04:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:18.870 --> 04:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
$6,500 ladies and gentlemen let me be
 
04:32:18.880 --> 04:32:20.070 align:start position:0%
$6,500 ladies and gentlemen let me be
really

04:32:20.070 --> 04:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:32:24.189 --> 04:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
clear our 27,000 people will build any
 
04:32:27.070 --> 04:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
home you want it's your
 
04:32:30.309 --> 04:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
choice if you want a net zero home tell
 
04:32:32.670 --> 04:32:32.680 align:start position:0%
us we'll build
 
04:32:35.149 --> 04:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
it we're working with you folks on an
 
04:32:39.590 --> 04:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
Adu for 950 square feet we'll build
 
04:32:43.309 --> 04:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
it we're consumer-driven
 
04:32:45.790 --> 04:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
if you want it we'll build it but please
 
04:32:45.800 --> 04:32:48.030 align:start position:0%
if you want it we'll build it but please
don't

04:32:48.030 --> 04:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:32:51.870 --> 04:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
mandate 76 million dollar of Consumer
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
Debt on home buyers in New Hampshire
 
04:32:54.960 --> 04:32:56.870 align:start position:0%
Debt on home buyers in New Hampshire
especially

04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
especially
 
04:32:58.950 --> 04:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
now so as you can tell I get a little
 
04:33:02.429 --> 04:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
excited about that so I'll dial it back
 
04:33:05.269 --> 04:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
um but we're here to work with you we
 
04:33:07.230 --> 04:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
work with the
 
04:33:09.310 --> 04:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
bcrb we live in New Hampshire we love
 
04:33:13.349 --> 04:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm GNA stop talking now
 
04:33:15.109 --> 04:33:15.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank thank you are there any
 
04:33:19.269 --> 04:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee pres
 
04:33:21.189 --> 04:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
schmi can you be here for the
 
04:33:25.230 --> 04:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee Matt yes sir okay thank you
 
04:33:26.670 --> 04:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
any other
 
04:33:29.470 --> 04:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
questions oh repr long thank
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
you would this change uh discourage new
 
04:33:38.310 --> 04:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
construction and if it would I guess how
 
04:33:41.189 --> 04:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
much more efficient is the 2018 Building
 
04:33:42.709 --> 04:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
Code versus
 
04:33:46.830 --> 04:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:48.551 --> 04:33:48.561 align:start position:0%
replacing I'm a little confused
 
04:33:51.189 --> 04:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry um so if if
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
we're at the 2018 energy code because
 
04:33:56.750 --> 04:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's what this is about because we
 
04:33:59.629 --> 04:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
already have the 21 Energy building code
 
04:34:03.551 --> 04:34:03.561 align:start position:0%
so I can clarify so my one of my
 
04:34:06.349 --> 04:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
concerns about this bill is that it
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
might discourage new construction
 
04:34:11.189 --> 04:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
Although our housing market is hot
 
04:34:13.990 --> 04:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
enough that I'm I'm not sure if it would
 
04:34:16.269 --> 04:34:16.279 align:start position:0%
uh and I would assume that a house built
 
04:34:19.390 --> 04:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
under the 2018 code while it's not as
 
04:34:22.269 --> 04:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
efficient as the 20221 code would still
 
04:34:25.590 --> 04:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
be more efficient than
 
04:34:28.429 --> 04:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
whatever is already existing prior to
 
04:34:30.670 --> 04:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
the 2018 code absolutely for those homes
 
04:34:33.310 --> 04:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
that are built in 1950 1960 that you
 
04:34:35.910 --> 04:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
know still plenty of yes of course you
 
04:34:38.230 --> 04:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
know they're much more energy
 
04:34:40.629 --> 04:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
efficient we'll still
 
04:34:43.349 --> 04:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
build but you need to look at who you
 
04:34:45.470 --> 04:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
want as
 
04:34:47.629 --> 04:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
tenants because those costs are going to
 
04:34:51.750 --> 04:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
get passed on dollar for dollar to the
 
04:34:53.869 --> 04:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
tenant so those High rents are going to
 
04:34:54.910 --> 04:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
go a little bit
 
04:34:57.830 --> 04:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
higher those homes they're just now
 
04:34:57.840 --> 04:34:59.349 align:start position:0%
higher those homes they're just now
become

04:34:59.349 --> 04:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
become
 
04:35:01.590 --> 04:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
$20,000 more
 
04:35:06.390 --> 04:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
high so it won't stop the building but
 
04:35:08.510 --> 04:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
it'll stop who's coming to the state
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
it'll stop who lives in the state it'll
 
04:35:14.949 --> 04:35:14.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:17.349 --> 04:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
04:35:19.869 --> 04:35:19.879 align:start position:0%
Dar thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:35:22.990 --> 04:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
taking my call uh question uh you
 
04:35:25.390 --> 04:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned the ground Source heat pump as
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
being the most expensive item in the in
 
04:35:30.990 --> 04:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
the new code uh can you talk about that
 
04:35:33.390 --> 04:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
topic a little bit is it in the 18 code
 
04:35:36.750 --> 04:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
the 21 code and the 24 code and briefly
 
04:35:39.670 --> 04:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
what is it absolutely uh it's in the 24
 
04:35:42.590 --> 04:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
code and it's
 
04:35:44.269 --> 04:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
if I read
 
04:35:48.869 --> 04:35:48.879 align:start position:0%
correctly that it is a um geothermal
 
04:35:48.879 --> 04:35:50.150 align:start position:0%
correctly that it is a um geothermal
heat

04:35:50.150 --> 04:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
heat
 
04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:52.879 align:start position:0%
system so it would you know come through
 
04:35:56.150 --> 04:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
the Earth cool or heat and come back up
 
04:35:57.830 --> 04:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
and be recycle
 
04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
through follow up and that's mandated in
 
04:36:02.429 --> 04:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
the 24 code every every house will have
 
04:36:03.590 --> 04:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
to have a
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
geothermal from the research I did in
 
04:36:09.390 --> 04:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
the last 48 hours regarding
 
04:36:12.029 --> 04:36:12.039 align:start position:0%
this I'm gonna pause sir I don't want to
 
04:36:14.510 --> 04:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
misspeak I will find out and get you the
 
04:36:16.429 --> 04:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
correct answer because I don't want to
 
04:36:18.670 --> 04:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
mislead anyone thank
 
04:36:20.709 --> 04:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
you would you like me to get back to you
 
04:36:22.830 --> 04:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
sir please get back to the whole
 
04:36:25.310 --> 04:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
committee because I think having the
 
04:36:26.750 --> 04:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
question raised means we were all
 
04:36:28.310 --> 04:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
interested in the answer I'm on the
 
04:36:30.029 --> 04:36:30.039 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so I think you could bring
 
04:36:31.551 --> 04:36:31.561 align:start position:0%
it to the subcommittee and then it'll
 
04:36:33.189 --> 04:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
come back to the committee okay thank
 
04:36:36.709 --> 04:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you madam chair
 
04:36:39.750 --> 04:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
else sellers thank you madam
 
04:36:42.990 --> 04:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
chair so why do we have an energy code
 
04:36:44.551 --> 04:36:44.561 align:start position:0%
if we already have a building
 
04:36:52.150 --> 04:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
same sometimes a social
 
04:36:57.990 --> 04:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
construct of people placing political
 
04:37:02.910 --> 04:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
views into the public Arena drives
 
04:37:05.629 --> 04:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
agendas we have folks who want to go to
 
04:37:09.629 --> 04:37:09.639 align:start position:0%
Net Zero and green energy and um the
 
04:37:12.910 --> 04:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
whole Myriad of issues so so they you
 
04:37:15.070 --> 04:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
know send out the energy
 
04:37:17.189 --> 04:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
code separately
 
04:37:19.551 --> 04:37:19.561 align:start position:0%
so it is confusing that's why I took the
 
04:37:23.470 --> 04:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
time talk about the building code is
 
04:37:27.269 --> 04:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
2021 we're talking about the energy
 
04:37:30.070 --> 04:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
code I'm not speaking that just it gets
 
04:37:32.510 --> 04:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
really confusing to to some degree the
 
04:37:34.470 --> 04:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
energy code sets requirements and the
 
04:37:37.269 --> 04:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
building code gives the way to implement
 
04:37:39.789 --> 04:37:39.799 align:start position:0%
the requirements like insulation I think
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
is one of them yes ma'am
 
04:37:45.789 --> 04:37:45.799 align:start position:0%
um Mr M you said that according to
 
04:37:45.799 --> 04:37:46.869 align:start position:0%
um Mr M you said that according to
Senator

04:37:46.869 --> 04:37:46.879 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
04:37:51.869 --> 04:37:51.879 align:start position:0%
Shaheen the seven the 21 code Oppo
 
04:37:53.189 --> 04:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
imposed about
 
04:37:57.629 --> 04:37:57.639 align:start position:0%
$177,000 of costs above the 18 code and
 
04:38:01.230 --> 04:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
the payback was $500 a year yes okay
 
04:38:04.150 --> 04:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
well for the committee's delectation
 
04:38:07.310 --> 04:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
that's a 34-year payback plus however
 
04:38:09.990 --> 04:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
long it takes for the interest to borrow
 
04:38:13.109 --> 04:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
the money up front um which would
 
04:38:15.070 --> 04:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
approximately the same length of time in
 
04:38:17.390 --> 04:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
in my experience
 
04:38:21.269 --> 04:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
so um that's the interpretation of it
 
04:38:23.990 --> 04:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative reeze
 
04:38:26.109 --> 04:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciated your offering um
 
04:38:28.470 --> 04:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
the different numbers of debt that might
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
accumulate I'm deeply concerned about
 
04:38:32.390 --> 04:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing crisis here in
 
04:38:35.070 --> 04:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but I'm I'm wondering um
 
04:38:37.390 --> 04:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
if you are also prepared to offer any
 
04:38:40.269 --> 04:38:40.279 align:start position:0%
comments or numbers about the indirect
 
04:38:43.590 --> 04:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
cost born by everybody in the community
 
04:38:46.349 --> 04:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
um that results from inefficient use of
 
04:38:48.109 --> 04:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
energy and global warming and and
 
04:38:48.119 --> 04:38:51.429 align:start position:0%
energy and global warming and and
climate

04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:53.869 --> 04:38:53.879 align:start position:0%
change I think that would be describing
 
04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
the color
 
04:38:58.510 --> 04:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
blue up to
 
04:39:01.029 --> 04:39:01.039 align:start position:0%
interpretation so I I don't want to
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
guess because I have facts for you folks
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:10.349 --> 04:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
decisions any other
 
04:39:12.429 --> 04:39:12.439 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing n thank you
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
Mr mayber thank you madam chair
 
04:39:28.310 --> 04:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
Gage hello chairwoman Community uh thank
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my testimony today um I
 
04:39:35.470 --> 04:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
just had a couple thoughts about that I
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
read a quick article on New Hampshire
 
04:39:41.628 --> 04:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
Business Review Mar hop maian wrote that
 
04:39:45.070 --> 04:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
um these changes from 2018 to 2021
 
04:39:47.110 --> 04:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
expect to reduce uh to improve Energy
 
04:39:51.310 --> 04:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
Efficiency by 10% um
 
04:39:54.350 --> 04:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
and I think 177,000 sounds very high
 
04:39:55.830 --> 04:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
from what I've read about the estimates
 
04:39:58.270 --> 04:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
I've don't know but I've read three
 
04:40:02.310 --> 04:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
$3,000 so I think you should get some um
 
04:40:05.948 --> 04:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
more opinions about that um okay
 
04:40:12.510 --> 04:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire failed to update its bu
 
04:40:16.230 --> 04:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
building efficiency codes last year
 
04:40:18.030 --> 04:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
leaving the state behind our neighbors
 
04:40:20.670 --> 04:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
in new building efficiency requirements
 
04:40:22.350 --> 04:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
it's far cheaper to build Energy
 
04:40:23.868 --> 04:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
Efficiency into a building during the
 
04:40:25.830 --> 04:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
construction than to retrofit the
 
04:40:29.230 --> 04:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
improvements later I just retrofitted my
 
04:40:31.628 --> 04:40:31.638 align:start position:0%
own house which is 40 years old uh it
 
04:40:31.638 --> 04:40:32.510 align:start position:0%
own house which is 40 years old uh it
was

04:40:32.510 --> 04:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:40:36.230 --> 04:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
$99,000 to increase the insulation in
 
04:40:38.510 --> 04:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
the the ceilings of a couple places and
 
04:40:41.470 --> 04:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
in some walls uh and do other work um
 
04:40:42.990 --> 04:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
it's much easier for the homeowner if
 
04:40:46.150 --> 04:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
it's done ahead of time if buildings
 
04:40:47.788 --> 04:40:47.798 align:start position:0%
cost a little more to build so Builders
 
04:40:49.868 --> 04:40:49.878 align:start position:0%
don't like this change because their new
 
04:40:52.150 --> 04:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
buildings compete with existing stock
 
04:40:53.910 --> 04:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
however more energy efficient homes save
 
04:40:55.868 --> 04:40:55.878 align:start position:0%
homeowners many times over the initial
 
04:40:58.230 --> 04:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
construction cost in reducing energy
 
04:41:00.510 --> 04:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
spending and more efficient homes are
 
04:41:02.910 --> 04:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
more comfortable government intervention
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
is necessary to require Builders to
 
04:41:06.948 --> 04:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
build more efficient homes the New
 
04:41:08.628 --> 04:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy will benefit from
 
04:41:10.470 --> 04:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
doing so because it will let New
 
04:41:12.628 --> 04:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire homeowners save money they can
 
04:41:14.470 --> 04:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
spend on things other than autostate
 
04:41:20.310 --> 04:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:23.190 --> 04:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
fuels and finally while the payback is
 
04:41:25.030 --> 04:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
quick even under the current market
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
conditions the payback will be be even
 
04:41:29.190 --> 04:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
quicker when it is no longer free to
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
pollute and that is increasingly likely
 
04:41:33.868 --> 04:41:33.878 align:start position:0%
so it would be wise for New Hampshire to
 
04:41:36.030 --> 04:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
anticipate a future carbon price on
 
04:41:38.550 --> 04:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels which will drive higher
 
04:41:40.948 --> 04:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel prices carbon pricing is
 
04:41:43.070 --> 04:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
spreading around the world prices are
 
04:41:45.310 --> 04:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
rising and SE bams are putting
 
04:41:48.190 --> 04:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
increasing pressure on the US to price
 
04:41:50.990 --> 04:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
carbon the US is now the only developed
 
04:41:53.430 --> 04:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
country without a carbon price and other
 
04:41:55.510 --> 04:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
countries and regions are about to start
 
04:41:58.510 --> 04:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
charging us for our free pollution when
 
04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
we do trade with them Federal carbon
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
pricing is inevitable and New Hampshire
 
04:42:05.628 --> 04:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
should both prepare for it and tell
 
04:42:07.590 --> 04:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
Congress to do it with a good policy
 
04:42:09.670 --> 04:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
like carbon fee and dividend to protect
 
04:42:11.550 --> 04:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens and businesses
 
04:42:14.190 --> 04:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
and hold other countries accountable
 
04:42:22.270 --> 04:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:26.230 --> 04:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
handouts thank you for that and the U
 
04:42:28.030 --> 04:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
since it is going to subcommittee we'll
 
04:42:29.750 --> 04:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
have plenty of time to read this and you
 
04:42:32.230 --> 04:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
don't have to read it to us okay that
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
was all I'm done reading um so the hand
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
out so what I'm going to try to do is
 
04:42:40.750 --> 04:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
convince you that the US government is
 
04:42:42.670 --> 04:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
going to have to price carbon in the
 
04:42:44.708 --> 04:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
next 10
 
04:42:47.510 --> 04:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
years and the reason that it's important
 
04:42:49.910 --> 04:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
to convince you that that's happening is
 
04:42:52.430 --> 04:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
that if we continue using the 2018
 
04:42:54.670 --> 04:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
building codes and building more stock
 
04:42:58.788 --> 04:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
that is not 10% more efficient um what
 
04:43:01.590 --> 04:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
is a missed opportunity already is going
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
to become a bigger missed opportunity
 
04:43:06.910 --> 04:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
and hardship for families especially low
 
04:43:08.990 --> 04:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
and middle-income families um that are
 
04:43:11.708 --> 04:43:11.718 align:start position:0%
in new houses that are already obsolete
 
04:43:17.110 --> 04:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
as far as their building efficiency so
 
04:43:20.150 --> 04:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
um 75 countries and regions are pricing
 
04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
carbon that's about triple the number
 
04:43:26.788 --> 04:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
from a dozen years or so ago um prices
 
04:43:30.350 --> 04:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
are rising the EU price is around $70
 
04:43:33.948 --> 04:43:33.958 align:start position:0%
per ton of CO2 Canada is about the same
 
04:43:37.550 --> 04:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
and they're Rising um the
 
04:43:40.030 --> 04:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
International Panel on climate change
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
has a minimum carbon price that's
 
04:43:44.470 --> 04:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
required globally to have a chance to
 
04:43:47.510 --> 04:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
meet our climate goals the US price is
 
04:43:50.708 --> 04:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
still zero except for a few States um
 
04:43:53.590 --> 04:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
our major trading partners are on that
 
04:43:56.910 --> 04:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
Rising price path um they know what it
 
04:43:59.390 --> 04:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
is and they're getting to the point of a
 
04:44:01.590 --> 04:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
high enough price where it becomes a
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
trade problem for them and that's where
 
04:44:07.430 --> 04:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
cbm's carbon border adjustments come in
 
04:44:09.150 --> 04:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
so the European Union is the first
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
country that will Implement a cbam in
 
04:44:14.788 --> 04:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
2026 it actually was implemented two
 
04:44:18.948 --> 04:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
years ago on paper us exporters of
 
04:44:21.270 --> 04:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
energy intensive Goods steel cement
 
04:44:24.110 --> 04:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
aluminum Plastics have to calculate the
 
04:44:25.948 --> 04:44:25.958 align:start position:0%
embedded emissions in their products
 
04:44:28.270 --> 04:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
from producing it in the US so that when
 
04:44:31.708 --> 04:44:31.718 align:start position:0%
they sell it to the EU they calculate
 
04:44:33.948 --> 04:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
what their carbon footprint of that
 
04:44:37.070 --> 04:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
product is so that in 2026 when the EU
 
04:44:40.030 --> 04:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
starts charging their CBM they will pay
 
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
the EU on um when us goods go into the
 
04:44:48.750 --> 04:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
EU economy um the UK's CVM starts in
 
04:44:52.750 --> 04:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
2027 Japan's CBM starts in 2028
 
04:44:55.030 --> 04:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
Australia is looking at doing this and
 
04:44:59.310 --> 04:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
Canada is looking at doing this um so
 
04:45:01.750 --> 04:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
the US businesses don't have this on the
 
04:45:03.510 --> 04:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
horizon yet but when they start actually
 
04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
having to pay other countries and those
 
04:45:08.390 --> 04:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
prices are rising they will be subject
 
04:45:10.990 --> 04:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
to a competitive disadvantage as other
 
04:45:12.788 --> 04:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
countries are decarbonizing using the
 
04:45:16.750 --> 04:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
most effective methods and US carbon
 
04:45:19.868 --> 04:45:19.878 align:start position:0%
footprint products are not so New
 
04:45:21.910 --> 04:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be anticipating a
 
04:45:23.868 --> 04:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
federal carbon price a price on
 
04:45:25.948 --> 04:45:25.958 align:start position:0%
pollution um there's good ways to do
 
04:45:28.030 --> 04:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
this that are Revenue neutral and hold
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
other countries accountable but the
 
04:45:32.910 --> 04:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
thing that you guys thinking about this
 
04:45:36.190 --> 04:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
bill um should realize is that the
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
energy Market is changing why do
 
04:45:41.150 --> 04:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
efficiency codes and billing codes kind
 
04:45:43.470 --> 04:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
of mean you know why are they done
 
04:45:47.070 --> 04:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
together as one thing uh because that is
 
04:45:49.628 --> 04:45:49.638 align:start position:0%
an it's an integral to the building that
 
04:45:52.750 --> 04:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
people buy it's not just a frame and
 
04:45:54.990 --> 04:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
walls uh it's also how much it cost to
 
04:45:58.350 --> 04:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
operate um by increasing our Energy
 
04:46:01.628 --> 04:46:01.638 align:start position:0%
Efficiency in new buildings um we're
 
04:46:03.590 --> 04:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
anticipating changes in the energy
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
Market that we cannot avoid uh and all
 
04:46:08.590 --> 04:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
homeowners that buy these houses will
 
04:46:10.628 --> 04:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
will greatly appreciate it thank you can
 
04:46:12.670 --> 04:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
can I interpret your comments to say
 
04:46:14.990 --> 04:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
that you're expecting energy cost to
 
04:46:17.830 --> 04:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
rise significantly and is not considered
 
04:46:17.840 --> 04:46:19.270 align:start position:0%
rise significantly and is not considered
in

04:46:19.270 --> 04:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:46:22.470 --> 04:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
other other issues that's correct if you
 
04:46:25.310 --> 04:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
look at the single page sheet uh one of
 
04:46:27.750 --> 04:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
the sides has statements from all the
 
04:46:31.110 --> 04:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
major fossil fuel um producers they all
 
04:46:33.510 --> 04:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
agree climate change from their product
 
04:46:35.708 --> 04:46:35.718 align:start position:0%
is happening they all agree that carbon
 
04:46:38.670 --> 04:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
pricing is the The Logical market-based
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
approach to solve it and this is
 
04:46:42.910 --> 04:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
happening on a quarter of all the fossil
 
04:46:44.708 --> 04:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
fuels that are sold in the world and
 
04:46:48.510 --> 04:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
it's spreading so yes I so we can do it
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
with carbon fee and dividend returning
 
04:46:51.390 --> 04:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
the money collected from fossil fuel
 
04:46:53.430 --> 04:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
producers so people come out ahead was
 
04:46:55.470 --> 04:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
the an thank you the answer is yes does
 
04:46:57.430 --> 04:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else have questions repr of
 
04:47:00.310 --> 04:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you for taking my question
 
04:47:02.390 --> 04:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh so when you were initially talking
 
04:47:03.470 --> 04:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
about some of the upgrades that you
 
04:47:05.310 --> 04:47:05.320 align:start position:0%
performed on your home you said that
 
04:47:08.548 --> 04:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
$9,000 uh was spent on your 40-year home
 
04:47:12.350 --> 04:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
what was the original cost of that home
 
04:47:13.788 --> 04:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
uh I bought it
 
04:47:16.670 --> 04:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
used well yes but how much did you
 
04:47:20.548 --> 04:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
pay 187,000 I think all right wonderful
 
04:47:22.230 --> 04:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh could I have follow follow up all
 
04:47:24.150 --> 04:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
right wonderful and how much do you
 
04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
believe you have made back each year uh
 
04:47:29.070 --> 04:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
due to these
 
04:47:31.708 --> 04:47:31.718 align:start position:0%
upgrades well I just made them this
 
04:47:34.590 --> 04:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
Summer uh so there hasn't been much time
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
for payback except the upstairs is 5°
 
04:47:41.628 --> 04:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
warmer than it was before with the heat
 
04:47:46.150 --> 04:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
set in the same level um I pulled out my
 
04:47:49.788 --> 04:47:49.798 align:start position:0%
heating of water and put in a heat pump
 
04:47:52.788 --> 04:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
water system in the basement um I
 
04:47:54.350 --> 04:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
constantly run a dehumidifier in the
 
04:47:57.310 --> 04:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
basement all summer long um to keep it
 
04:48:00.030 --> 04:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
dry this is automatic dehumidification
 
04:48:03.548 --> 04:48:03.558 align:start position:0%
dehumid dehumidification in the
 
04:48:05.910 --> 04:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
summertime uh as it operates it
 
04:48:07.670 --> 04:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
naturally pulls water out of the air as
 
04:48:10.310 --> 04:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's heating the water so it's taking
 
04:48:11.548 --> 04:48:11.558 align:start position:0%
care of
 
04:48:14.830 --> 04:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
um I won't know the cost what the the
 
04:48:17.548 --> 04:48:17.558 align:start position:0%
guy that uh installed the whole system
 
04:48:19.628 --> 04:48:19.638 align:start position:0%
and did I replaced my furnace too that
 
04:48:22.030 --> 04:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
broke too it was a expensive year last
 
04:48:25.590 --> 04:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
year um thought I would be burning 50%
 
04:48:28.230 --> 04:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
less oil and the heating of the water
 
04:48:29.948 --> 04:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
would be much cheaper than it was when I
 
04:48:32.390 --> 04:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
was using oil to heat it um so my home
 
04:48:33.350 --> 04:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
is more
 
04:48:35.590 --> 04:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable I wish the house had been
 
04:48:38.270 --> 04:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
built to the standards that I am trying
 
04:48:41.470 --> 04:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
now I can't get it to to that but I I
 
04:48:44.510 --> 04:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
hit the most important parts it's a lot
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of hassle you have to deal
 
04:48:48.788 --> 04:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
with contractors yourself these guys are
 
04:48:50.030 --> 04:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
brilliant they know how to build
 
04:48:52.830 --> 04:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
buildings I had to learn heating systems
 
04:48:54.830 --> 04:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
and vapor barriers and we did blower
 
04:48:56.670 --> 04:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
tests and like how much do I want to
 
04:49:00.548 --> 04:49:00.558 align:start position:0%
spend versus um the the US agencies that
 
04:49:03.310 --> 04:49:03.320 align:start position:0%
made these 2021 building efficiency
 
04:49:05.310 --> 04:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
standards looked at cost and
 
04:49:07.030 --> 04:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
availability of what it what these
 
04:49:09.350 --> 04:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
standards would do to the building stock
 
04:49:11.310 --> 04:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:49:13.510 --> 04:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
it didn't make a difference they they
 
04:49:15.430 --> 04:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
deter you know part of developing the
 
04:49:18.110 --> 04:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
standard is to not break things and and
 
04:49:20.030 --> 04:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
so that calculation has been done and I
 
04:49:21.470 --> 04:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
believe other states around us are
 
04:49:23.548 --> 04:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
already using these codes um and they
 
04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
don't seem to be having problems we do
 
04:49:27.990 --> 04:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
seem to be the donut hole in New England
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
as far as Energy Efficiency goes and
 
04:49:33.590 --> 04:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
people moving into the state will think
 
04:49:36.510 --> 04:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
that do you want to live in a a cheap to
 
04:49:38.708 --> 04:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
to operate house that's comfortable in
 
04:49:41.230 --> 04:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont or Maine or massachusett sits or
 
04:49:42.990 --> 04:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
do you want to go into New Hampshire and
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
you're kind of on their own because
 
04:49:47.070 --> 04:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
their efficiency codes are out of date
 
04:49:49.470 --> 04:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
and um you know you might save a couple
 
04:49:51.030 --> 04:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
bucks when you buy the house but you're
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
going to pay uh year after year um for
 
04:49:54.240 --> 04:49:55.190 align:start position:0%
going to pay uh year after year um for
that

04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:57.788 --> 04:49:57.798 align:start position:0%
luxury all right thank you so
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
much other questions thank you very much
 
04:50:16.590 --> 04:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
04:50:20.110 --> 04:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Alex kbis I'm with
 
04:50:22.350 --> 04:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
the associated general contractors of
 
04:50:24.590 --> 04:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I replaced Gary Abbott
 
04:50:26.990 --> 04:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
this summer so I'm about six months in
 
04:50:29.948 --> 04:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
the new role so please be gentle with me
 
04:50:31.910 --> 04:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually my first Hearing in
 
04:50:34.750 --> 04:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
the new uh in the new position we are
 
04:50:36.910 --> 04:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to this legislation and I just
 
04:50:38.750 --> 04:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
want to remind the committee and it's
 
04:50:40.030 --> 04:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
kind of been said before but I don't
 
04:50:42.150 --> 04:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
know how explicit listed it's been in
 
04:50:45.390 --> 04:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
2024 House Bill 1059 which I've handed
 
04:50:47.230 --> 04:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
out handed out the committee report in
 
04:50:49.910 --> 04:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
the docket this committee voted 20 to
 
04:50:53.430 --> 04:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
zero to not adopt the 2021 energy code
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
that was last year and as you can see
 
04:50:57.708 --> 04:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
it's in the committee report and I
 
04:50:59.910 --> 04:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
looked up the vote the building code
 
04:51:03.030 --> 04:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
review board voted 9 to4 to not adopt
 
04:51:06.948 --> 04:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
the 2021 energy code last year in 2024
 
04:51:09.430 --> 04:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
so this committee and the experts on the
 
04:51:12.548 --> 04:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
building code review committee rejected
 
04:51:15.150 --> 04:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
the 2021 building code a very short time
 
04:51:19.830 --> 04:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
ago uh Governor cunu signed House Bill
 
04:51:22.868 --> 04:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
1059 in August of last year so not that
 
04:51:24.990 --> 04:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
long ago so we're already we're already
 
04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
back again I don't know really what's
 
04:51:28.510 --> 04:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
changed all that much in the last few
 
04:51:30.910 --> 04:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
months but but here we are I also handed
 
04:51:33.230 --> 04:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
out an article from the conquered
 
04:51:35.910 --> 04:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
monitor that talks about a housing
 
04:51:38.830 --> 04:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
development in the South End of conquer
 
04:51:41.628 --> 04:51:41.638 align:start position:0%
and it was a multiphas
 
04:51:43.590 --> 04:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh apartment building you can see if you
 
04:51:46.788 --> 04:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
read the article the rents are very uh
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
affordable for one in two-bedroom homes
 
04:51:51.070 --> 04:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
and the developer talks about in the
 
04:51:53.310 --> 04:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
article High interest rates and high
 
04:51:56.910 --> 04:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
construction costs have put that the
 
04:51:59.590 --> 04:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
additional phases of that project in
 
04:52:01.190 --> 04:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy because he's saying the
 
04:52:03.230 --> 04:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
construction costs are too high and a
 
04:52:05.390 --> 04:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
bill like this has the potential I think
 
04:52:07.310 --> 04:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
significant potential to add
 
04:52:09.070 --> 04:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
construction costs and put some of these
 
04:52:12.868 --> 04:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
important housing projects at risk uh as
 
04:52:14.390 --> 04:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
I said the the building code Review
 
04:52:17.030 --> 04:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
Committee really they're the experts
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
that that um should be reviewing these
 
04:52:21.548 --> 04:52:21.558 align:start position:0%
Bill these uh these types of bills
 
04:52:23.310 --> 04:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
before they go to the legislature we
 
04:52:24.868 --> 04:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
would certainly urge the committee to
 
04:52:27.868 --> 04:52:27.878 align:start position:0%
not do anything in in the 2025 session
 
04:52:29.868 --> 04:52:29.878 align:start position:0%
and wait until the review is done in
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
June perhaps we can look at doing
 
04:52:33.190 --> 04:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
something in
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
2026 uh but just as a reminder that the
 
04:52:38.670 --> 04:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
jump to the 2018 codes was was a pretty
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
significant jump
 
04:52:43.708 --> 04:52:43.718 align:start position:0%
in terms of the types of requirements
 
04:52:47.310 --> 04:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
that were put on Builders uh these tests
 
04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
as you heard can cost thousands of
 
04:52:50.788 --> 04:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
dollars the upgrades can cost thousands
 
04:52:52.948 --> 04:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
of dollars and I agree with everything
 
04:52:55.590 --> 04:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
that the home builder said these costs
 
04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
are just going to get passed on to the
 
04:52:59.750 --> 04:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
users of these buildings whether they're
 
04:53:02.750 --> 04:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
in in rent or owning situations uh it
 
04:53:06.190 --> 04:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
can take decades to recoup the cost of
 
04:53:08.070 --> 04:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
the initial investment and we want the
 
04:53:10.990 --> 04:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
consumers to have the choice uh
 
04:53:12.868 --> 04:53:12.878 align:start position:0%
we we'll build the Taj Mahal if that's
 
04:53:15.270 --> 04:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
what people want but it may not be
 
04:53:16.948 --> 04:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
affordable for everyone so we want
 
04:53:18.470 --> 04:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
people to have the choice if you want a
 
04:53:22.270 --> 04:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
significantly energy efficient home or
 
04:53:24.230 --> 04:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
commercial building we will we will
 
04:53:26.310 --> 04:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
build to that if you want something that
 
04:53:27.990 --> 04:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
that just meets the code or or somewhere
 
04:53:30.548 --> 04:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
in between we want to work with the
 
04:53:32.910 --> 04:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
individuals that purchase these these
 
04:53:35.670 --> 04:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
buildings um so that that's really all I
 
04:53:37.230 --> 04:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
have to say I'm happy to provide my
 
04:53:38.830 --> 04:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
written testimony but again we would
 
04:53:42.510 --> 04:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
just urge from the commercial side uh
 
04:53:44.350 --> 04:53:44.360 align:start position:0%
let let's let the building code Review
 
04:53:45.750 --> 04:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
Committee complete its work which you
 
04:53:47.830 --> 04:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
heard is not going to be done until June
 
04:53:49.470 --> 04:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
and perhaps we could look at some kind
 
04:53:52.110 --> 04:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
of compromise where we adopt pieces of
 
04:53:54.990 --> 04:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
21 and 24 but we just don't think this
 
04:53:57.230 --> 04:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
bill is ready for for prime time happy
 
04:53:59.470 --> 04:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
to participate in the subcommittee I'm
 
04:54:01.110 --> 04:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
even happy to see if I can get a
 
04:54:03.430 --> 04:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
commercial builder at the at the meeting
 
04:54:06.150 --> 04:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
to see there's more questions in detail
 
04:54:08.310 --> 04:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to ask that individual
 
04:54:09.708 --> 04:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to try to do that if you think
 
04:54:12.150 --> 04:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's helpful to
 
04:54:14.070 --> 04:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
04:54:17.110 --> 04:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
you are questions from the
 
04:54:19.350 --> 04:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
committee all right seeing none thank
 
04:54:21.750 --> 04:54:21.760 align:start position:0%

beamus we're
 
04:54:32.270 --> 04:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
gonna together I believe with Bruce um
 
04:54:35.150 --> 04:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
okay you're Bruce butrick yes okay thank
 
04:54:38.270 --> 04:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you that'll
 
04:54:42.030 --> 04:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh else spe it up
 
04:54:51.708 --> 04:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:54.430 --> 04:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
meant thank you madam chair committee

members my name is Bruce butrick I live
 
04:54:57.480 --> 04:54:58.270 align:start position:0%
members my name is Bruce butrick I live
in

04:54:58.270 --> 04:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:55:01.430 --> 04:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
Goffstown I'm here as a resident but
 
04:55:05.548 --> 04:55:05.558 align:start position:0%
also because I belong to a engineering
 
04:55:05.558 --> 04:55:07.270 align:start position:0%
also because I belong to a engineering
industry

04:55:07.270 --> 04:55:07.280 align:start position:0%

04:55:15.350 --> 04:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
Engineers it's
 
04:55:17.708 --> 04:55:17.718 align:start position:0%
International and its memberships about
 
04:55:22.030 --> 04:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
55,000 people I'm not representing them
 
04:55:24.990 --> 04:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
but I use their standards one of their
 
04:55:29.350 --> 04:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
standards being the standard aashray
 
04:55:32.670 --> 04:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
90.1 which is the energy code primarily
 
04:55:35.590 --> 04:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
in the commercial function of it but
 
04:55:37.708 --> 04:55:37.718 align:start position:0%
there are some residential elements of
 
04:55:41.150 --> 04:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
that as well also
 
04:55:43.830 --> 04:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
there's the international energy
 
04:55:47.110 --> 04:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
conservation code the
 
04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
iecc which is um produced by the
 
04:55:54.788 --> 04:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
International Code Council which is a
 
04:55:57.270 --> 04:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
big umbrella of all the building codes
 
04:55:58.628 --> 04:55:58.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to say building codes
 
04:56:01.070 --> 04:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
meaning Plumbing electrical well not
 
04:56:03.868 --> 04:56:03.878 align:start position:0%
electrical um the mechanical
 
04:56:07.628 --> 04:56:07.638 align:start position:0%
hvc um building and some fire codes so
 
04:56:09.990 --> 04:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's a very convoluted thing bucket to
 
04:56:12.788 --> 04:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
put in as building codes but I'll give
 
04:56:15.110 --> 04:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
you a little background of
 
04:56:20.030 --> 04:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
myself um I'm retired but I started out
 
04:56:22.310 --> 04:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
after college working for mechanical
 
04:56:25.750 --> 04:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
engineering firm in Boston and with that
 
04:56:28.110 --> 04:56:28.120 align:start position:0%
entailed working with mechanical codes
 
04:56:31.110 --> 04:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
fire protection and building
 
04:56:34.590 --> 04:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
codes as well as the ashray being a
 
04:56:36.070 --> 04:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
function having standards for
 
04:56:36.080 --> 04:56:38.270 align:start position:0%
function having standards for
refrigeration

04:56:38.270 --> 04:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
refrigeration
 
04:56:42.070 --> 04:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
whatever um after several years I went
 
04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
and went to
 
04:56:46.510 --> 04:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
the contractor's side as project manager
 
04:56:49.390 --> 04:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
for a mechanical contractor in
 
04:56:51.708 --> 04:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
Manchester after that I went to the dark
 
04:56:54.708 --> 04:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
side and became a building inspector
 
04:56:57.230 --> 04:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
specifically a mechanical inspector city
 
04:57:00.350 --> 04:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
of nashar for 15 years plus that was
 
04:57:03.628 --> 04:57:03.638 align:start position:0%
primarily gas piping and
 
04:57:07.390 --> 04:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
HVAC and most recently I morphed into a
 
04:57:09.350 --> 04:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
land use zoning administrator and
 
04:57:12.788 --> 04:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:16.190 --> 04:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
with that I'll introduce Paul in a bit
 
04:57:19.110 --> 04:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to work on the elements of the
 
04:57:22.110 --> 04:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
policy of energy codes and the
 
04:57:26.190 --> 04:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
benefits and I wanted to alert or
 
04:57:28.430 --> 04:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
reference the handout the first page I
 
04:57:30.948 --> 04:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
went online to see what the testimony
 
04:57:35.030 --> 04:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
was and as of 10 o'clock there were 45
 
04:57:37.590 --> 04:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
that supported this bill six that
 
04:57:40.750 --> 04:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
opposed it so there is some good
 
04:57:45.070 --> 04:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
support for this at least addressing the
 
04:57:48.910 --> 04:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
energy code and possibility of adopting
 
04:57:48.920 --> 04:57:50.470 align:start position:0%
energy code and possibility of adopting
that

04:57:50.470 --> 04:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:57:53.948 --> 04:57:53.958 align:start position:0%
um as I said the energy code function
 
04:57:57.150 --> 04:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
from ashray is collaborated with the ICC
 
04:58:00.070 --> 04:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
and it becomes the iecc international
 
04:58:02.868 --> 04:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
energy code conservation code which has
 
04:58:04.430 --> 04:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
a residential element as well as the
 
04:58:04.440 --> 04:58:06.670 align:start position:0%
a residential element as well as the
commercial

04:58:06.670 --> 04:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
04:58:10.830 --> 04:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
element so my speech is the second
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
handout and basically it's the benefits
 
04:58:15.390 --> 04:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
of adopting energy
 
04:58:17.590 --> 04:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
codes as we know energy codes are
 
04:58:18.868 --> 04:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
regulatory I'm not going to read the
 
04:58:20.548 --> 04:58:20.558 align:start position:0%
whole thing just the highlights so you
 
04:58:24.628 --> 04:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
spared that energy codes are regulatory
 
04:58:27.670 --> 04:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
standards um basically the uh energies
 
04:58:29.910 --> 04:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
to improve the energy code is to prove
 
04:58:32.350 --> 04:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency of buildings and
 
04:58:34.548 --> 04:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
thereby reducing the energy consumption
 
04:58:37.190 --> 04:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
the demand and the greenhouse gas
 
04:58:40.628 --> 04:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
emissions whatever simply put
 
04:58:42.670 --> 04:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
it's the worst house you can legally
 
04:58:44.830 --> 04:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
build when you have a building code
 
04:58:47.628 --> 04:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
energy code plumbing code it's the floor
 
04:58:50.788 --> 04:58:50.798 align:start position:0%
level it's a D minus it's the minimum
 
04:58:53.070 --> 04:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
minimum that's all we're asking for is
 
04:58:56.110 --> 04:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
that minimum standard to have to build
 
04:58:58.868 --> 04:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
to to achieve the benefits of all the
 
04:59:01.390 --> 04:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
building codes and the inry codes so
 
04:59:02.910 --> 04:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
what's what are the benefits the
 
04:59:05.070 --> 04:59:05.080 align:start position:0%
environmental benefits reduction of
 
04:59:07.310 --> 04:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases by setting Energy
 
04:59:09.510 --> 04:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
Efficiency standards for buildings these
 
04:59:12.110 --> 04:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
codes Ure that less energy is consumed
 
04:59:14.670 --> 04:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
for heating cooling lighting and other
 
04:59:14.680 --> 04:59:15.830 align:start position:0%
for heating cooling lighting and other
operational

04:59:15.830 --> 04:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
operational
 
04:59:18.990 --> 04:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
needs this in turn leads to a decrease
 
04:59:20.670 --> 04:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
in the burning of fossil
 
04:59:24.190 --> 04:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
fuels conservation of Natural Resources
 
04:59:25.990 --> 04:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
the implementation of energy codes help
 
04:59:28.270 --> 04:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
conserve natural resources by decreasing
 
04:59:31.590 --> 04:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
the demand for energy improved air
 
04:59:34.548 --> 04:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
quality lower energy consumption the
 
04:59:36.910 --> 04:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
demand means there's fewer emissions
 
04:59:39.310 --> 04:59:39.320 align:start position:0%
from the power plants which in turn
 
04:59:40.990 --> 04:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
results in clean cleer
 
04:59:44.708 --> 04:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
air the economic benefits the cost
 
04:59:47.190 --> 04:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
savings energy efficient buildings
 
04:59:50.190 --> 04:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
require less energy to operate which
 
04:59:53.628 --> 04:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
translate into lower utility builds from
 
04:59:56.670 --> 04:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
a mechanical designer standpoint the
 
04:59:59.070 --> 04:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
tight energy efficient building I didn't
 
05:00:03.590 --> 05:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
have to provide a bigger heating plant
 
05:00:06.310 --> 05:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
it was reduced for that heat loss for
 
05:00:07.750 --> 05:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
the load of the building I didn't have
 
05:00:09.948 --> 05:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
to provide as large a mechanical system
 
05:00:12.190 --> 05:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
systems because of that efficient
 
05:00:12.200 --> 05:00:13.548 align:start position:0%
systems because of that efficient
building

05:00:13.548 --> 05:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
building
 
05:00:16.470 --> 05:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
shell The increased energy security we
 
05:00:18.750 --> 05:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
would like to have energy independence
 
05:00:20.350 --> 05:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
energy efficient buildings help
 
05:00:23.548 --> 05:00:23.558 align:start position:0%
stabilize the energy grid by decreasing
 
05:00:25.430 --> 05:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
the peak demand which can prevent
 
05:00:27.788 --> 05:00:27.798 align:start position:0%
blackouts reduce the need for costly
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure upgrades and then the
 
05:00:30.400 --> 05:00:32.110 align:start position:0%
infrastructure upgrades and then the
societal

05:00:32.110 --> 05:00:32.120 align:start position:0%
societal
 
05:00:34.868 --> 05:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
benefits it enhanced the comfort and
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
well-being we improved the insulation
 
05:00:39.548 --> 05:00:39.558 align:start position:0%
the ventilation and temperature control
 
05:00:39.558 --> 05:00:40.470 align:start position:0%
the ventilation and temperature control
system

05:00:40.470 --> 05:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:00:42.830 --> 05:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
it ensures that the indoor spaces are
 
05:00:44.910 --> 05:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
kept at optimal conditions regardless of
 
05:00:46.910 --> 05:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
the external weather conditions today's
 
05:00:48.868 --> 05:00:48.878 align:start position:0%
a great
 
05:00:52.270 --> 05:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
example and the benefits that taxpayer
 
05:00:53.788 --> 05:00:53.798 align:start position:0%
the energy code ensures that all
 
05:00:55.750 --> 05:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
buildings especially State and municipal
 
05:00:58.310 --> 05:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
buildings that are built and owned that
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
they meet minimum energy performance
 
05:01:02.470 --> 05:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
standards this directly benefits the
 
05:01:04.670 --> 05:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers as energy efficient buildings
 
05:01:07.430 --> 05:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
are less costly to
 
05:01:10.590 --> 05:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
operate so in conclusion
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
the adoption and implementation of
 
05:01:14.548 --> 05:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
energy codes should be a priority for
 
05:01:18.150 --> 05:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
policy makers the industry stakeholders
 
05:01:20.590 --> 05:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
and the general public alike as we
 
05:01:22.510 --> 05:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
collectively strive towards a more
 
05:01:25.390 --> 05:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
energy efficient
 
05:01:29.230 --> 05:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
World um so I basically did
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
the benefits of the energy code Paul's
 
05:01:34.590 --> 05:01:34.600 align:start position:0%
the numbers guy he's the real
 
05:01:37.708 --> 05:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
engineer and I'm going to let Paul there
 
05:01:39.430 --> 05:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
was one a question that I'm going to
 
05:01:41.350 --> 05:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
answer because I did get involved with
 
05:01:45.470 --> 05:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
codes codes adoptions whatever when the
 
05:01:47.030 --> 05:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
building codes and the energy codes
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
plumbing codes change from one edition
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
to another Edition say the 18 to
 
05:01:56.430 --> 05:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
21 I'm going to say the mother the um
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
the organizers that are writing these
 
05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
they will do substantial changes from
 
05:02:04.310 --> 05:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
that version to another version or us as
 
05:02:06.628 --> 05:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
inspectors we' know oh my gosh this this
 
05:02:08.470 --> 05:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
changed there a cheat sheet you know
 
05:02:10.670 --> 05:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
two-page whatever what changed from that
 
05:02:13.390 --> 05:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
code to that code so we'd know that okay
 
05:02:14.788 --> 05:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
we've got to get into a new program of
 
05:02:18.628 --> 05:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
the new code they never had the numbers
 
05:02:20.948 --> 05:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
of how much is that incremental cost
 
05:02:23.548 --> 05:02:23.558 align:start position:0%
going to do to incur those
 
05:02:27.230 --> 05:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
changes um other than that that's
 
05:02:30.948 --> 05:02:30.958 align:start position:0%
basically and again the number of codes
 
05:02:33.230 --> 05:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
the international codes were kind of
 
05:02:34.750 --> 05:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
like a family of codes and that's why
 
05:02:36.590 --> 05:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
they rolled them into the plumbing code
 
05:02:38.150 --> 05:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
the mechanic code the fire code and the
 
05:02:40.190 --> 05:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
building code because sometimes s in the
 
05:02:44.910 --> 05:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
building code it said you can um design
 
05:02:48.548 --> 05:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
fabricate the egress exits in accordance
 
05:02:50.150 --> 05:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
to the fire code and then make your
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
reference to another code that
 
05:02:55.948 --> 05:02:55.958 align:start position:0%
complements that code that you're on so
 
05:02:57.990 --> 05:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
if you happen to break them apart from
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
the 21 to an 18 it can get disjointed
 
05:03:05.270 --> 05:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't meld well and that's one
 
05:03:07.868 --> 05:03:07.878 align:start position:0%
of my concerns of having to stay on the
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
18 is we got left by behind we may not
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
mesh well with the 21s which are
 
05:03:13.920 --> 05:03:15.548 align:start position:0%
mesh well with the 21s which are
currently

05:03:15.548 --> 05:03:15.558 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:03:18.430 --> 05:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
adopted so I think I'm finished with my
 
05:03:21.190 --> 05:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
spu and I'm going to go to the
 
05:03:25.030 --> 05:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
numbers uh thank you madam chair for
 
05:03:27.230 --> 05:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
having both of us here and members of
 
05:03:28.910 --> 05:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Paul
 
05:03:31.788 --> 05:03:31.798 align:start position:0%
beamus I um am an engineer mechanical
 
05:03:33.350 --> 05:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
engineer undergrad University of New
 
05:03:34.948 --> 05:03:34.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire graduate school electrical
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
engineering at North Eastern University
 
05:03:40.830 --> 05:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
and uh also an MBA I I own a company
 
05:03:42.548 --> 05:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
called applied math modeling we do
 
05:03:44.070 --> 05:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
mathematical modeling for high
 
05:03:46.548 --> 05:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
performance data centers so I'm a
 
05:03:48.230 --> 05:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
building scientist and involved with
 
05:03:50.708 --> 05:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
building science uh most of my adult
 
05:03:54.030 --> 05:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
life I wanted to uh testify today that
 
05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
the in favor of this bill h96 the 2021
 
05:03:59.470 --> 05:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
codes are quite important for a number
 
05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
of reasons Bruce mentioned a number of
 
05:04:04.190 --> 05:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
these including of course Energy
 
05:04:06.868 --> 05:04:06.878 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and cost savings there's
 
05:04:09.230 --> 05:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
another big one that uh we often don't
 
05:04:12.548 --> 05:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
talk about human health uh if you have a
 
05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
building that has proper insulation and
 
05:04:18.270 --> 05:04:18.280 align:start position:0%
a proper Vapor Barrier which are the two
 
05:04:20.948 --> 05:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
key things in the 2021 code compared to
 
05:04:24.230 --> 05:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
the 2018 code you have a home that is
 
05:04:26.590 --> 05:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
much more comfortable and you have
 
05:04:29.310 --> 05:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
humans who are much healthier this is
 
05:04:32.030 --> 05:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
because mostly The Vapor Barrier keeps
 
05:04:34.590 --> 05:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
humidity both in and out in the winter
 
05:04:38.430 --> 05:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
time like today it keeps humidity in so
 
05:04:41.230 --> 05:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
that you can operate in the 40 to 60%
 
05:04:43.230 --> 05:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
relative humidity range that is required
 
05:04:46.150 --> 05:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
to make humans healthy if you drop below
 
05:04:49.788 --> 05:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
40% which a leaky building will do uh
 
05:04:51.390 --> 05:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
that will cause problems with your
 
05:04:53.548 --> 05:04:53.558 align:start position:0%
immune system because it dries out the
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
silica in your upper respiratory system
 
05:04:57.590 --> 05:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
that is used to defend yourself against
 
05:05:00.750 --> 05:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
Airborne pathogens in addition uh
 
05:05:02.830 --> 05:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
Airborne pathogens generally if the
 
05:05:05.030 --> 05:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
humidity is high will be wet and will
 
05:05:07.750 --> 05:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
fall to the ground when it's dry they
 
05:05:10.150 --> 05:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
don't they float in the atmosphere here
 
05:05:12.708 --> 05:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
and you can ingest them and become sick
 
05:05:16.070 --> 05:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
this is a leading cause of Airborne
 
05:05:18.868 --> 05:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
transmission uh from diseases ranging
 
05:05:21.708 --> 05:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
from sinful influenza to covid-19 to the
 
05:05:24.670 --> 05:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
measles to the common flu indoor air
 
05:05:28.030 --> 05:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
quality is important from not just a
 
05:05:30.750 --> 05:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
quality of environment and comfort point
 
05:05:32.548 --> 05:05:32.558 align:start position:0%
of view it is important from a human
 
05:05:33.708 --> 05:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
health point of
 
05:05:36.110 --> 05:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
view now just speaking to the issue of
 
05:05:38.190 --> 05:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
cost there's been a lot of discussion
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
about high cost
 
05:05:42.150 --> 05:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
the studies that have been done by the
 
05:05:43.830 --> 05:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
depart on behalf of the Department of
 
05:05:46.350 --> 05:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
energy by the Pacific National Northwest
 
05:05:49.788 --> 05:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
lab which is one of the best labs in the
 
05:05:51.510 --> 05:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
country I know them I've worked with
 
05:05:53.030 --> 05:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
them they've been my customer a number
 
05:05:55.750 --> 05:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
of times indicates the cost to go from
 
05:06:00.350 --> 05:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
the 2018 code to the 2021 code is
 
05:06:03.270 --> 05:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
$2,350 it's not a big number it's a
 
05:06:05.628 --> 05:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
small number
 
05:06:08.628 --> 05:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
$2,300 uh furthermore uh when you go to
 
05:06:11.430 --> 05:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
the 2021 code you have as Bruce pointed
 
05:06:14.990 --> 05:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
out a smaller footprint of heating and
 
05:06:17.708 --> 05:06:17.718 align:start position:0%
cooling which means you can reduce the
 
05:06:21.150 --> 05:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
size of your heating and cooling system
 
05:06:23.590 --> 05:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
an example of this is a new home I went
 
05:06:26.430 --> 05:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
and visited in Maine who did conform to
 
05:06:29.230 --> 05:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
the 2021 codes to give you an example
 
05:06:31.270 --> 05:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
the home is equivalent to approximately
 
05:06:34.670 --> 05:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
my size of my home about 2600 Square ft
 
05:06:37.270 --> 05:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
a modest home they were heating it with
 
05:06:39.628 --> 05:06:39.638 align:start position:0%
33,000 BTUs
 
05:06:43.708 --> 05:06:43.718 align:start position:0%
a mine takes 100,000 factor of three
 
05:06:46.670 --> 05:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
more to heat and cool my home compared
 
05:06:48.670 --> 05:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
to theirs because it was built to the
 
05:06:48.680 --> 05:06:50.190 align:start position:0%
to theirs because it was built to the
2021

05:06:50.190 --> 05:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
2021
 
05:06:54.548 --> 05:06:54.558 align:start position:0%
standards so the studies that uh are
 
05:06:57.788 --> 05:06:57.798 align:start position:0%
credible suggest a savings as stated by
 
05:06:59.830 --> 05:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
John of uh
 
05:07:02.788 --> 05:07:02.798 align:start position:0%
$531 a year in average cost savings for
 
05:07:05.270 --> 05:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
this geography but that's on an
 
05:07:08.510 --> 05:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
investment of $2,300 not
 
05:07:12.110 --> 05:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
$20,000 $2,300 we're talking here
 
05:07:13.830 --> 05:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
predominantly about the amount of
 
05:07:16.548 --> 05:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
insulation the ceiling goes to R50 the
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
walls go to
 
05:07:21.910 --> 05:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
R30 the subfloor gets insulated as well
 
05:07:23.868 --> 05:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
once you have your building insulated it
 
05:07:26.628 --> 05:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
will sustain its temperature so that on
 
05:07:28.628 --> 05:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
a cold night like last night we went
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
through you get up in the morning and
 
05:07:33.110 --> 05:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
your home is or office or commercial
 
05:07:35.070 --> 05:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
building is roughly the same temperature
 
05:07:38.030 --> 05:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
as it was when you left because it rides
 
05:07:39.868 --> 05:07:39.878 align:start position:0%
it's called a thermal ride the ability
 
05:07:42.030 --> 05:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
to ride through the night because it has
 
05:07:44.788 --> 05:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
mass the mass has temperature it holds
 
05:07:46.670 --> 05:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
on to it because it's not dumping it to
 
05:07:46.680 --> 05:07:47.510 align:start position:0%
on to it because it's not dumping it to
the

05:07:47.510 --> 05:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:07:49.750 --> 05:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
atmosphere I think many of us woke up
 
05:07:53.590 --> 05:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
today to a cool environment in our homes
 
05:07:55.990 --> 05:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh if it wasn't cold in it it's because
 
05:07:57.708 --> 05:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
you were burning a lot of probably
 
05:08:00.590 --> 05:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel and it was probably cold in
 
05:08:03.910 --> 05:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
certain sections conforming to the 2021
 
05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
code would eliminate that the home would
 
05:08:08.390 --> 05:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
have a constant uniform temperature
 
05:08:11.830 --> 05:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
throughout it this is very important for
 
05:08:14.750 --> 05:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
not only human health but Energy
 
05:08:16.910 --> 05:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
Efficiency uh this is true in all of our
 
05:08:18.948 --> 05:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
commercial buildings it's true also in
 
05:08:21.270 --> 05:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
our public buildings it's true in our
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
schools uh the other thing these codes
 
05:08:26.150 --> 05:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
do 2021 in particular is it puts in a
 
05:08:28.910 --> 05:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
way to get fresh air into the building
 
05:08:31.350 --> 05:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
and it absorbs the Heat going out so
 
05:08:32.628 --> 05:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't get dumped to the
 
05:08:34.150 --> 05:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
atmosphere it's better than opening the
 
05:08:35.868 --> 05:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
window because it takes the heat that's
 
05:08:37.788 --> 05:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
leaving the building and transfers it to
 
05:08:40.310 --> 05:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
the incoming air through an energy
 
05:08:42.750 --> 05:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
recovery ventilator that gives you fresh
 
05:08:46.190 --> 05:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
clean air and still maintains the same
 
05:08:46.200 --> 05:08:47.270 align:start position:0%
clean air and still maintains the same
thermal

05:08:47.270 --> 05:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
thermal
 
05:08:49.830 --> 05:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
environment so there are many reasons
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
why the 2021 code makes a lot of sense
 
05:08:54.990 --> 05:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
if we continue to wait and study the
 
05:08:58.230 --> 05:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
2024 code we're going to miss the
 
05:09:01.030 --> 05:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to update these homes and
 
05:09:04.030 --> 05:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
buildings that are being built now and
 
05:09:05.948 --> 05:09:05.958 align:start position:0%
going back and trying to retrofit them
 
05:09:09.830 --> 05:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
is extremely expensive imagine trying to
 
05:09:11.750 --> 05:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
insulate a subfloor once it's been
 
05:09:13.750 --> 05:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
poured it's virtually impossible you
 
05:09:16.628 --> 05:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
have to Jackhammer it and try to do it
 
05:09:19.548 --> 05:09:19.558 align:start position:0%
or even the walls as John pointed out in
 
05:09:22.470 --> 05:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
an older home or ceilings very hard to
 
05:09:25.190 --> 05:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
do once the building's built but during
 
05:09:27.070 --> 05:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
the construction of the building putting
 
05:09:29.948 --> 05:09:29.958 align:start position:0%
a little more insulation in it putting
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
an improved vapor barrier in it or on it
 
05:09:37.070 --> 05:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
will improve it and make it last longer
 
05:09:39.628 --> 05:09:39.638 align:start position:0%
one other point about vapor barriers is
 
05:09:42.910 --> 05:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
that it extends the life of the building
 
05:09:45.708 --> 05:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
if moisture is coming in and say it's
 
05:09:48.190 --> 05:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
cold inside it's going to hit the cold
 
05:09:51.070 --> 05:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
condensate and make mold same thing on
 
05:09:53.110 --> 05:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
the way out if it's cold out and you're
 
05:09:55.548 --> 05:09:55.558 align:start position:0%
warm in moisture is going to go back out
 
05:09:58.590 --> 05:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
through the wall hit the cold make mold
 
05:10:00.110 --> 05:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
pollute the environment it's going to
 
05:10:03.390 --> 05:10:03.400 align:start position:0%
rot the wood happens over and over and
 
05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
over we've seen it many many times if
 
05:10:07.670 --> 05:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
you have a proper Vapor Barrier it
 
05:10:09.708 --> 05:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
cannot happen because moist moisture
 
05:10:13.030 --> 05:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
can't pass it so keeping the humidity in
 
05:10:15.788 --> 05:10:15.798 align:start position:0%
the environments constant or at least
 
05:10:17.910 --> 05:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
within the range of 40 to 60 is
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
important for human health keeping the
 
05:10:22.708 --> 05:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
temperature constant is a human comfort
 
05:10:25.948 --> 05:10:25.958 align:start position:0%
factor both of them tend to reduce the
 
05:10:29.030 --> 05:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
energy footprint to the point where you
 
05:10:31.150 --> 05:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
can operate with a
 
05:10:34.310 --> 05:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
lower heating cooling ventilation
 
05:10:36.470 --> 05:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
equipment this has been proven over and
 
05:10:36.480 --> 05:10:37.270 align:start position:0%
equipment this has been proven over and
over

05:10:37.270 --> 05:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:10:40.990 --> 05:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
again um in fact fact I want to just uh
 
05:10:42.670 --> 05:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
while I'm testifying read a statement
 
05:10:44.708 --> 05:10:44.718 align:start position:0%

unrelated but important other perks
 
05:11:39.470 --> 05:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
include the buildings that are healthier
 
05:11:41.830 --> 05:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
more comfortable for occupants more
 
05:11:44.910 --> 05:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
durable simpler easier to maintain and
 
05:11:47.430 --> 05:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
can continue to be occupied long after
 
05:11:49.868 --> 05:11:49.878 align:start position:0%
an event has knocked out the heating and
 
05:11:52.868 --> 05:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
cooling or taken an offline such as a
 
05:11:55.310 --> 05:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
grid failure or the inability to get
 
05:11:57.150 --> 05:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
fuel for some reason due to a
 
05:12:00.230 --> 05:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
catastrophic case this is in contrast to
 
05:12:01.708 --> 05:12:01.718 align:start position:0%
existing buildings that require
 
05:12:03.628 --> 05:12:03.638 align:start position:0%
evacuation during cold weather if the
 
05:12:05.470 --> 05:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
heat goes off during a coold snap
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
because the pipes will
 
05:12:10.590 --> 05:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
freeze James Peterson so I'm here to
 
05:12:13.230 --> 05:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
Advocate uh for no personal reason I
 
05:12:14.868 --> 05:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
05:12:18.350 --> 05:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
a an agenda here I there's no money
 
05:12:20.628 --> 05:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
involved with my situation I own a
 
05:12:22.910 --> 05:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
software company but I'm a building
 
05:12:25.470 --> 05:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
scientist I understand why these codes
 
05:12:28.868 --> 05:12:28.878 align:start position:0%
have been put in place I would adopt I
 
05:12:30.788 --> 05:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
would encourage the adoption of this
 
05:12:34.590 --> 05:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
house bill uh as quickly as we can do
 
05:12:37.670 --> 05:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
it I can also answer some questions that
 
05:12:40.390 --> 05:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
came up earlier if you would like U ones
 
05:12:42.750 --> 05:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
that you were asking
 
05:12:45.830 --> 05:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
about cost I already touched upon cost
 
05:12:48.390 --> 05:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
$2,300 is the estimated cost of the
 
05:12:50.990 --> 05:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
incremental increase associated with it
 
05:12:54.390 --> 05:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
I'd also like that's from 18 to 21 18 to
 
05:12:56.830 --> 05:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
21 that is correct thank you I'd also
 
05:12:59.910 --> 05:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
like to point out that uh if you finance
 
05:13:02.150 --> 05:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
your home which is quite normal the
 
05:13:04.948 --> 05:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
payback in terms of cash is quite quick
 
05:13:07.470 --> 05:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
The increased down payment would be
 
05:13:11.070 --> 05:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
$41 due to the $2,300 increment an
 
05:13:14.350 --> 05:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
increase of six a cost of $61 but the
 
05:13:15.788 --> 05:13:15.798 align:start position:0%
saving is is
 
05:13:19.350 --> 05:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
$537 per year so you're positive cash in
 
05:13:22.990 --> 05:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
two years total payback in six simple
 
05:13:26.150 --> 05:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
payback in six because the numbers are
 
05:13:28.708 --> 05:13:28.718 align:start position:0%
fairly modest it's fairly
 
05:13:32.510 --> 05:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
small I did I did review the report that
 
05:13:35.670 --> 05:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
was referenced by Mr Mayberry and the
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
report and the study that was done was
 
05:13:40.868 --> 05:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
heavily SL Ed in favor of a
 
05:13:43.948 --> 05:13:43.958 align:start position:0%
predetermined outcome um it seemed as
 
05:13:45.708 --> 05:13:45.718 align:start position:0%
though the people who were creating it
 
05:13:48.548 --> 05:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
wanted the numbers to look bad as an
 
05:13:50.948 --> 05:13:50.958 align:start position:0%
example they used a price of energy that
 
05:13:53.390 --> 05:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
was extremely low they used natural gas
 
05:13:55.350 --> 05:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
for example we don't all use natural gas
 
05:13:57.948 --> 05:13:57.958 align:start position:0%
here many people use oil and they used a
 
05:14:00.070 --> 05:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
number that was very very small when
 
05:14:03.070 --> 05:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
they went to look at cost they took the
 
05:14:05.150 --> 05:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
worst possible case in terms of cost
 
05:14:07.430 --> 05:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
increase and added that on and so the
 
05:14:09.750 --> 05:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
payback period looked bad
 
05:14:11.670 --> 05:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
so it was a simple case of trying to
 
05:14:14.150 --> 05:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
make the numbers look like they wanted
 
05:14:16.548 --> 05:14:16.558 align:start position:0%
to be a predetermined
 
05:14:18.788 --> 05:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
outcome since then there's been a couple
 
05:14:21.430 --> 05:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
of journalists that I could reference
 
05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
who have looked into this and found out
 
05:14:26.110 --> 05:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
the study was financed by the National
 
05:14:28.868 --> 05:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
Gas Association of the United States of
 
05:14:33.110 --> 05:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
America it's fossil fuel and uh it's not
 
05:14:35.230 --> 05:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
just New Hampshire this is a campaign
 
05:14:37.030 --> 05:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
ashray has been uh dealing with this
 
05:14:38.670 --> 05:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
issue this is a campaign that's gone on
 
05:14:41.590 --> 05:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
around the country uh the fossil fuel
 
05:14:43.708 --> 05:14:43.718 align:start position:0%
people want you to consume fossil fuels
 
05:14:46.310 --> 05:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
ex you don't you can't know their motive
 
05:14:48.750 --> 05:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
so please don't impune them facts are
 
05:14:51.350 --> 05:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
fine but no motives
 
05:14:54.270 --> 05:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
okay um ground Source heat pump came up
 
05:14:56.310 --> 05:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
as a question a ground Source heat pump
 
05:14:59.150 --> 05:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
is simply a device that pulls the energy
 
05:15:01.670 --> 05:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
out of the earth effectively the Earth
 
05:15:04.390 --> 05:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
runs at about 50 degrees most of the
 
05:15:06.708 --> 05:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
time nearly all the time if you're
 
05:15:09.390 --> 05:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
trying to get your home to 70 you simply
 
05:15:11.910 --> 05:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
use the 50 to go to the 70 it's a
 
05:15:14.788 --> 05:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
difference of 20 that's what it does it
 
05:15:16.788 --> 05:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
pulls the heat out of the earth to heat
 
05:15:19.830 --> 05:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
the home the 2024 code does not mandate
 
05:15:21.788 --> 05:15:21.798 align:start position:0%
it but no one would ever mandate what
 
05:15:23.868 --> 05:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
kind of heating cooling system you would
 
05:15:25.990 --> 05:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
have there are different types there's
 
05:15:28.470 --> 05:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
an air source heat pump many people have
 
05:15:31.750 --> 05:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
them I got one from my home it is a a
 
05:15:33.750 --> 05:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
air-to-air system sits on the side of
 
05:15:36.430 --> 05:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
the house so you can use air as the
 
05:15:38.708 --> 05:15:38.718 align:start position:0%
source but on a cold day that air like
 
05:15:41.548 --> 05:15:41.558 align:start position:0%
to day is -3° a little hard to pull heat
 
05:15:45.070 --> 05:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
out of a minus33 dee air but the ground
 
05:15:48.110 --> 05:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
is 50 so ground sour SE pumps are more
 
05:15:49.948 --> 05:15:49.958 align:start position:0%
efficient from an energy point of view
 
05:15:51.430 --> 05:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
but the capital cost is higher because
 
05:15:53.628 --> 05:15:53.638 align:start position:0%
you have to drill a well and they put a
 
05:15:55.390 --> 05:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
loop down in the well and pull the heat
 
05:15:57.670 --> 05:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
out of the water is how they actually do
 
05:16:00.910 --> 05:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
it very efficient people love them but
 
05:16:03.510 --> 05:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
the capital cost is fairly high for
 
05:16:07.230 --> 05:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
those um benefits I think Bruce went
 
05:16:08.948 --> 05:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
over most of the benefits one of them
 
05:16:11.548 --> 05:16:11.558 align:start position:0%
I'll add is life of the building goes
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
way up there's an estimated 20 degree uh
 
05:16:16.470 --> 05:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
20y year increase in the life of the
 
05:16:18.830 --> 05:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
building because moisture is not going
 
05:16:20.270 --> 05:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
back and forth through the walls and
 
05:16:23.430 --> 05:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
rotting the walls so you don't have mold
 
05:16:26.510 --> 05:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
problems you don't have rot because you
 
05:16:29.190 --> 05:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
have a proper vapor barrier in
 
05:16:29.200 --> 05:16:31.548 align:start position:0%
have a proper vapor barrier in
place

05:16:31.548 --> 05:16:31.558 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:16:34.230 --> 05:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
um I think that was a few of them at
 
05:16:34.240 --> 05:16:35.990 align:start position:0%
um I think that was a few of them at
least

05:16:35.990 --> 05:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
least
 
05:16:37.868 --> 05:16:37.878 align:start position:0%
questions are there questions
 
05:16:39.830 --> 05:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative Leo um thank you madam
 
05:16:41.510 --> 05:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for bringing this to
 
05:16:44.788 --> 05:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
us um I in my spare time like to read
 
05:16:47.310 --> 05:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
things like Green Building advisor and I
 
05:16:49.310 --> 05:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
was definitely very interested following
 
05:16:51.310 --> 05:16:51.320 align:start position:0%
their process with finding the correct
 
05:16:53.470 --> 05:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
location of the vapor barrier and if
 
05:16:55.628 --> 05:16:55.638 align:start position:0%
that's located in the wrong place based
 
05:16:57.270 --> 05:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
upon the level of insulation in the
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
house you may actually cause new
 
05:17:01.590 --> 05:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
structural problems is that something
 
05:17:03.390 --> 05:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
that's now been solved because quite
 
05:17:04.990 --> 05:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
frankly I haven't read that in the last
 
05:17:06.910 --> 05:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
year or so but I do know that that was a
 
05:17:10.390 --> 05:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
significant problem for a building yes
 
05:17:12.830 --> 05:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
it has been solved um the idea on a
 
05:17:15.708 --> 05:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
vapor Berry is put it outside let the
 
05:17:18.590 --> 05:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
wall breathe to the inside um you can do
 
05:17:20.350 --> 05:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
it the other way but that's generally
 
05:17:22.548 --> 05:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
how it's been solved is to put it on the
 
05:17:25.030 --> 05:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
outside uh high performance buildings
 
05:17:28.390 --> 05:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
today will basically wrap them uh the
 
05:17:31.150 --> 05:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
one in Maine I reviewed had a
 
05:17:34.150 --> 05:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
rubber wrapper on it and they encased it
 
05:17:36.150 --> 05:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
on the outside let the room breathe to
 
05:17:38.390 --> 05:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
the inside that allows the drying to
 
05:17:40.310 --> 05:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
take place mold and rot will happen if
 
05:17:42.510 --> 05:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't dry so you have to put it all
 
05:17:45.750 --> 05:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
the way out to the outside and then put
 
05:17:48.628 --> 05:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
rain screen so that the water hitting
 
05:17:51.190 --> 05:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
the clapboards or whatever can drain and
 
05:17:54.868 --> 05:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
dry and then let the vapor dry to the
 
05:17:57.548 --> 05:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
inside from that barrier the answer is
 
05:17:59.948 --> 05:17:59.958 align:start position:0%
yes follow and as a followup um does
 
05:18:02.948 --> 05:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
that also requ um is that conditional on
 
05:18:04.750 --> 05:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
the quality of the in installation
 
05:18:06.708 --> 05:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
because I've seen those vapor barriers
 
05:18:08.390 --> 05:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
flapping In The Wind that were never
 
05:18:11.510 --> 05:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
approp rely um connected and it's my
 
05:18:12.670 --> 05:18:12.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that those pin holes
 
05:18:14.628 --> 05:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
actually have a larger water intrusion
 
05:18:17.670 --> 05:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
because um we won't get into the nerdy
 
05:18:20.470 --> 05:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
side of this but um you are right you've
 
05:18:23.390 --> 05:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
been studying um this this goes to the
 
05:18:25.548 --> 05:18:25.558 align:start position:0%
issue of commissioning commissioning is
 
05:18:27.548 --> 05:18:27.558 align:start position:0%
something that we don't require today
 
05:18:29.670 --> 05:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
the the bill that's been introduced by a
 
05:18:33.230 --> 05:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
representative here H HB the house bill
 
05:18:35.390 --> 05:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
96 requires commissioning we put it back
 
05:18:37.670 --> 05:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
in because commissioning is the testing
 
05:18:39.670 --> 05:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
of the building and you are quite right
 
05:18:42.030 --> 05:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
if you do not test it you don't know if
 
05:18:44.830 --> 05:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
you've achieved the goal so testing is
 
05:18:46.948 --> 05:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
an extremely important component of all
 
05:18:49.590 --> 05:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
of this stuff we test for structural we
 
05:18:51.628 --> 05:18:51.638 align:start position:0%
test for smoke we test for many many
 
05:18:53.350 --> 05:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
things we're going to put a vapor
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
barrier on and not test for it at all so
 
05:18:59.548 --> 05:18:59.558 align:start position:0%
we would Advocate that testing should
 
05:19:01.670 --> 05:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
occur at the end of a cycle to ensure
 
05:19:03.948 --> 05:19:03.958 align:start position:0%
that the building meets the criteria
 
05:19:06.510 --> 05:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
that set forth in the
 
05:19:09.310 --> 05:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
specification um is that actually part
 
05:19:12.628 --> 05:19:12.638 align:start position:0%
of the 21 energy code for for houses
 
05:19:14.948 --> 05:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
commissioning always has been y it's in
 
05:19:16.230 --> 05:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
there it's
 
05:19:18.830 --> 05:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
actually um it's been in the energy
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
codes many many years the state New
 
05:19:26.350 --> 05:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has amended it out probably
 
05:19:29.230 --> 05:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
for the last 10 years as an older
 
05:19:31.230 --> 05:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
standard and it keeps coming back every
 
05:19:33.230 --> 05:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
year as a c every three years as a
 
05:19:34.990 --> 05:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
carryover Amendment than it really
 
05:19:37.310 --> 05:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be for the commercial side
 
05:19:41.150 --> 05:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you what represent
 
05:19:45.070 --> 05:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
bre Mr beamus beus B M did I get that
 
05:19:49.070 --> 05:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
right um you mentioned the study that
 
05:19:51.788 --> 05:19:51.798 align:start position:0%
estimated believe it was I think you
 
05:19:55.110 --> 05:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
said 2350 or or
 
05:19:55.120 --> 05:19:57.510 align:start position:0%
said 2350 or or
2372

05:19:57.510 --> 05:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
2372
 
05:20:01.708 --> 05:20:01.718 align:start position:0%
$2,372 and you you cited the um author
 
05:20:03.150 --> 05:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
of that study could you repeat that for
 
05:20:05.590 --> 05:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
me I didn't Pacific Northwest National
 
05:20:08.830 --> 05:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
Laboratory Pacific Northwest Norwest PN
 
05:20:11.590 --> 05:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
NL Pacific Northwest National
 
05:20:14.868 --> 05:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
Laboratory they are one of the big doe
 
05:20:18.430 --> 05:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh research facilities out of uh
 
05:20:22.190 --> 05:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
Oregon I believe and uh they do an awful
 
05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
lot of energy modeling they're
 
05:20:27.510 --> 05:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for the gold standard for
 
05:20:31.708 --> 05:20:31.718 align:start position:0%
energy uh modeling called doe2 do2 codes
 
05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
that are used by everybody in the world
 
05:20:37.310 --> 05:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
to model the efficiency of
 
05:20:42.030 --> 05:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
buildings p out um quickly well
 
05:20:45.548 --> 05:20:45.558 align:start position:0%
hopefully quickly um the and and who
 
05:20:47.390 --> 05:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
find you mentioned who financed the
 
05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
other study uh natural I think it was
 
05:20:52.070 --> 05:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
natural gas who finances that is it a is
 
05:20:53.990 --> 05:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
it a federal federally funded program
 
05:20:56.030 --> 05:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
yes it's a it's actually ashray does a
 
05:20:58.350 --> 05:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
lot of the funding we we we raise money
 
05:21:00.868 --> 05:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
for for that so it's funded through
 
05:21:03.190 --> 05:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
organizations including ashray yeah okay
 
05:21:06.628 --> 05:21:06.638 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome okay other
 
05:21:08.830 --> 05:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank thank you
 
05:21:12.150 --> 05:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:14.510 --> 05:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Schmidt sorry did you
 
05:21:18.190 --> 05:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
have a question well I do know so
 
05:21:21.190 --> 05:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
you've given us a lot of
 
05:21:24.430 --> 05:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
scientific explanation for a number of
 
05:21:27.150 --> 05:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
the issues that we're confronting here
 
05:21:29.708 --> 05:21:29.718 align:start position:0%
uh but you undoubtedly have listened as
 
05:21:33.390 --> 05:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
we were listen other people before you
 
05:21:36.708 --> 05:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to a subcommittee meeting
 
05:21:39.430 --> 05:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
that will be com hence forth
 
05:21:42.350 --> 05:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh to work through these problems that
 
05:21:46.190 --> 05:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
we have been uh hearing about today uh
 
05:21:48.628 --> 05:21:48.638 align:start position:0%
you've come from I don't see your PIN
 
05:21:52.470 --> 05:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
card uh where are you both from I am
 
05:21:54.270 --> 05:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
from uh Bristol New Hampshire I'm the
 
05:21:56.430 --> 05:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
chair of the Bristol energy committee as
 
05:21:59.510 --> 05:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
well uh my family dates back 300 years
 
05:22:02.150 --> 05:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
in this uh in this state back when I was
 
05:22:05.310 --> 05:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
a kid okay and I'm Bruce butrick and I'm
 
05:22:09.190 --> 05:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
from gtown okay I'm retired I do have
 
05:22:11.310 --> 05:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
time if it's possible I think I would
 
05:22:13.230 --> 05:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
volunteer some member from our local
 
05:22:15.390 --> 05:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
chapter of ashray it'll be in the
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
calendar when the subcommittee perfect
 
05:22:19.868 --> 05:22:19.878 align:start position:0%
oh great thank you it will be noticed at
 
05:22:19.878 --> 05:22:20.948 align:start position:0%
oh great thank you it will be noticed at
any

05:22:20.948 --> 05:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:22:23.590 --> 05:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
rate okay thank you very much thank you
 
05:22:24.830 --> 05:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
for your time
 
05:22:49.868 --> 05:22:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:51.390 --> 05:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
okay good morning uh good afternoon
 
05:22:53.190 --> 05:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is uh
 
05:22:54.990 --> 05:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
and fortunately chair McGuire has seen
 
05:22:58.110 --> 05:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
me testify on this topic many many times
 
05:23:00.270 --> 05:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
um I am the director of energy
 
05:23:02.310 --> 05:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
transition from clean energy New
 
05:23:04.390 --> 05:23:04.400 align:start position:0%

05:23:06.270 --> 05:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
organization as many people think we
 
05:23:09.350 --> 05:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
actually have uh there are five 1c3 that
 
05:23:12.110 --> 05:23:12.120 align:start position:0%

representatives and we also have 130

businesses that are our members as well
 
05:23:31.390 --> 05:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
our goal is to advance a clean
 
05:23:33.868 --> 05:23:33.878 align:start position:0%
affordable reliable energy in the state
 
05:23:37.350 --> 05:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
and Energy Efficiency is a primarily uh
 
05:23:39.310 --> 05:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
element of that realizing that this is
 
05:23:40.948 --> 05:23:40.958 align:start position:0%
going to go to a subcommittee and we've
 
05:23:42.270 --> 05:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
been in this room for almost an hour and
 
05:23:44.948 --> 05:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
a half um I'll keep my remarks brief and
 
05:23:48.868 --> 05:23:48.878 align:start position:0%
just uh note that I've been following
 
05:23:51.150 --> 05:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
this process possibly longer than anyone
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
else in this room with the exception of
 
05:23:56.230 --> 05:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh chair McGuire uh we've been follow
 
05:23:57.708 --> 05:23:57.718 align:start position:0%
I've been working on this since about
 
05:24:00.390 --> 05:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
2009 when I started with the state um
 
05:24:01.990 --> 05:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
following the building of code viiew
 
05:24:03.750 --> 05:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
board throughout that process and I'm
 
05:24:06.030 --> 05:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with the adoption of the 2015
 
05:24:09.948 --> 05:24:09.958 align:start position:0%
2018 and 2021 codes and so a few things
 
05:24:11.190 --> 05:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to kind of draw
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
attention to um
 
05:24:18.430 --> 05:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
the data that was represent referenced
 
05:24:21.190 --> 05:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
regarding Senator Shaheen although I've
 
05:24:22.350 --> 05:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
been here almost long enough that she
 
05:24:25.150 --> 05:24:25.160 align:start position:0%
was governor when I started um actually
 
05:24:28.110 --> 05:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
she is quoted at the value that very was
 
05:24:30.430 --> 05:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
very similar to what Paul vimma said at
 
05:24:33.350 --> 05:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
about $2,300 in added costs and $500 in
 
05:24:35.830 --> 05:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
annual savings as opposed to a $177,000
 
05:24:38.590 --> 05:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
value so I would recommend that the
 
05:24:42.310 --> 05:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee gets together that any data
 
05:24:45.190 --> 05:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
that is shared it comes fully cited um
 
05:24:47.750 --> 05:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
and is documented who the authors are uh
 
05:24:49.788 --> 05:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
as that as was noted by other speakers
 
05:24:51.788 --> 05:24:51.798 align:start position:0%
we've got a number of studies out there
 
05:24:53.510 --> 05:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
and who the authors are and where the
 
05:24:56.230 --> 05:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
funding comes from is important um I
 
05:24:57.910 --> 05:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
also wanted to note that the building
 
05:25:03.110 --> 05:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
code for the state which is found in RSA
 
05:25:07.230 --> 05:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
155a section 4 so Roman numeral 4 the
 
05:25:08.788 --> 05:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
definition of the building code code
 
05:25:10.390 --> 05:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
includes the plumbing code the
 
05:25:12.830 --> 05:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
electrical code The Mechanical Code the
 
05:25:15.990 --> 05:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
building code the existing building code
 
05:25:19.230 --> 05:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
the fire code the pool and spa code and
 
05:25:21.270 --> 05:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
the energy code the energy code is a
 
05:25:23.310 --> 05:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
chapter of the state's overall building
 
05:25:25.310 --> 05:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
code so it is not separate but it is an
 
05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
essential element to give you an idea of
 
05:25:29.110 --> 05:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
how essential if there is no energy code
 
05:25:30.830 --> 05:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
we basically live in shells that leak
 
05:25:33.830 --> 05:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
all of the heat out or cooled air in the
 
05:25:36.230 --> 05:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
summer very quickly in our unlivable
 
05:25:38.868 --> 05:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
structures so without the energy code we
 
05:25:41.750 --> 05:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
basically just have um the shed that my
 
05:25:43.910 --> 05:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
chickens are currently suffering through
 
05:25:45.628 --> 05:25:45.638 align:start position:0%
this weather
 
05:25:49.788 --> 05:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
in um but we to get back to our point do
 
05:25:52.110 --> 05:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
support the adoption of the 2021 code
 
05:25:54.430 --> 05:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
because it is in advance over the 2018
 
05:25:56.948 --> 05:25:56.958 align:start position:0%
code when we adopted the 2018 code in
 
05:25:59.350 --> 05:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
2022 there was virtually no benefit in
 
05:26:02.948 --> 05:26:02.958 align:start position:0%
advancing from the 2015 to the 2018 code
 
05:26:06.510 --> 05:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
the 2015 code was a significant jump in
 
05:26:08.350 --> 05:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
efficiency which meant that there was a
 
05:26:10.230 --> 05:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
significant savings to all homes that
 
05:26:12.990 --> 05:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
were built under that standard the 2018
 
05:26:14.708 --> 05:26:14.718 align:start position:0%
code was more of an administrative
 
05:26:16.948 --> 05:26:16.958 align:start position:0%
change that cleaned up some of the ways
 
05:26:19.310 --> 05:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
that the building code was administered
 
05:26:22.270 --> 05:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
by building officials the 2021 code is
 
05:26:25.430 --> 05:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
in advance and that it does add some
 
05:26:28.310 --> 05:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
cost but some that that total cost is
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
quoted in by Senator Sheen as well as
 
05:26:32.910 --> 05:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
the Pacific Northwest National Lab at
 
05:26:35.868 --> 05:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
about $2,300 with significant savings
 
05:26:38.310 --> 05:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
for a homeowner on day one but but
 
05:26:40.628 --> 05:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
that's for an average house of 2 2400 ft
 
05:26:41.708 --> 05:26:41.718 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about affordable
 
05:26:43.708 --> 05:26:43.718 align:start position:0%
housing the cost is going to be smaller
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
and that's for a
 
05:26:47.910 --> 05:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
2400t detached single family home if
 
05:26:50.670 --> 05:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
it's in uh affordable housing the
 
05:26:52.470 --> 05:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
building size will like or the footprint
 
05:26:54.708 --> 05:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
will be smaller but the cost to the
 
05:26:56.708 --> 05:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
consumer will also be smaller even if
 
05:26:58.628 --> 05:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
they are seeing a similar
 
05:27:02.548 --> 05:27:02.558 align:start position:0%
benefit um and so the 2021 code was
 
05:27:05.430 --> 05:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
largely held up
 
05:27:08.430 --> 05:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
um due to arguments that were made at
 
05:27:09.548 --> 05:27:09.558 align:start position:0%
the building code review board but I
 
05:27:10.750 --> 05:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
will note that the building code review
 
05:27:12.948 --> 05:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
board does not have a consumer Advocate
 
05:27:15.470 --> 05:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
or a building scientist on it instead it
 
05:27:17.110 --> 05:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
includes members of Industry who are
 
05:27:19.350 --> 05:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
being lobbied by mil members of industry
 
05:27:21.868 --> 05:27:21.878 align:start position:0%
and so the conversation may happen there
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
in front of experts but there are
 
05:27:26.030 --> 05:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
specific interests that are brought
 
05:27:28.350 --> 05:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
before that board that may not get to
 
05:27:30.110 --> 05:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
all the facts the fact that there is not
 
05:27:33.788 --> 05:27:33.798 align:start position:0%
a consumer voice on that board is very
 
05:27:35.030 --> 05:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
important and should be taken into
 
05:27:36.788 --> 05:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
consideration when hearing the facts
 
05:27:39.708 --> 05:27:39.718 align:start position:0%
before you so I'll close and note that
 
05:27:42.270 --> 05:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
we would ask that the 2021 code because
 
05:27:44.708 --> 05:27:44.718 align:start position:0%
it does deliver real savings that are
 
05:27:46.990 --> 05:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
paid back in a very short amount of time
 
05:27:49.670 --> 05:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
do be Advanced and that the 2024 code
 
05:27:52.350 --> 05:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
not be an amendment made to this bill
 
05:27:53.910 --> 05:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
allow the building code review board to
 
05:27:56.070 --> 05:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
continue their conversation uh they have
 
05:27:58.390 --> 05:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
not finished reviewing it um we will be
 
05:28:00.830 --> 05:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
arguing for an unamended 2024 code in
 
05:28:03.510 --> 05:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
front of that body but for this one uh
 
05:28:05.430 --> 05:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
we should stick with the 2021 code and
 
05:28:06.788 --> 05:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
then keep it
 
05:28:09.390 --> 05:28:09.400 align:start position:0%
in consist consistent with the rest of
 
05:28:12.670 --> 05:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
the chapters of the states building code
 
05:28:14.390 --> 05:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
but we are happy to bring more
 
05:28:15.670 --> 05:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
information to that subcommittee and
 
05:28:20.070 --> 05:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:23.350 --> 05:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
noticed thank you are there any
 
05:28:27.190 --> 05:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
questions yes for long you mentioned
 
05:28:29.948 --> 05:28:29.958 align:start position:0%
renters in your handout here do you have
 
05:28:33.350 --> 05:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
a sense of what percentage of renters
 
05:28:35.310 --> 05:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
have to pay for their electricity
 
05:28:37.270 --> 05:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
directly versus having it rolled into
 
05:28:38.670 --> 05:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
the rent we
 
05:28:41.270 --> 05:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
I do not but I can look that up and see
 
05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
I do know that there is a challenge it's
 
05:28:45.868 --> 05:28:45.878 align:start position:0%
called the split incentive where uh the
 
05:28:48.350 --> 05:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
building code ends up being a consumer
 
05:28:50.548 --> 05:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
protection mechanism so the building
 
05:28:53.110 --> 05:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
energy code does because developers that
 
05:28:54.190 --> 05:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
are building homes that they're going to
 
05:28:56.310 --> 05:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
rent out if they're not paying the
 
05:28:57.990 --> 05:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
electric bill may not have the incentive
 
05:28:59.708 --> 05:28:59.718 align:start position:0%
to build to that higher standard knowing
 
05:29:03.110 --> 05:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
that renters we have a 05% vacancy rate
 
05:29:04.868 --> 05:29:04.878 align:start position:0%
in the state we don't get to pick and
 
05:29:07.750 --> 05:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
choose where uh we live I have friends
 
05:29:10.150 --> 05:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
or students at UNH that are trying to
 
05:29:12.030 --> 05:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
find housing and it's very hard they're
 
05:29:14.470 --> 05:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
taking what they can find so it ends up
 
05:29:15.948 --> 05:29:15.958 align:start position:0%
being consumer protection especially for
 
05:29:17.430 --> 05:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
residents because they don't get to pick
 
05:29:19.830 --> 05:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
to the design the features they get to
 
05:29:22.910 --> 05:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
pick what's available and so
 
05:29:26.910 --> 05:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
oh well uh I only said electricity but I
 
05:29:30.390 --> 05:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
meant to include heat that question as
 
05:29:33.190 --> 05:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
well I I know that when I was renting um
 
05:29:35.270 --> 05:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
my landlord asked me why our bill was so
 
05:29:37.230 --> 05:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
low uh because he was paying it and he
 
05:29:38.670 --> 05:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to know how we could get the
 
05:29:42.110 --> 05:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
other renters to do the same
 
05:29:44.948 --> 05:29:44.958 align:start position:0%
thing represent Leon thank you madam
 
05:29:47.548 --> 05:29:47.558 align:start position:0%
chair um and uh thank you for bringing
 
05:29:48.868 --> 05:29:48.878 align:start position:0%
up chicken coops I actually built
 
05:29:50.708 --> 05:29:50.718 align:start position:0%
Fortress fowl which was ridiculously
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
overbuilt with rain gaps and insulation
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
um but that actually ties back to your
 
05:29:58.030 --> 05:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
discussion about the average 2400 foot
 
05:30:00.350 --> 05:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
house versus affordable housing uh
 
05:30:03.390 --> 05:30:03.400 align:start position:0%
because every linear foot of that
 
05:30:05.590 --> 05:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
insulation was actually insulating less
 
05:30:08.070 --> 05:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
of the Interior Space so while you made
 
05:30:09.708 --> 05:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
be building a is it correct that while
 
05:30:12.470 --> 05:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
you may be building a smaller home for
 
05:30:15.150 --> 05:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
an affordable house uh you still you may
 
05:30:17.070 --> 05:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
have you have a different ratio of your
 
05:30:19.708 --> 05:30:19.718 align:start position:0%
wall space so the instulation cost
 
05:30:22.350 --> 05:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
higher per square foot well it depends
 
05:30:24.110 --> 05:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
affordable housing can include multi
 
05:30:26.350 --> 05:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
family housing and so the units adjacent
 
05:30:28.190 --> 05:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
to you can actually buffer against and
 
05:30:30.230 --> 05:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
therefore increase the total mass of the
 
05:30:32.628 --> 05:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
space reduce the surface area to volume
 
05:30:33.948 --> 05:30:33.958 align:start position:0%
ratio and therefore make the building
 
05:30:36.590 --> 05:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
overall more efficient it may not feel
 
05:30:39.590 --> 05:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
as spacious but that does factor in cost
 
05:30:42.670 --> 05:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
so the the per unit cost will depend on
 
05:30:45.230 --> 05:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
whether you're building a tiny house or
 
05:30:47.830 --> 05:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
whether you're building a 2400 average
 
05:30:51.670 --> 05:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
home or you're building a multi family
 
05:30:54.470 --> 05:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh unit that is three stories and above
 
05:30:55.868 --> 05:30:55.878 align:start position:0%
and therefore subject to the commercial
 
05:30:59.910 --> 05:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
energy code thank you okay other
 
05:31:02.390 --> 05:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
05:31:03.910 --> 05:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll see you in committee is
 
05:31:05.750 --> 05:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wishes to testify
 
05:31:09.708 --> 05:31:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:11.670 --> 05:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any I'm going to close
 
05:31:15.030 --> 05:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
the public hearing uh afraid it will
 
05:31:16.310 --> 05:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
have to go to
 
05:31:18.390 --> 05:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and
 
05:31:21.430 --> 05:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
um we are done for the day resuming 10
 
05:31:21.440 --> 05:31:30.910 align:start position:0%
um we are done for the day resuming 10
o'clock

05:31:30.910 --> 05:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:33.548 --> 05:31:33.558 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I won't do this but I'm tempted
 
05:31:36.310 --> 05:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
to address the committee this take about
 
05:31:42.670 --> 05:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:53.230 --> 05:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:56.510 --> 05:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
need I don't
 
05:32:08.190 --> 05:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:09.910 --> 05:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
and it's amazing what this incandescent
 
05:32:14.230 --> 05:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
can do 0% of yeah but and that's the
 
05:32:15.708 --> 05:32:15.718 align:start position:0%
thing if we're heating our homes it's
 
05:32:18.590 --> 05:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
actually not terrible there's small heat
 
05:32:18.600 --> 05:32:23.670 align:start position:0%
actually not terrible there's small heat
sources

05:32:23.670 --> 05:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:25.590 --> 05:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
exactly thank
 
05:32:27.868 --> 05:32:27.878 align:start position:0%
you sorry I have a brother who's a
 
05:32:32.750 --> 05:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
materials engineer so yes a car me
 
05:32:35.470 --> 05:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
anything actually you should give one to
 
05:32:37.190 --> 05:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
represent of shean because she's she's
 
05:33:06.750 --> 05:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
