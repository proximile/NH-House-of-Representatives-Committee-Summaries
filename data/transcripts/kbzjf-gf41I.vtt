00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:59.030 align:start position:0%
much so I have a question for you as
well<00:09:57.240><c> um</c><00:09:57.959><c> right</c><00:09:58.320><c> the</c><00:09:58.399><c> way</c><00:09:58.519><c> that</c><00:09:58.640><c> I'm</c><00:09:58.800><c> reading</c>

00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
well um right the way that I'm reading
 

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.990 align:start position:0%
well um right the way that I'm reading
this<00:09:59.200><c> is</c><00:09:59.480><c> seems</c><00:10:00.000><c> that</c><00:10:00.240><c> if</c><00:10:00.360><c> somebody</c><00:10:00.680><c> was</c><00:10:00.839><c> out</c>

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
this is seems that if somebody was out
 

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.829 align:start position:0%
this is seems that if somebody was out

they<00:10:03.920><c> would</c><00:10:04.120><c> have</c><00:10:04.279><c> one</c><00:10:04.480><c> year</c><00:10:04.640><c> of</c><00:10:04.800><c> service</c>

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
they would have one year of service
 

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.750 align:start position:0%
they would have one year of service

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
added to that pension but that other
 

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.509 align:start position:0%
added to that pension but that other
year<00:10:07.120><c> just</c><00:10:07.480><c> wouldn't</c><00:10:07.800><c> count</c><00:10:08.040><c> towards</c><00:10:08.360><c> the</c>

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:24.430 align:start position:0%
for that and I think that when someone

is Gravely injured like that they
 

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.669 align:start position:0%
is Gravely injured like that they

01:50:40.119 --> 01:50:42.270 align:start position:0%
goes smoothly those go through with some
changes<01:50:41.119><c> um</c><01:50:41.239><c> so</c><01:50:41.360><c> we</c><01:50:41.480><c> have</c><01:50:41.560><c> a</c><01:50:41.679><c> very</c><01:50:41.840><c> clear</c>

01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
changes um so we have a very clear
 

01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:47.229 align:start position:0%
changes um so we have a very clear
process<01:50:43.000><c> now</c><01:50:44.000><c> um</c><01:50:44.800><c> and</c><01:50:45.000><c> so</c><01:50:46.000><c> what</c><01:50:46.360><c> that</c><01:50:46.679><c> does</c><01:50:47.119><c> is</c>

01:50:47.229 --> 01:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
process now um and so what that does is
 

01:50:47.239 --> 01:50:50.790 align:start position:0%
process now um and so what that does is
it<01:50:47.480><c> updates</c><01:50:48.239><c> the</c><01:50:48.440><c> codes</c><01:50:48.960><c> across</c><01:50:49.440><c> the</c><01:50:49.639><c> state</c><01:50:50.599><c> uh</c>

01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
it updates the codes across the state uh
 

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:54.030 align:start position:0%
it updates the codes across the state uh
every<01:50:51.079><c> three</c><01:50:51.639><c> years</c><01:50:52.639><c> so</c><01:50:52.840><c> some</c><01:50:52.960><c> of</c><01:50:53.119><c> that</c><01:50:53.599><c> prior</c>

01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
every three years so some of that prior
 

01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:58.069 align:start position:0%
every three years so some of that prior

01:50:58.069 --> 01:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
legislation that was referenced um they
 

01:50:58.079 --> 01:51:00.510 align:start position:0%
legislation that was referenced um they
it<01:50:58.239><c> did</c><01:50:58.560><c> update</c><01:50:59.040><c> both</c><01:50:59.360><c> definitions</c><01:51:00.199><c> as</c><01:51:00.360><c> well</c>

01:51:00.510 --> 01:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
it did update both definitions as well
 

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:03.830 align:start position:0%
it did update both definitions as well
as<01:51:00.960><c> codes</c><01:51:01.920><c> so</c><01:51:02.119><c> one</c><01:51:02.239><c> of</c><01:51:02.360><c> the</c><01:51:02.679><c> problems</c><01:51:03.239><c> that</c>

01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
as codes so one of the problems that
 

01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:06.390 align:start position:0%
