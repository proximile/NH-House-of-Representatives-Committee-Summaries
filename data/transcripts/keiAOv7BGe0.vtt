still in the same order right okay all
 
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 align:start position:0%

it there's a big there's a large hole

rung if you'd like to speak uh on this
 
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
on this issue thank you very much Mr
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
chair um before the public hearing when
 
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
this came before us um I had met with u
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
Mr Quinn from the New Hampshire realtors
 
00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:16.469 align:start position:0%
Mr Quinn from the New Hampshire realtors
association

00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
and I you know he showed me the um
 
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
paperwork that's used in a sale of
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
property and where I wanted to have some
 
00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
notice to the buyer of their
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility and the under the
 
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
shoreline water quality protection act
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
that they would be alerted there really
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't um an appropriate space on that
 
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
form to do that and Our intention was to
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
work together to find another solution
 
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
to it but it's not going to happen
 
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
through this bill um so um I'd like to
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
make a motion not to recommend this um
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
and I would I'm going to just continue
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
to work with Mr Quinn and see if we can
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
find a non-legislative
 
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
um solution to um make sure that um
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's com a greater compliance with
 
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
the shoreline water quality protection
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
act okay all right though this is a work
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
session so we I'm sorry sorry I'm just
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
explaining to every okay that we uh
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
we're not taking any motions we're
 
00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:22.519 align:start position:0%
taking uh uh we're discussing the uh
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
issue and also we're going to be taking
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh a input from members of the public
 
00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
so so that's just my yeah so I think you
 
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
know initially I wanted if you look at
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
the purchase and sales agreement that's
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
signed between the seller and the buyer
 
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
there are sections where the seller has
 
00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:47.079 align:start position:0%
to or the the buyer is getting
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
notification about something it could be
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
wellwater you know potential
 
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:55.160 align:start position:0%
contaminants and well water for instance
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
um radon um stuff like that but that
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
notice that would impact someone's
 
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:05.720 align:start position:0%
health or their ability to use the
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
property the notice I I want to give to
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
buyers doesn't fall into that category
 
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
um it's really just saying you're now
 
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
purchasing property within a shoreline
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
protection Zone and you have there's
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
compli there's compliance that you have
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
to ensure occurs because of the
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
shoreline water quality protection act
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
um but that form that purchase and sales
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
form isn't going to be um the
 
00:10:34.629 --> 00:10:34.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate vehicle to make that
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
communication so um I think this bill
 
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
just needs to have a dignified dep and
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to work with the Realtors on
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
maybe a a pamphlet or some other
 
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
communication relating to that property
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
that they can be given that's kind of
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
outlines what their responsibilities are
 
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
you know for in I'll give you an example
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
um I don't live my my home in Mar Mac
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't abut any public Waters so my
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
husband and I can cut down trees um we
 
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
it really isn't a big concern but if you
 
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
do that on property that's within 50 ft
 
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
of the shoreline you are very limited in
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
the trees that you can cut there has to
 
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
be very specific measurements done of
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
the number of trees there circumference
 
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
you can't exceed a certain total
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
circumference so that's something that
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
people may not even be aware that they
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
have to comply with that because if
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
they're moving from a property that
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't that isn't AB buding public
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
Waters that has never been a concern to
 
00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
them until they're within the shoreline
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I I only had one cup of
 
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
coffee today
 
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
so but uh anyway so that's why I mean
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
the bill definitely had good intentions
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
I think particularly with the summer
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
we've had with cyanobacteria blooms
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
there now has been a lot of attention on
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
the shoreline protection act and what
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
has to happen to comply with it and I
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
think I think some of the um
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
environmental organizations like Lake W
 
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
nasaki Association um oapi Alliance um
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes has certainly ramped
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
up a lot of education on this um and I
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
think that should continue and I just
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
think it's still kind of we're we're
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
going in the right direction I'm not
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
quite sure it's at a point where we need
 
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
legislation on
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
it so so you have not uh or do not
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
intend to
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
put forth legislation correct this term
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
yeah any questions uh or any comments by
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
other members of the
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
committee representative harm thank you
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I when it comes time for
 
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
executing I would support that motion
 
00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:49.959 align:start position:0%
for maybe a slightly different reason
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
but for the same result that I think it
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
needs a little more study okay thank you
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
is there uh any
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh anyone from
 
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
audience who wishes to speak to this
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
issue before we before I take
 
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
a a and it'll be a show of hands because
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
we're not taking the vote with will not
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
take the actual vote on
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
anything uh at this at the this this at
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
this part of the hearing at this hearing
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
but we will have be executing at all of
 
00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:26.839 align:start position:0%
these at
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
11:30 representative wolf
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
I can agree with representative rung
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
that this bill as presented isn't ready
 
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
for prime time but I
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
do now that I'm leaving leave it up to
 
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
you people that I think there should be
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
some sort of notification we see this
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
around our Lakes all the time where
 
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:52.759 align:start position:0%
people come up
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
they build Beaches they put uh cut trees
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
and oh I didn't know it was any
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
different than where I live and I think
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
there should be some sort of
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
notification when somebody purchases
 
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
property it's not ready in this bill but
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
please don't let it
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
die okay anyone else in the committee I
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
do have an additional question myself
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chair I put my hand
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
up at the last minute um I just wanted
 
00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:29.759 align:start position:0%
to say Yes um we I know that there's a
 
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
lot of um progress made with Watershed
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
plans in the lakes and there's it's a
 
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
really complicated issue so I really
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
appreciate um pursuing a non-legislative
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
solution and working with people because
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
it seems like you would be able to do a
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
lot more that way thank
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
you I have a additional question is uh
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
have you do you have thoughts on any on
 
00:14:57.389 --> 00:14:57.399 align:start position:0%
the mechanism of the creation of this
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
probably a form uh notification form
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:06.759 align:start position:0%
envision uh it being put forth by
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
created uh under the opes of Dees there
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
may be be a form on
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
de's uh website that the uh the Realtors
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
can go to a common form that and will it
 
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
be that they just be able to print it
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
off and or
 
00:15:33.069 --> 00:15:33.079 align:start position:0%
get get it from Dees in some way other
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
words Dees would
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
beate would create the form and
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
not uh the the
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
Realtors yeah I think the initial intent
 
00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
was to have it the the content come from
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
Dees but um and but Dees has a lot of
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
information about the responsibilities
 
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
of Shoreland owners um and actually
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
after this summer I've heard that you
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
know instead of just focusing on people
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
who are buying property new owners that
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
there needs to be education of all
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
owners um that you know if we just do
 
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
this education buyer by buyer we may be
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
only hitting a very small percentage of
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
people within that Shoreline protection
 
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
Zone um but I I know that in wolfb they
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
had um some Community meetings where I'm
 
00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
not I think it might have been Lake
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
winaki Association maybe New Hampshire
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
Lakes they hosted Community meetings um
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
with the town and I think as long as we
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
continue that discussion and work with
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire Lakes for example on
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
doing broader communication so that
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
anyone living within the shoreline
 
00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
protection Zone whether they're just
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
buying property or not has a greater
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
understanding of what their
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are so we this just FOC
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
Fus is on new buyers I'm not sure that's
 
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
going to be sufficient to get us where
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
we have to go on cyano bacteria Bloom
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
mitigation that we need to do something
 
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
broader to reach all residents and it
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
may not be something that is as
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
efficiently accomplished by the state as
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
much as it might be by local
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
communities um there was a bill um it
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
actually failed in the house I think by
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
one boat that representative wolf
 
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
brought that I think would be I I'd like
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
to see that bill come back where we add
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
Watershed zones to um a definition of a
 
00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
a special district for instance in my
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
town babusek lake has been plagued by
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms for years and years
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
and they've done so much um but if they
 
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
could form a special district with
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
Amherst that special district would have
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of power on education more than uh
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
you know one town doing it for their
 
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
half another town doing it for their
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
half or the state trying to do something
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
for a small like like
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
that responsibilities
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
and for doing stuff and responsibility
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
for creating
 
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
something uh needs to be determined is
 
00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:29.799 align:start position:0%
it will Dees have to make the
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
have to publish this thing or where does
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
people get stuff when uh you know when
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
you when you don't have
 
00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:42.039 align:start position:0%
responsibility established in the in the
 
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
in in the uh in the
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
statute you if if if nobody's
 
00:18:50.149 --> 00:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
responsible then if everybody's
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
responsible then nobody's responsible so
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's just make that a concern when you
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh as you go forward that someone has to
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
come out with somebody has to be
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for creating the
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
system well another Point too Mr chair
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of towns have adopted the
 
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:11.799 align:start position:0%
shoreline water quality protection act
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
as local ordinance and I think that's a
 
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
good tactic also because you're bringing
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement and education really down to
 
00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
that local level so when you talk about
 
00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility in some cases I would put
 
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
more um
 
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
reliability or trust on local
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
communities to have it to protect their
 
00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:34.549 align:start position:0%
communities to have it to protect their
own

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
ordinances um than having a state having
 
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
to focus in all of these communities for
 
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
education I I think if we can um
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
encourage more towns to adopt the
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
shoreline water quality protection act
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
as an
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
ordinance that would streamline
 
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:54.039 align:start position:0%
education a lot more than expecting
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
anyone else on the uh on this
 
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
issue one from the
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
audience uh I'll just take a show of
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
hands who I guess the recommendation
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
would will probably be uh not to not
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
recommend for future
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
legislation U how many let me he a s of
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
hands of those who would
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh y yes it would be uh
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
unanimous okay we want to move on now
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
to something that isn't going to be
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
1483 allowing subdivision regulations
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
supply any comments on uh
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh well this uh this is
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
the this is a lot this is a lot more
 
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.190 align:start position:0%
the this is a lot this is a lot more
complicated

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:21:23.789 --> 00:21:23.799 align:start position:0%
than going back
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
well this bill as it as it's written is
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
allows adoption of subdivision
 
00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
regulations to require water supply
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
studies determination of adequate water
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
supply for
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
reasonably uh anticipated future water
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
uses uh and minimum lawn lot size
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
minimum unlock private well testing
 
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
requirements and clarifies the
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
applicant's duty to pay
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
Associated costs so this is this is
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
actually an enabling
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
legislation to have the local
 
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
have uh this have the authority to
 
00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
require uh water
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
studies on uh on projects I I correct me
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
if anybody well it says require so can
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
we have some clarification the first all
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
right word is required okay well that's
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
that's first but just just as clear as
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
questions of just I'm just answering
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
right Mr chair as a member of the
 
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
planning board we did require water
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
studies traffic
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
studies all kinds of
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
studies and it I'm just um so it says a
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
letter P says require a water supply
 
00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
study in I guess in in accordance but
 
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
then it says um
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
May uh down at letter you know number
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
seven planning board May so maybe some
 
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.070 align:start position:0%
seven planning board May so maybe some
clarification

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
okay is that a response to the
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you Mr chair so if
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
you read the the statute 674
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
362 it says the subdivision regulation
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
which the planning board adopts May so
 
00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
all of those fall under the May category
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
they may they may require
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
it up y so are you saying now does
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
anybody know for a fact that they cannot
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
do this right now because it is my
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
understanding that studies that are
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
needed we would need to interpret I
 
00:24:21.149 --> 00:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
think we need to interpret the other uh
 
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
what is it
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
um 12 13 uh 14 regulations uh 14 uh
 
00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.110 align:start position:0%
um 12 13 uh 14 regulations uh 14 uh
clauses

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
clauses
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
that have that allow options and see if
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
any of them incorporate it because
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
there's 14 cases a one through or sorry
 
00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:38.919 align:start position:0%
a through n that say they may do this
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
and they may do that and these are
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
morea har thank you Mr chair I'm still
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
of the opinion I was when I wrote the
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
majority opinion that I think as
 
00:24:57.549 --> 00:24:57.559 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan says it can be
 
00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
done now uh there are towns that are
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
already got water testing in there I
 
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
know they've done water testing in
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
plasta where I come from um and then I
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
go back to um the uh commissioner
 
00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:14.919 align:start position:0%
Scott's comment that they had a whole
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
study committee on this and they
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't come up with a decision so if
 
00:25:20.909 --> 00:25:20.919 align:start position:0%
it ain't broke don't fix it so I'm
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
thinking it can be there towns are doing
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
it you don't need to enable them to do
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
it so I would not think legislation is
 
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
necessary thank
 
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
you any other comments on
 
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.070 align:start position:0%
you any other comments on
this

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr
 
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
chair so my understanding is that the
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
bill has been refiled I'm not sure if
 
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be the same text if the um
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor was able to um develop the bill
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
based on what came out of the hearing
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
but um in terms of studying it we are
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
still in the same place I think where we
 
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
were to begin with we heard that um
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
developers can come in and they can take
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
adequate water supply for granted so
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's a quote from what the sponsor
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
testified um in reality local planners
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
should be enabled to make sure that
 
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
there's water but I do believe we have
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
again really though this bill will be
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
refiled and there will be time and
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
see the Genesis of what happened that
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
brought the bill forward because there's
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
an incident and get that testimony thank
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
you Derby for a second thank you uh Mr
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
chair just a statement that um I don't
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
believe um that it is covered the only
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
coverage of um water usage talks about
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
health and safety
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
and the concern that um the
 
00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
um author of the bill mentioned was that
 
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
when you draw from an aquifer you're not
 
00:27:12.389 --> 00:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
um it's not localized it had aquafer
 
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
extends Beyond maybe the um the location
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
subdivision um and it can draw from uh
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
Farms it can draw from um it can draw
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
from other residences um and there uh
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
there's an impact that
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's a study is a is an impact study
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
that's required to understand what the
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
um what the surrounding uh you what what
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
the harm could be to other areas I don't
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
see that um that harm covered anywhere
 
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
in uh in this to um it really talks
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
about things like um fire suppression um
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
and uh playgrounds and things like that
 
00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
so I think this is I'm the reason that
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
this went to inim study I vot I um cast
 
00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:04.519 align:start position:0%
the the lone vote on um the opposing s
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
on the Democratic side for this um uh
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
but I um I think that something needs to
 
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
be done I think that when the um the
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
study that um representative harb
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
referenced came out there was a um there
 
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
was a statement um that that a need is
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
required um yes it's um the need is
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
unclear but a need is required and the
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
petitioner um the sponsor stated that
 
00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:34.039 align:start position:0%
they're that they're seeing problems uh
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
in their own community so this is not
 
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
this doesn't Force the hand of anyone
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
this enables um and it's not clear to me
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
that this enables in a bad way at all um
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
I'd say that um what is what would be a
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
bad uh what would be a negative impact
 
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
is if we um you know reduce the ability
 
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
to farm on adjacent lands by drawing
 
00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
down Aqua first or if we um impacted the
 
00:29:01.149 --> 00:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
property values of adjacent uh
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
properties because we didn't adequately
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
evaluate the um the impacts of adding
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know 50 50 houses in a subdivision
 
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
so um I I definitely believe personally
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.919 --> 00:29:19.590 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair um so
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
I have a question about what is the
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
constraints around scope of project so
 
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm reading this is it requires
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
a water supply study on every project
 
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
that comes into a community or is this
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
just constrained to larger projects so
 
00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
being a state rep from Salem we just had
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
a um huge uh planning board meeting last
 
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
night where they're looking at putting
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
in a casino where it's was the old Lord
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
and Taylor so that's a very large
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
project but then you know you may have
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
another the same night you could have
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
the same person coming in saying I'd
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
like to build a new house and I'd like
 
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
to do this following thing which is a
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
much different constraint but do both
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
have to do water
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
studies based on this bill so that's the
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:22.110 align:start position:0%
 
have

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.029 --> 00:30:24.039 align:start position:0%
representative question I have in my
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
mind or what I'm looking at is we're not
 
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
here to discuss the technical little
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
issues of any proposed bill it's just
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
should we recommend future legislation
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
or not so I mean all of us could come up
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
with amendments to the bill that may
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
have been presented uh but if my
 
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
representative to my right is correct
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
and it's already been refiled I'm still
 
00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:47.519 align:start position:0%
going to stick to the position I don't
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary because it's
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
already been refiled so ours is just a
 
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation so the sponsors already
 
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
refiled it then it's going to come back
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
to the committee and then we get a
 
00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
chance to review it and edit it and
 
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
amend it Etc so thank you one thing oh
 
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:08.919 align:start position:0%
go oh yeah I just uh it is has been
 
00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
refiled it's LSR 2025
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
0049 and it was refiled by
 
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.430 align:start position:0%
0049 and it was refiled by
representative

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
McGee but we wouldn't know we wouldn't
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
have access to what the uh no but it has
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
the same title as this bill
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I just want to
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
respond to um representative harb and
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's to say that a couple of things
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
have already come up on this bill that I
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
can see are concerns and I'm really glad
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
the representative um from Salem is here
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
and able to recommend raining in the
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
scope and how many houses is at one
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
house these are important things and
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
this is time we have to be more relaxed
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
when we weren't when we ordered you know
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
we voted to have this interim study at a
 
00:32:04.269 --> 00:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
time when we were moving along pretty
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
quickly yep all right let me let me step
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
back first of all let's just look at uh
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
what the uh the blurbs were and actually
 
00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:18.919 align:start position:0%
it was a it was an 11 to9 it was an 11
 
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
to9 vote out of this committee so to to
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
go to uh uh it refer to interm study the
 
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.909 align:start position:0%
go to uh uh it refer to interm study the
other

00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
that 11 was uh was uh interim study and
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
nine was for
 
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.750 align:start position:0%
nine was for
uh

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
or uh to uh to pass it to pass the Bill
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh that being said this bill has a
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
Genesis from the bill from the
 
00:32:56.629 --> 00:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
previous Set uh part of this session
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
310 and and that bill rather than
 
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.590 align:start position:0%
310 and and that bill rather than
talking

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
about uh just allowing subdivis
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
regulations concerning water supply
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
talked about allowing again the same
 
00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:17.559 align:start position:0%
thing it was
 
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
about requiring developers to secure
 
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.070 align:start position:0%
about requiring developers to secure
hydrology

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
hydrology
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
analyses certified that their adequate
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
water capacity and Pro pability when
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
building new
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
subdivisions it so that bill
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
was we that bill was was uh did not come
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
out of the was defeated by the committee
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh 310 well no and and that was on a 16
 
00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.710 align:start position:0%
uh 310 well no and and that was on a 16
to4

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
to4
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
vote uh that and basically we were told
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
that uh hydrology studies were
 
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.070 align:start position:0%
that uh hydrology studies were
very

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.629 --> 00:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh uh they were they were expensive to
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
start with very very expensive they were
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
talked about their testimonies to say
 
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to
 
00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.990 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to
do

00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
and the uh uh they could change at any
 
00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:24.919 align:start position:0%
time somebody uh in the Watershed or
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
somebody just down the block decides
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
that they're going to change uh going to
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
do something about their well to get a
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
get more flow which is many times it's
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
putting a a charge down and uh and
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
just and basically put it like an
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
explosive in the in the well not a big
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
explosive but enough to crack some more
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh channels that can cause an issue
 
00:34:59.950 --> 00:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
there basically it can change the
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh the water is to you can't you have to
 
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
drill a hell of a lot of holes to get on
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
real hydrology stud but that's that's
 
00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.790 align:start position:0%
real hydrology stud but that's that's
basically

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
what what was left at also it was a big
 
00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.790 align:start position:0%
what what was left at also it was a big
issue

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
around uh Workforce housing discussion
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
like that and issues
 
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
around uh checkerboarding if you do if
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
want someone wishes to uh
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
to bypass the regulation they
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
simply sell sell Parcels of land uh in
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
the they'll re subdivide so that you you
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
sell off the parcels so that when you go
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
into to
 
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
develop uh you don't you all you own is
 
00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:52.839 align:start position:0%
one or two parcels and other other could
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
other uh ownership rests for the rather
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
land rests without other uh rest with
 
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.630 align:start position:0%
land rests without other uh rest with
other

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
entities uh other
 
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
than so and then
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
finally in this bill as it exists now
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to
 
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
mention hydrological
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
testing but it it it doesn't really say
 
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.150 align:start position:0%
testing but it it it doesn't really say
what

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh government will ask for in there in
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
their regulations will they ask for
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
hydrological testing in
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
their uh in their regulations and will
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
this enable them to do
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
that that's always that's that is that
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
is also a question I understand that uh
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
there was we found that that was sent to
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
us by uh
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Kernan uh a model the model
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
ordinance that was developed by the uh
 
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.550 align:start position:0%
ordinance that was developed by the uh
uh

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
the commission that ex that looked at
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
this I guess back in 2008 and on the
 
00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:14.109 align:start position:0%
this I guess back in 2008 and on the
model

00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
model
 
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
ordinance uh it it's it there there are
 
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
some conflicting issues as to what what
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
the uh what this bill would be actually
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
be requ quiring uh the model ordinance
 
00:37:34.349 --> 00:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
talks about doing a hydrological testing
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
or doesn't even actually mentioned the
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
hydrological testing but uh uh on but on
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
larger the subdivisions not on for on uh
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
on and this one doesn't even mention
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
what the subdivision will be the the
 
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
model ordinance was sent to everyone
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
after during uh after
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
by uh Mr
 
00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
kman uh prior uh to our actually to our
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
executing that
 
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.349 align:start position:0%
executing that
bill

00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
so that's I think so that's kind of this
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
bill has a
 
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
history and one of my one of my large my
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
biggest concerns is that when we we
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
have you we here who deal with Dees
 
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
we know we know what where the uh Dees
 
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
we understand what their rules
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
are and we see how they apply those
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
rules and when you when you when you
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
allow this to go back into the
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
towns you now you we don't look at how
 
00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:52.839 align:start position:0%
they apply those rules and we've seen
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
and several times
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
where they they will will go they will
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
read the letter of the law and not
 
00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:03.079 align:start position:0%
understand how the rules are
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
actually implemented because you know
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
and they they've gotten into some
 
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
problems I think one of those had to do
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
with h $5,000 fines when someone takes a
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
tree down next to a next to a
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
Waterway so uh whereas that $5,000 fine
 
00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
in de's mind was used to force people to
 
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:31.640 align:start position:0%
to to to to do what they're supposed to
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
be doing to uh relative to the
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
uh basically large
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
developers so at any rate this is
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
there's a ISS there are issues with this
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
concern thank you for um outlining that
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
and bringing back some of the history um
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um the bill does have a history
 
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
his and looking at that vote now going
 
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
back to the first bill which was House
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
Bill 310 that vote came out of it um you
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
know there were many of us who wanted to
 
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
work on that bill but the sponsor wasn't
 
00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
available at the time and Brendan Kieran
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
came in and he testified that he was
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
working with her on this
 
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
so she came back with a better bill and
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
we sent it to interim study but that
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
better Bill we didn't really get a
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
chance to work on that with the sponsor
 
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
and Dees at the same time the first time
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
around so I do hope I'm glad to see that
 
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
this got refiled
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
and I think that we're going to stick to
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
recommending any uh other comments I
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
committee any comments by uh people in
 
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.390 align:start position:0%
committee any comments by uh people in
the

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
audience by the way what obviously you
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
must be here for the last
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
one okay sorry about that if I had known
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
that I'd have switched them
 
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.069 align:start position:0%
that I'd have switched them
around

00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair I did
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
make my position known I will say that
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
um I am worried of course about
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing I think it's the top
 
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
issue in the state um and we need to be
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
cautious to uh we need to be able to
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
encourage um uh developers to to build
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
we need houses um and definitely uh cost
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
prohibitive um uh forget the word you
 
00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
use but aquafer studies you know um
 
00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
would thank you hydrological studies
 
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
would be you know disruptive to that
 
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
regard and the term that's used in this
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
did um doesn't seem seem to be well
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
defined by Dees in terms of um a water
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
supply study so I do hope that when it
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
gets refiled um that that can be that
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
Clarity can be added so I I just wanted
 
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
well anyone
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
else if if not though I'll take a show
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
of hands
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
and who will vote who might wish to vote
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
for uh to not recommend for future for
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
future study but not
 
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
recommending and who would for recommend
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
study okay so it's it's so we are we are
 
00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
divided obviously so uh we at the end
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
we we'll take a vote on it and uh but as
 
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
I think I've been
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
discussing with the ranking member that
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh me my intent to put in the in any
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
write up when there's
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
disagreement it is I mean this is it it
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
is really uh we wish we should could try
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
to put give as much information
 
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
it's a a bunch guidance to the to
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
whoever is to to the Future basically
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
this is a note to ourselves or put it
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
this way it's a note to
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
yourselves uh because I will not be here
 
00:43:46.589 --> 00:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
but it's it's some of others but it
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh but the the pros and cons should be
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
in should be in what we write what we
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
what we write just to yeah the majority
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
said this ority but the minority said
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
that and that's that's reasonable in
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
this in instance I may get held for it
 
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
but what they going to do kick me off
 
00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.870 align:start position:0%
but what they going to do kick me off
the

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.910 align:start position:0%
the
committee

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
so so that that's where we'll go on this
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
one now for the last
 
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
three by the way have we finished on
 
00:44:32.829 --> 00:44:32.839 align:start position:0%
that okay Senate Bill
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
345 what is the
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
that okay we go go down the line
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
representative Darby representative FR
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
thanks um thank you Mr chair so I'm
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
serving on the um uh the study committee
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
for fishing game funding one of the
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
things that's um that came up from the
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
Department is how hard it is for fishing
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
game which is a self-funded uh agency to
 
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
balance their books when the legislature
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
plays games behind their backs with um
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
with fees and so um we we ask a lot of
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
of our um our agencies to um you know to
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
be fair to uh our residents um and also
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
to you know provide an attract Ive uh
 
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
environment to our visitors because
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
tourism is a um major um economic boom
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't U believe that the
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
legislature should be um directing the
 
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
fee structure to these uh self-funded
 
00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.870 align:start position:0%
fee structure to these uh self-funded
agencies

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:48.559 align:start position:0%
thanks representative R I agree with my
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
colleague from NASA
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
about you know how we're we kind of
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
nickel and dime through legislation what
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
our fees are going to be and I'd Like Us
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
in that regard if we could operate more
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
like a business and have the state parks
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
division really look holistically at
 
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
their budget how much money they need to
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
operate how much money they would want
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
to have to operate and knowing that we
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
want to give Granite Staters an
 
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
advantage we want to make it easier for
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
them to enjoy their own state but have
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
that be part of an overall um strategy
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
or or a business plan for setting the
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
fees because you know we set fees here
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
we just had a fee for retired military
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
and we we kind of have this Patchwork
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
that comes out of the legislature
 
00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
instead of really looking at it um from
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
a really strategic development business
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
business planning point of view because
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
we do want the fees to be
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient for the state park they
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
can't rely on really the general fund um
 
00:46:57.309 --> 00:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
when we're cutting down the revenue for
 
00:46:58.829 --> 00:46:58.839 align:start position:0%
the general fund we you know we're
 
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:01.079 align:start position:0%
cutting taxes we're getting rid of
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
dividends and interest um so this money
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
isn't growing on trees to support our
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
state parks and they're the ones that
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
know best of what they're going to need
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
to operate to the standard that they
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
that they need to operate and then if
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
they knew that the legislative intent is
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
to have an advantage for granted sters
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
they can that can then be part of an
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
overall free fee structure strategy um I
 
00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
also sometimes have concerns when you
 
00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:35.079 align:start position:0%
see numbers thrown out like 50% because
 
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
why not 40% why not 60% it's you know
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
it's arbitrary where if somebody really
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
sits down and and looks at the numbers
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
look at projections resources things
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
like that all the statistics that they
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
should be looking at anyway they could
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
come to a number that is more logical um
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
maybe it's higher maybe it's lower but I
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
I'd rather have them develop their fees
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
um justify them and then come to us to
 
00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
recommend them um rather than having us
 
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
without the knowledge or data they have
 
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
trying to make these decisions in a
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
you yeah she raise her hand first
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
then thank thank you Mr chair I'm um
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh I'm one of the sponsors on
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
the bill and um I think in gen you know
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
after giving it a lot of
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
thought I I do want to cut New Hampshire
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
residents break but I also agree with
 
00:48:43.549 --> 00:48:43.559 align:start position:0%
some of the other sentiments that I
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to complicate things anymore
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
I think we're already we are very much
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
piece you
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
know the danger is cut you know chopping
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
things up too much I think and making it
 
00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:56.799 align:start position:0%
more complicated I don't want to make it
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
more complicated for sure so um I
 
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
think I would be okay with with sort of
 
00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
putting this on hold for now and coming
 
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
at it from maybe a different approach if
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to work with me on it as
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
far as instead of having it something uh
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
giving New Hampshire residents a break
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
as far as fees because they're already
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
pretty low I think um doing something
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
else that is a sort of like maybe giving
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
them a a bigger window of opportunity
 
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
when it comes to signing up for
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
campsites something that does not
 
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
involve another fee structure change so
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
I'd be love to hear if uh New Hampshire
 
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
parks people have some thoughts on
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
thanks why don't I just keep going right
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
around like that of Representative ghoul
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
then representative Bale representative
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you uh Mr
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
00:49:59.230 --> 00:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
referring to what the former
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned about a
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
business structure uh I don't know if
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
this really fits in uh this seems to be
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
mainly about RS to get into a park for
 
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
example uh a group was trying to use the
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
state park at Hampton Beach and uh the
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
rates did go up fin uh substantially for
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
parking there for the
 
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
organization and uh this created a
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
problem for them and uh so they are
 
00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.309 align:start position:0%
problem for them and uh so they are
working

00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
to raise rates without affecting the
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
simple you know fee structure of getting
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
into a park so EV it seems to me they
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
are looking at it to get money somehow
 
00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:41.720 align:start position:0%
and uh but I also would since there are
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
a couple people here I would urge them
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
to get their permits going faster than
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.069 --> 00:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
been representative Vale and
 
00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:56.799 align:start position:0%
representative Ryan and representative w
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
well you're
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
chair so I just prepared some notes so
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
I'm just basically going to read them
 
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
there is a process for changing fees
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
that the um legislature has oversight on
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
and those go before the fiscal committee
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
and you know that we heard that the
 
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
director of New Hampshire state parks
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
the division has been addressing fee
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
changes at the park throughout Parks
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the state in fact one of the
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
um Parks is closed right now for to have
 
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements and upgrades and
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's um I believe Greenfield State
 
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
Park um and this is really a
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
vastly complicated issue um I think you
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
know as as far as the state parks
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
advisory Council goes which I serve on I
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
mean we do hear about the um the push
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
for hiring the issues with temporary
 
00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
workers that where they can't come
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily and then you balance that
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
with some of our
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
awardwinning um features we have a visit
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire campaign live free um and
 
00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:09.799 align:start position:0%
they left the Die part off which I think
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
is fantastic but there's a lot of moving
 
00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:15.799 align:start position:0%
parts and this is an Enterprise we are
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
trying to attract people to our state
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
and it's a really big picture so I think
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
for us to go in there and Tinker a
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
little bit at a time when there's a lot
 
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
of moving pirates with Federal money and
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know kind of sit back and see where
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
we are and see what kind of leg
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
legislative help is needed for state
 
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:41.559 align:start position:0%
parks and I think we can do
 
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair um as
 
00:52:52.109 --> 00:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
I've I think I've been on record before
 
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
saying I don't think it's really our
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
business or our job I think that if
 
00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to require the state parks
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
to um fund themselves then they need to
 
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:03.190 align:start position:0%
be able to do that without legislative
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:06.270 align:start position:0%
be able to do that without legislative
[Music]

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
interference representative
 
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.510 align:start position:0%
interference representative
representative

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:53:14.829 --> 00:53:14.839 align:start position:0%
wolf yes I think that um the um parks
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
department should be able to go to the
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee adjust their fees based
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
upon a thorough examination of what it's
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
costing them to run it I think just
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily saying it's 50% of what we
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
charge out of sters or something like
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
that it's no no basis for reality in
 
00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
that and so I would put this bill aside
 
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:43.480 align:start position:0%
leave the system we have but direct the
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
parks department to do a more thorough
 
00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
costs anyone
 
00:53:57.789 --> 00:53:57.799 align:start position:0%
else I know representative Donell you
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
did write the blur I was as if you wanna
 
00:54:03.549 --> 00:54:03.559 align:start position:0%
if if you want to say anything I'm not
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking you to
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
right okay so do you want to you want to
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
no Okay I uh I have I should put my I
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
got to put my three not my two cents my
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
three cents in
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh couple things first of all yeah yes
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
we uh
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
the the operate you oper as a state you
 
00:54:37.599 --> 00:54:38.789 align:start position:0%
the the operate you oper as a state you
are

00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
operationally the parks system is
 
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
operationally self-funded you're not
 
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
self-funded for uh Capital equip Capital
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
Improvements right that does come from
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
the general fund and also you there's
 
00:54:57.069 --> 00:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
also monies that you get outside of this
 
00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
outside that get get into the into the
 
00:55:04.349 --> 00:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
system uh yes you are an Enterprise or
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
supposedly an
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
Enterprise uh operation
 
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
however we and the uh in the uh in the
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislature seem
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
to uh use the park system and the as a
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh as a political tool
 
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
people are people my age come in oh I'm
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
I'm retired I need I I should get a
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
break I'm a citizen uh people come in
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh part of the specific groups they
 
00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
should get a break there all of these
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
things and and we
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
by legisl we as legislators will pass
 
00:55:56.069 --> 00:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
laws that force that to occur that that
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
is n made by a so that those decisions
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
aren't made by them that decisions is
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
us if I had my way anytime we we do
 
00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:11.799 align:start position:0%
something like that we ought to we ought
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
to reimburse the try the fund for
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh the uh operational
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
fund by from the general fund but that's
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
I'm I cannot affect that and I will not
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
be around to affect that the but to get
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
back to this bill
 
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
specifically this bill recognizes that
 
00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.750 align:start position:0%
specifically this bill recognizes that
other

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:42.039 align:start position:0%
states charge more for a specific for a
 
00:56:42.039 --> 00:56:43.390 align:start position:0%
states charge more for a specific for a
specific

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
fee to people from our state in other
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
words out of sters than they do to their
 
00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
local to their PE to their people we on
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
the other hand don't do
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
that so that if if I were a citizen and
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
I am a citizen I would sit back and say
 
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
hey wait a minute my government has
 
00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:09.789 align:start position:0%
hey wait a minute my government has
decided

00:57:09.789 --> 00:57:09.799 align:start position:0%
decided
 
00:57:14.029 --> 00:57:14.039 align:start position:0%
that those people get a break
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
here because they pay the same as me but
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
I don't get the same break over there so
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
I'm being treated as second class or at
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
least I'm not be my state isn't backing
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
me up so we as legislators will be
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
will'll constantly hear that hey I
 
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
wanted we I'm I'm a citizen I should
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
have I pay for this park yeah you do
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
prefer parts of it yeah I pay for this
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
park so why shouldn't I
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
have some a little bit of the fat and
 
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
get a little bit more pay a little bit
 
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
less get a discount for because I I
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
already paid at the at the at the tax
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
man or I already paid for this fee by
 
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
being a citizen
 
00:58:10.589 --> 00:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
so realize that that pressure is always
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.069 align:start position:0%
going to be
there

00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
and we should be doing something to be
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
able to or at some point and and I think
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
with with the with the we are ought to
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
be working with
 
00:58:33.789 --> 00:58:33.799 align:start position:0%
the park management to to have them s
 
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
kind of think ahead that take the
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
pressure off of the
 
00:58:44.349 --> 00:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
legislature that maybe
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
give show that you're playing that
 
00:58:50.029 --> 00:58:50.039 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about the
 
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
residence of New
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and not just and at least that
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
we that we are better than Massachusetts
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
and how they treat their
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
residents because their residents get a
 
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:10.839 align:start position:0%
break there so at any rate be aware of
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
that and uh because this is this issue
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
is not going
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
away now if you don't better to bite it
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
and better to to chew on it now and make
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
it make it come out with a way that
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
you're giving something to the
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
residents other than having it come
 
00:59:32.829 --> 00:59:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
legislature they able to raise the
 
00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
outstate reg oh they can do whatever
 
00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:38.109 align:start position:0%
outstate reg oh they can do whatever
they

00:59:38.109 --> 00:59:38.119 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
want but they decided they don't want to
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
so you know soon if if the wrong if you
 
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
if you come with an legisl you come if a
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
legislature is elected that you get a
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
majority say hey come on or if you get a
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
governor who go starts saying hey uh
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
what's you know uh you better you better
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
do this better to get out in front of it
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
this can we hear from oh I know if you
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
want you could respond I mean leave me
 
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
or say I mean we're not we're not saying
 
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
yeah you're here to talk if you want us
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
to respond yeah uh if I I'm not going to
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
say yes but if one want to ask folks
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah all
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
right all right first representative uh
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
Bale I just wanted to say that state
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
parks has worked with us on this bill
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
and we've spent a lot of time talking
 
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
about fees and I really appreciate that
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
you came today because we you know we I
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
understand the legislature wants more
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
information so perhaps knowing
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
the balance between visiting New
 
01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
money well good morning everybody uh my
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
name is uh Sean Hamilton I am the deputy
 
01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
supervisor of park
 
01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
operations um I've worked for state
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
parks for almost 15 years in varing
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
capacities starting at as a park crew
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
member at pway State Park when I was in
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
college so I've seen it at all um and um
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things that I would
 
01:01:33.309 --> 01:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
say is I think there's two separate
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
issues as as I see it and I do think yes
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
fees is part of the conversation but
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
really the complaint that I hear most
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
often is in regard to some sort of
 
01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:46.839 align:start position:0%
preferential um for New Hampshire
 
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
residents which I believe one of the
 
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
representatives brought up in uh in
 
01:01:53.269 --> 01:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
terms of maybe potentially a uh window
 
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
an earlier window for New Hampshire
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
residents versus out of residents um I
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
don't hear too many complaints about the
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
fees themselves to be quite honest with
 
01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
you it is more about being able to get
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
into a park uh when they when a
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
constituent wants to get into a park um
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
so for instance you know it's a Saturday
 
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
in July a visitor pulls up at 11:00 a.m.
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
it's a very busy day the park is full
 
01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
because of reservations are being at
 
01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
capacity uh and they're not able to get
 
01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
in and that upsets them and and I I
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
understand that um but what I would say
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
is that uh there are some systems in
 
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
place already such as our reservation
 
01:02:38.829 --> 01:02:38.839 align:start position:0%
system which would allow for these
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
visitors to be able to guarantee their
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
access into the park and prevent that
 
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
situation from
 
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
happening um in regards to the fees
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
there has been a uh systematic approach
 
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
at looking at the fee package over the
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
last two years uh and and it had
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
involved the state park advisory Council
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh and as well as uh the leadership team
 
01:03:03.549 --> 01:03:03.559 align:start position:0%
uh field staff it was compris comprised
 
01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
of many members of the division and uh
 
01:03:09.309 --> 01:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
we have taken it piece by piece looking
 
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
at the fee package starting with the
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
parking fees for the Sea Coast going to
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh camping fees uh and then obviously
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
dayuse uh fees are are the piece that we
 
01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:23.240 align:start position:0%
still have to
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
address without going too far into the
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
nuances and and I I'm not disagreeing
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
that there has to be some sort of um
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
compromise here in figuring something
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
out to prove residency versus
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
non-residency upon entrance of the park
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
is a little bit more complicated than
 
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
than you would think most of our Parks
 
01:03:46.029 --> 01:03:46.039 align:start position:0%
currently are per person rate which
 
01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:47.799 align:start position:0%
would mean that we would have to prove
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
The Residency of each individual uh in a
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
vehicle as they enter the park um not to
 
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
say that that's not possible but it's
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
not possible through our online systems
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
at the moment because that would require
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
us to integrate with the DMV database
 
01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
which I uh don't think would be allowed
 
01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
at this current time um so that would
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
significantly slow down the entrance of
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
the park um you would have to you would
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
have major traffic backups and
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
congestion and things like that so um
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
just want to point that part out I mean
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
one of our M the first impression that
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
someone has of in Hampshire state park
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
is when they get to the to the toll
 
01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
booth of the entrance gate and um we
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
want that to be seamless and smooth and
 
01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
so figuring out how to accomplish a
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
proof of residency while not impacting
 
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
that is probably part of the challenge
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
that we have to uh
 
01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
address I could go on but I won't unless
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
you want me
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.549 --> 01:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
questions know I note I did note that
 
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
bill uh there was uh there's a section
 
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
that says residency may be indicated by
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
state issued
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
identification utility or tax bills
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle registrations student
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
identification or vehicle license plates
 
01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
so so that was was addressed in actually
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
in Bill if you base it on the license
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
plate however you could potentially be
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
giving a resident discount to
 
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
out ofate people so if I came with five
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
people in my vehicle four of them were
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
from out of state and I based it solely
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
on the license plate they could also
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
receive that benefit so and and a good
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
and a good so a good followup uh to that
 
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
would in the in any future legislation
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
was simply putting in that uh uh an
 
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
unsworn falsification this you
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
know having someone in your vehicle who
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
is not uh uh uh a
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
resident should be declared if not it's
 
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
an un un unsworn falsification with a
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
fine of
 
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
that um just a a followup on that um
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
like we have a benefit as state reps we
 
01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
can go to the park for free um but so
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
for instance when I drive in yeah state
 
01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.710 align:start position:0%
for instance when I drive in yeah state
parks

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
parks
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
yeah is that I mean I've gotten into
 
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
so yeah it is yeah
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
price I think it depends on what it I
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
I've been to uh the beach every time I
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
went to Northampton uh Hampton Beach
 
01:06:49.559 --> 01:06:50.390 align:start position:0%
went to Northampton uh Hampton Beach
State

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
State
 
01:06:52.269 --> 01:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
Park should
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
be um anyway so we get benefit we come
 
01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
in they don't ask me if my mother is
 
01:07:04.589 --> 01:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire or whoever my guest
 
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
is that I'm taking with me so I assume
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's a similar sort of thing is that
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
right where you you don't ask those sort
 
01:07:15.069 --> 01:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
of questions of everybody in the car
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
right thanks um well at Hampton Beach
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
it's a parking fee so we only go off the
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
the driver of the vehicle at our parking
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
fee Parks we have a small number of
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
parks that are a parking fee that would
 
01:07:29.309 --> 01:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
be Hampton Beach South Wallace Sands
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
Livermore Falls um and obviously our
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
Meed parking is different the the rest
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
of the parks however are a per person
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
fee so in that particular instance if
 
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
you went to another Park that was a per
 
01:07:45.069 --> 01:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
else um I just not to be nitpicky but it
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
could happen the other way around too
 
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
where somebody has new somebody has
 
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts plate but they picked up
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
their grandmother on the way and in fact
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
this is Grandma's favorite Lake and she
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
lives in New
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just closing remarks I
 
01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:11.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate the discussion on this
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
today yeah I mean I don't think we're
 
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
boat than thank you Mr chair I want to
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
take advantage of you being here and uh
 
01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:28.839 align:start position:0%
how how is this state park doing like
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
what percentage is covered by fees of
 
01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
budget it's a very good question
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
um you know I I I would want to have
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
more detailed information in front of me
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you uh at the time but
 
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
but I I we have done well in in revenue
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
and I would attribute that to multiple
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
different things one uh the re
 
01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
reservation system uh that we have
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
implemented Ed uh the Davis reservation
 
01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
system which I think partly brought this
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
issue to light to be quite honest with
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
you uh in the fall of 2019 so prior to
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
co many think that we launched the
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
reservation system during Co we did not
 
01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
we launched it in the fall of 2019 at
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
madok State Park uh and that was a
 
01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
result of um large crowds the park was
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
constantly being full so so to manage
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
the resource not only to manage the
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
carrying capacity of the park but also
 
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
to manage the social
 
01:09:28.269 --> 01:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
uh carrying capacity of the park as well
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
because we need to manage responsibly
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
the resource but also at the same time
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
we need to preserve the visitor
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
experience which all of our visitors
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
have come to expect when they come to a
 
01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state park so we we
 
01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
launched that system it largely
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
successful there in accomplishing those
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
two goals but also what we found was
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
people were a lot more compliant in
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
terms of paying their fees U being
 
01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
honest coming up to the gate um and and
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
it was a much more pleasant experience
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
for everyone overall so during Co to gos
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
as well as the adhering to the co
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh and then from there we
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
kept it in place and what it has allowed
 
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
us to do is to capture Revenue uh that
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
we otherwise uh would have had more
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
difficulty uh collecting for various
 
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
reasons you know whether the park
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
Staffing is not at the level that it
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
that it maybe needs to be given our
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
seasonal Workforce although we have done
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
I believe a good job and and building up
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
that Workforce um and it has allowed us
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
to put uh capture points in terms of
 
01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue so for instance um we have
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
created uh online donation items for
 
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
unstaffed parks where we put signage up
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
with QR codes that someone can come up
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
to the their sign with their phone click
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
it and give us uh some fees for their
 
01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
use of the park there's not actually a
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
staff member there collecting that fee
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
um so so these different and also we've
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
launched an online donation page that's
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
just sort of a standalone page we've put
 
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
in some other uh nuances you know for
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
instance um if someone were to cancel
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
their camping reservation it sends them
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
a cancellation email and then it asks
 
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
them would you want to give a percentage
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
of your can your refund back to New
 
01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state parks as a donation do
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
you want to give the whole thing back um
 
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
so implementing these strategies has
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
helped us although at the same time our
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh expenses have in increased
 
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
significantly uh over the last uh 10
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
years uh we are working on an analysis
 
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
right now that shows that our uh
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
operating expenses and in the park
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
operations Bureau which is where I am
 
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
have about doubled um over the last 10
 
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
years so that that's significant and
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
also to to build up that robust
 
01:11:47.229 --> 01:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
Workforce that we're trying to
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
build we we had to make uh changes to to
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh to pay obviously some of that was
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
part of the 10% that was implemented but
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
also changes in the management structure
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
as well to implement some different uh
 
01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
classifications to to give us a a higher
 
01:12:07.229 --> 01:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
level of of management and uh Staffing
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
so hope that answers your question I
 
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
certainly could follow up with some more
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
detailed information after this if you
 
01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.030 align:start position:0%
detailed information after this if you
like

01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:12:18.189 --> 01:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
Darby thank thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
you for coming in you mentioned that the
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
what you've heard the most um most
 
01:12:25.149 --> 01:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
request for is some kind of prefer
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
ential um reservation um do you know if
 
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
other states are doing something similar
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
and how they um you know how they're
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
accomplishing that in terms of
 
01:12:39.149 --> 01:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
residency um some other states do uh
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
offer some Advanced window um how
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
successful it is I would leave that up
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
to them to to say uh what I would say
 
01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
though is it would be uh remarkably
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
difficult for us given the online you
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
know over 95% of our reservations are
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
made online without being able to
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
integrate into any sort of database that
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
would verify residency online that would
 
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
allow for someone to abuse the system so
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day it would come down
 
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
to a proof of residency
 
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
onsite um so yes we could implement it
 
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
but it it has the potential to be abused
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately that would not be
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
caught until the reservation holder was
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
on site arriving at at the park whether
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
that be for dayuse or
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
camping I'm also very conscious of the
 
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
you know our staff is comprised mostly
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
of high school college aged students as
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
well as
 
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.590 align:start position:0%
well as
retirees

01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
retirees
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
um conflict with uh visitors over
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
disagreements about how we are enforcing
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
said rules and policies is is highly
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
probable um and given that we are trying
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
to retain in whatever way we can the
 
01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
workforce so that we can provide the uh
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
recreational experience that that our
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
visitors expect uh I'm very cautious
 
01:14:06.629 --> 01:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
about about that and how we approach it
 
01:14:08.629 --> 01:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
not saying uh but that all being said we
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
are working uh with our reservation
 
01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
system vendor to see what type of
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
strategies we could Implement um to to
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
to make the ver to make a verif
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
your followup thank you Mr chair um I'll
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
just point out of course that another um
 
01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
another agency that brings a lot of
 
01:14:36.669 --> 01:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
residents from out of state um is
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing and of course
 
01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
there's out of state um differences
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
between resident and non-resident
 
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing licenses and every
 
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
state implements that so there is I
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
think there might be a way
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Harvey Poli lot
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
really quickly um just thank you for
 
01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
your comments and if you aren't in fate
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
or if you'd rather well we it sounds
 
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
like we're going to explore the window
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
idea as a there several people would
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
seem like they're interested in it but
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
if there's another Avenue that you'd
 
01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
like to explorer that gives New
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents some sort of break
 
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have to be a window doesn't
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
have to be a a a price break but maybe
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
there's something else you can think
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
of um I think we're willing to listen I
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have anything I'm
 
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.310 align:start position:0%
 
spot

01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
spot
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
um so if I could just respond um with
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
the fishing game um they're law
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency so they have access
 
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
to certain databases that we don't have
 
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
state parks but that doesn't mean that
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
we couldn't coordinate I'm just I wanted
 
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
to throw that out there um in terms of
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
um do I have any ideas you know I think
 
01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day uh I working
 
01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
collaboratively is certainly the way to
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
go and and not only with um you know
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
other members of the state parks team as
 
01:16:02.910 --> 01:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
well because there are there are a lot
 
01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
of different ideas from all different
 
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
aspects of our operation um the the the
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
window uh we we would have to we' have
 
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
to talk about um how that is implemented
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
and where it is implemented however I I
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
certainly think it's possible and I'm
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
sure that there are some other ideas
 
01:16:23.229 --> 01:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
there's also been a lot of research uh
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's been active from our staff you
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
know given this legislation of looking
 
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
at other state park systems and other
 
01:16:32.669 --> 01:16:32.679 align:start position:0%
entities throughout the country to see
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
what they're doing so I think uh if if
 
01:16:37.470 --> 01:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
there was a collaborative approach where
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
we could share some of that information
 
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
and and and maybe have a a sort of back
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
nice representative wolf did you have a
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
I saw you
 
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
reaching no I think he uh answered Mr
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
Darby's comment fishing game you do have
 
01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
get okay is there any other questions or
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
comments thank you very
 
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%

uh of the
 
01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
committee this just a just a show of
 
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
hands before we exact in 10 minutes uh I
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
would uh let's see who would the vote
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
legislation okay and for
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh and I will I will vote in the
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
negative on that simply because I want
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
to make certain that we get in into the
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh the what will be written on this
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
that this is the issue of uh non of the
 
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
diff the disparity between the treatment
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
of uh of our our
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
residents by New Hampshire and and uh
 
01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
the residents of other states their
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
treatment by their government ex does ex
 
01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
does is an issue that should be at least
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
discussed it sounds like it is going to
 
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.189 align:start position:0%
discussed it sounds like it is going to
be

01:18:38.189 --> 01:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
but just want to get it on the record so
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
I'll vote

01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
avenues um potentially non-
 
01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
legislatively to ensure that homeowners
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%

01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
adhere to the Shoreline water quality

protection act um I also believe that um
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
there are other ways also to expand that
 
01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
notification to include non new buyers
 
01:35:18.669 --> 01:35:18.679 align:start position:0%
like people with existing property so
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%

01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
second you wish to speak to your motion
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair very briefly I um
 
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
stated most of what I wanted to say
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
during the work session but I think this
 
01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
is uh an important bill to um some
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
communities that are experiencing
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
um water challenges and um with some
 
01:38:29.589 --> 01:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
revisions um to make sure that it
 
01:38:29.599 --> 01:38:31.189 align:start position:0%
revisions um to make sure that it
doesn't

01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
disincentivize um uh building affordable
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
housing and um uh and having
 
01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
well-defined terms I think this a a
 
01:38:41.709 --> 01:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
well-crafted piece of legislation could
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
us to speak to your second yes thank you
 
01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um as mentioned in the work
 
01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:53.679 align:start position:0%
session this legislation's already been
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
refiled the LSR is already at OS so I
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
think that we need to support it and
 
01:39:01.870 --> 01:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
have a vetting of it when it comes
 
01:39:06.109 --> 01:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
again we uh is there anyone else who
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak to the motion
 
01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:13.589 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak to the motion
representative

01:39:13.589 --> 01:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
wolf if the legislation has already been
 
01:39:19.709 --> 01:39:19.719 align:start position:0%
filed what is the purpose of moving this
 
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
forward you're going to have two
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:59.229 --> 01:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
sure actually we don't know what's in
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
Bill okay that's first of all and but
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
also it's been the tradition that we do
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're doing and it's really
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
what we're what we are doing is just
 
01:40:19.390 --> 01:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:27.030 align:start position:0%
 
repes

01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair I do
 
01:40:31.629 --> 01:40:31.639 align:start position:0%
think it's a representative w a matter
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
of decorum so looking forward to the
 
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
hearings in January and February on that
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
next bill we don't want to look back and
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
have part of the hard work be that the
 
01:40:47.470 --> 01:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
committee didn't think we should pursue
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
further legislation and that's going to
 
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
come out in chronological order so right
 
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
now we're voting
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
and then the legislation will come out
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
in December and that's the other way
 
01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:02.199 align:start position:0%
around so that's why we're going to
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
recommend or not recommend depending on
 
01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:07.830 align:start position:0%
recommend or not recommend depending on
the

01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
motion is it representative run for a
 
01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
second time yeah um just to address your
 
01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
wolf interm study the outcome doesn't
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
really dictate any action on the
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
legislation we could vote to not
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
recommend a bill and it could still get
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
filed we could vote to recommend and it
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't get filed so it's pretty much
 
01:41:32.589 --> 01:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
what the chair said it's a kind of a
 
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
note to ourselves just kind of dotting
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
the eyes and crossing the tees but our
 
01:41:41.070 --> 01:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
vote our decision doesn't have any
 
01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:45.910 align:start position:0%
vote our decision doesn't have any
actionable

01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
outcome anyone else represent harb thank
 
01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
you um even though it's a note to
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
ourselves I'm going to make my myself a
 
01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
note that I'm not in favor of this
 
01:41:57.070 --> 01:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
legislation so I'm going to vote against
 
01:42:00.189 --> 01:42:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%
just yes thank you um I'm voting against
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
it I do know that engineering studies
 
01:42:10.639 --> 01:42:11.669 align:start position:0%
it I do know that engineering studies
are

01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:11.679 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
permitted um already planning boards can
 
01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh request an engineering study to be
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
paid for by the applicant H and U
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
hydrological studies includ flow rate is
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
part of that I remember uh some
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
subdivisions that came forward in Tilton
 
01:42:33.589 --> 01:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
um so also impact fees is part of the uh
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
subdivision planning process already so
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
I think it's already covered so I'm not
 
01:42:43.589 --> 01:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
thanks and I will I will be voting
 
01:42:49.870 --> 01:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
against it because I think the authority
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
is already there in uh to allow this to
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
be to be done
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
and I think this is opening up a can of
 
01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
worms that uh we may find that is it
 
01:43:07.149 --> 01:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
causes more difficulty uh in the future
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
than than we have
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
now would anyone else wish to speak on
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%

Senate Bill

345 there a second second second by
 
01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
anyone uh speak on your on your motion
 
01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you Mr chair um as we heard
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
in testimony the fees are being reviewed
 
01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
and there's quite a bit of capital
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
Improvement going on at the same time um
 
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
wage increases and as we heard today um
 
01:45:23.229 --> 01:45:23.239 align:start position:0%
there's quite a bit of confusion about
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
um what exactly we would be looking at
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
um so for that reason I will be voting
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
to not recommend State Park Feast to be
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%

01:45:44.589 --> 01:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
on I believe that we ought to be leaving
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
it in the hands of the
 
01:45:52.990 --> 01:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
um parks department rather than dict
 
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
ating from on high what the fees should
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
be they know what their costs are and
 
01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
they know how to best manage paying for
 
01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:02.390 align:start position:0%
they know how to best manage paying for
those

01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
