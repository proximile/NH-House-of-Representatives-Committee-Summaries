00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
good afternoon we'll open the work
 
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
session on a house a Senate bill 128.
 
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
relative to the payment for legal
 
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
services for persons involuntarily
 
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
admitted for mental health services
 
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.390 align:start position:0%
admitted for mental health services
the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
committee that this went to Judiciary
 
00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 align:start position:0%
voted it out 17-3 was on the regular
 
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
calendar there was a floor amendment
 
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
that was offered that was defeated
 
00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
by a vote of 182 to 201
 
00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
and the house voted on the bill and the
 
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
house supported the bill by a vote of
 
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.790 align:start position:0%
 
as

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
all right is there someone
 
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
here that's uh was one of the sponsors
 
00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
that would like to speak to the bill
 
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
I see representative Lynn just itching
 
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
all right seeing nobody that sponsored
 
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
the bill will recognize representative
 
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.770 align:start position:0%
the bill will recognize representative
Lynn

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
Lynn
 
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
to speak and I guess was this your the
 
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
amendment was something right that's
 
00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 align:start position:0%
what I but the bill obviously came to us
 
00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 align:start position:0%
from the Senate um and so at the as as
 
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
representative Smith indicated that
 
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
what's before you now is the bill
 
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
without any Amendment as as uh as
 
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 align:start position:0%
proposed by the Senate
 
00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:16.790 align:start position:0%
proposed by the Senate
um

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
and I guess I
 
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
I think the bill was uh was intended to
 
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
occur to uh to accomplish two things
 
00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
I the first part I think is and I I you
 
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
know uh would ask representative Smith
 
00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
when she speaks if she has a different
 
00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 align:start position:0%
view but I don't think she does the
 
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
first part I think is really
 
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
um was sort of non-controversial in the
 
00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
sense that the idea was to
 
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 align:start position:0%
transfer payment
 
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
uh uh from the Department of Health and
 
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
Human Services which although the
 
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
current law doesn't say
 
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
that it's the Department of Health and
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
Human Services that is supposed to pay
 
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
for these services at least it doesn't
 
00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 align:start position:0%
say so in this statute now whether
 
00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
there's some other statute that says
 
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
that that was never something that came
 
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
up but but this statute at least doesn't
 
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
say that it's supposed to be the
 
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
that pays but that's been the practice
 
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
apparently for some time that they pay
 
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.189 align:start position:0%
apparently for some time that they pay
for

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
um the services as I understand it and
 
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
the the idea of the of the Bill of that
 
00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 align:start position:0%
part of the bill was to transfer that
 
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the judicial Council
 
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
which I think made sense since they pay
 
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
for services for Indigent Council in a
 
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
variety of contexts and you know why I I
 
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
mean why not why not consolidate that in
 
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
one place that that part I think seemed
 
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
to make sense
 
00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 align:start position:0%
um I know uh Mr sample from the judicial
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
Council I think would have a might have
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
a view that if we were going to do that
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
maybe that requires some reallocation of
 
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
resources from the Department of Health
 
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
and Human Services to the judicial
 
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
Council and it and again if that's if
 
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
it's simply going to be sort of a
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
transfer that may make sense also the
 
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
second part of the bill
 
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
um is the part that
 
00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 align:start position:0%
um that was the amendment was adopted
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
was directed to and that is that this
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
part of the Senate this aspect of the
 
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
Senate bill would eliminate the
 
00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 align:start position:0%
responsibility of someone who is uh
 
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
appointed counsel in an involuntary
 
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
commitment proceeding whether it's the
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
temporary hearing the the so-called
 
00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 align:start position:0%
three-day hearing
 
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
um that had the hearing has to be held
 
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
in three days or the more permanent one
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
that can result in a in a person being
 
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed for a longer
 
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
period of time to to eliminate the
 
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
responsibility that a person has to if
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
if they're able to afford to uh to
 
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
reimburse the state that they do so
 
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
um that's the part that I had a real
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
problem I didn't understand since the
 
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
law has been that way since 1986.
 
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.909 align:start position:0%
law has been that way since 1986.
um

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh you know on that point I guess my
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
quest really quite real question is what
 
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
has changed why should that should we
 
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
take that responsibility away uh that
 
00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
has existed since 1986.
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
um you know that that went to the house
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
and I lost uh on on that side of it so I
 
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
guess that the question then that I
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
think the committee needs I would
 
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
suggest the committee needs to to
 
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
consider is
 
00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
is it worth
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
is it work is it important enough to
 
00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 align:start position:0%
change the payment responsibility from
 
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
Services to the uh judicial Council
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
that is is that worth
 
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
um uh giving up the responsibility of
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
someone who can who is able to afford to
 
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
reimburse the state the uh the imposing
 
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
upon that person the ability the
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do so and personally I
 
00:06:59.809 --> 00:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
would say that it's not worth it and
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
that you uh if you know if if that's the
 
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
trade-off I would just my recommendation
 
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
would be simply to itl the bill or maybe
 
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
have some maybe retain it for some
 
00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259 align:start position:0%
further some further work on it but I I
 
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
just don't
 
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
um understand the changing that um
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
changing that responsibility the the
 
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
last thing I I know that representative
 
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759 align:start position:0%
McGuire has talked about a proposal
 
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
member which I don't know whether he's
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
it says I don't know whether he's going
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
to offer or not but it's it's very
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
similar to the amendment that I offered
 
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
with one change and that is it would
 
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.469 align:start position:0%
with one change and that is it would
remove

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
remove
 
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of a person who could
 
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
afford to reimburse the state it would
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
remove that responsibility if the person
 
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
was not in fact involuntarily committed
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
and I guess what I would say about that
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
is I I
 
00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
like that better than the Senate version
 
00:07:58.969 --> 00:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
of the bill if it it's I I still have
 
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
one aspect of it but I do think it's an
 
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
improvement on the Senate version of the
 
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
bill because at least imposes or some
 
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
responsibility to repay the difficulty I
 
00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:09.419 align:start position:0%
have with this and and I should say in
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
all fairness this would be consistent
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
with what the law is now with regard to
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
criminal cases if the if a defendant is
 
00:08:19.129 --> 00:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
acquitted if defendant gets appointed
 
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
counsel and is acquitted the defendant
 
00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
does not have the obligation to
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
reimburse the state that was adopted
 
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
about three years ago I think or four
 
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
years ago maybe that changed
 
00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
the problem I have with with that
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
philosophy is it seems to me I mean in
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
some sense I I can understand the
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
argument of fairness well if you if you
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
were charged with a crime and you didn't
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
commit it or if you were if you were
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
involence committed and you and you
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
weren't really you know you shouldn't
 
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
have been involuntary committed why
 
00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
should you have to pay for a lawyer
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I I get that on the other on the
 
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
other side of that is if you're charged
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
with a crime or you're involuntarily
 
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
committed and you are you know an upper
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
middle class or middle or maybe middle
 
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
class or upper middle class or a wealthy
 
00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
person and you hire your own lawyer and
 
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
you're acquitted or you're not
 
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed you don't get to
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
bill the state
 
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
for for the chart for your lawyers
 
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
charges even at the rate that uh you
 
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
know the lower rate that would be paid
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
for this so why why is that uh why is
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
that fair I guess I
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it is and so that's
 
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
that's my problem with that but you know
 
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm always one to never let the uh
 
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
the uh the perfect become the enemy of
 
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
the good and so I if if that Amendment
 
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
were offered
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
um it's I think it's an improvement on
 
00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:44.459 align:start position:0%
the bill as it is right now
 
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:47.700 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions for
 
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire Dan Maguire
 
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:57.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:09:59.449 --> 00:09:59.459 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
um do we know how much money is changing
 
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
from one bill to the next I mean how
 
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
many cases are there where
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
um currently the person's paying on
 
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
their own and they're now going to be
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
paid by the state the you know that
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's well there's there is a fiscal
 
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
note which says that the total cost is
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
about 1.5 million dollars and I think my
 
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
understanding and I you know if they're
 
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:29.459 align:start position:0%
um if there's somebody who has more
 
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
information on the details of this then
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
they should test but my understanding is
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
that that 1.5 million is not just
 
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
for the Emergency admissions it's for
 
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.090 align:start position:0%
for the Emergency admissions it's for
all

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
the admissions uh the emergency ones may
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
may very well be a large part of that
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
but but it's for all admissions in terms
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
of how many cases we did have
 
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
information on that
 
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:53.870 align:start position:0%
information on that
um

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know I want to say
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
a year I could be I somebody I just I've
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
forgotten off the top of my head but I
 
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.970 align:start position:0%
forgotten off the top of my head but I
thought

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:03.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
okay something like that so um but you
 
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
know one of the things that we did not
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
receive any information on that I that
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
maybe there'll be somebody here that can
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
give you this information because I
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
think it would be important is
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
although we know that the Department of
 
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services has a contract
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
and has been paid with some attorneys I
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
guess and has been paying these costs
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we don't know we
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
didn't receive any evidence on is what
 
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
effort the department has been making to
 
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
try to get reimbursement to or to find
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
out you know who is eligible who was
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
able to reimburse and who was not I
 
00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:41.459 align:start position:0%
don't we don't have any information on
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
that and I think that would be something
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
that would be important
 
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
would the under this procedure
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
um with the same attorneys just sort of
 
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
move over and get their check from the
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
judicial Council instead of HHS or is
 
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
they gonna have to find a whole new set
 
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
of attorneys who are inexperienced with
 
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.110 align:start position:0%
of attorneys who are inexperienced with
this

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
I would think if the if the if the only
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
thing that transfers is just you know
 
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
who the check is issued by I would think
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
that there would be not be a reason for
 
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
attorneys to you know to care and so
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
they would presumably continue but if
 
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
there's some maybe Mr sample could could
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
address that if there's some other
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
aspect that I'm not thinking about that
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
you know would make a difference in
 
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
attorney and an attorney's willingness
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
to to accept those cases that that that
 
00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
that would be something he would have to
 
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
I'm puzzled by the um
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
of the 10-year period between 2011 20-21
 
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:48.620 align:start position:0%
there was an average of
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
2449 iea cases filed in the Circuit
 
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.329 align:start position:0%
2449 iea cases filed in the Circuit
Court

00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:53.339 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
that was and then on the the rest of it
 
00:12:59.210 --> 00:12:59.220 align:start position:0%
it seems to act as if that is annual
 
00:13:02.569 --> 00:13:02.579 align:start position:0%
rather than a 10-year that's like 60
 
00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:05.459 align:start position:0%
people at 60 some people a day
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
it would make more sense if that total
 
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
would 10 years it's about 250 people a
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
year but to think this
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
2449 people a year in voluntary
 
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
admission I would believe it would be
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
for 10 years but 60 some people a day
 
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
right I that's that's a very good number
 
00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:32.810 align:start position:0%
right I that's that's a very good number
right

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
six people a day still that's more than
 
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
we have places to put them
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman any comments on the fiscal
 
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.250 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman any comments on the fiscal
note

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
note
 
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
2449 per year
 
00:13:53.329 --> 00:13:53.339 align:start position:0%
over the 10-year period that sentence
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
could have been written a little bit
 
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.370 align:start position:0%
could have been written a little bit
better

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
no wonder we're running out of places
 
00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
because we don't have 2400 openings a
 
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
day a year rather
 
00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:11.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative Carol McGuire did you
 
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
well while we're talking about the
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I would be interested in
 
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
they mentioned that the judicial Council
 
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
would need more people in more space and
 
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:27.500 align:start position:0%
my question is how much effort does the
 
00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
HHS spend on managing this effort and
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't those funds be moved along
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
official Council so they may be able to
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
answer that question okay representative
 
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
McGuire you got another question yeah
 
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
just to respond to representative Weiler
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
I was once on division three and well
 
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
twice and what I remember from the New
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital was that the average
 
00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
length of stay was only 10 days
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
so it's surprising how short that is
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
because there's some people who live
 
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
there permanently right so so for
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
everybody else they basically are
 
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
committed they get their medications set
 
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
up and they leave you know so so it
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
isn't surprising to me that that there's
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
Lynn representative Griffin well it's
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
kind of a general question I don't know
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
what the representative Lynn can answer
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
to someone else Kim
 
00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
but I think pretty much the judicial
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
money comes out of the state budget and
 
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering whether the Health and
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
Human Services money comes out of the
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
federal budget
 
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
I do not know the answer to that
 
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:47.810 align:start position:0%
I do not know the answer to that
question

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
Lynn I I do have one so the financial
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit to determine whether someone
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
is able to pay this fee who chases that
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
down or someone doesn't fill it out
 
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
do you know the impact of that problem
 
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
right well you know that's why the
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
amendment both both the amendment that I
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
propose that failed and now
 
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's is worded I
 
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
think pretty carefully it was designed
 
00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
based upon my discussions with judge
 
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
king to see you know one of his points
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
was look very often it's the case that
 
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
so when somebody's brought in in in a in
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
a situation with it where there's
 
00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:34.019 align:start position:0%
they're being sought to be involuntarily
 
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
admitted they're in a high state of
 
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
agitation and it's going to be very hard
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
to get them to fill out a financial
 
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
affidavit which is completely
 
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.470 align:start position:0%
affidavit which is completely
understandable

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
understandable
 
00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:45.860 align:start position:0%
um so I it was worded in a way to say
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
that that if if the if the court can't
 
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
get that information at the time it can
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
it should appoint counsel you know so
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the thing the right
 
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
thing to do and then refer the matter to
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
the uh to the office of Cost Containment
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
uh for them to conduct and and then you
 
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
know for them to get the person to fill
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
out the financial affidavit after the
 
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
back presumably after they've calmed
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
down and are in a better position to
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
provide that information and then on
 
00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:14.459 align:start position:0%
that basis they can determine whether
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
the person uh is able to reimburse and I
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
and again I think that there may be
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
there may be a number of cases where the
 
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
person can't will not be able to
 
00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:26.819 align:start position:0%
reimburse and they the the OCC would
 
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
then tell the court you know you should
 
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
just waive it because it's not it's not
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
worth it in this case to try to collect
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
so we like spending a hundred dollars to
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
try to get ten percent well I you know I
 
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
think that's what you know office and
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
Cost Containment that's something that
 
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
they do and they've been doing that in
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
the criminal context for a long time uh
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
they have some extra private I did talk
 
00:17:54.169 --> 00:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
to Charlie arlinghaus in connection with
 
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
drafting the amendment
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
um and that that is something that they
 
00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
have some expertise in and have been
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
doing for a while so you know if they I
 
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:04.700 align:start position:0%
think if they conclude
 
00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
that it's not going to be worth it to
 
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
try to collect this money in this
 
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
particular case then they'll say they'll
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
tell the court that but
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
you know I think one of the things that
 
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
that I think
 
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
is is important to sort of think about
 
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
in this context is
 
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should have the
 
00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term this the sort
 
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
of you know discrimination of low
 
00:18:33.169 --> 00:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
expectations that everybody that is
 
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
involved in one of these involuntarily
 
00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:37.220 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
emergency admissions is sort of you know
 
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
a person that uh is that's their life
 
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
they're going to be in this forever
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
they'll never be able to repay why are
 
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
we bothering to do that
 
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
um that kind of low expectation
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
maybe that's true for some subset of
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
them and maybe it's even a substantial
 
00:18:59.810 --> 00:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
subset of of those people but I don't
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
think it's everyone and I don't think we
 
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
should be thinking in those terms maybe
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
there will be a subset of people who
 
00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:09.539 align:start position:0%
will who have had you know a terrible
 
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
mental health uh trauma and will be
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
treated and get over it and when the
 
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
bill comes from the depart from the
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
office of Cost Containment they'll pay
 
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
the bill because they that's the right
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
thing to do and they'll and you know and
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should sort of assume
 
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
that that will not
 
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
be the case
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
even though I screwed up the math
 
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.970 align:start position:0%
even though I screwed up the math
problem

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
since this does come to finance I'm
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the source of funds likely to
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
change I think you pointed that out
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
if we need to find out if somebody's
 
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
here from HHS what the percentages
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
that's paid is federal and state because
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council some of us know
 
00:19:59.210 --> 00:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
always comes to fiscal
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
for their funds and those funds always
 
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
end up being General funds so are we
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
switching from maybe 50 percent
 
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
Federal 50 percent General to 100
 
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.029 align:start position:0%
Federal 50 percent General to 100
percent

00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
General funds that's something the
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
finance committee needs to weigh in on
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions you're off
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
the hook for a few minutes but stay
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
around I will thank you
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chair good afternoon Mr
 
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.130 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chair good afternoon Mr
chair

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
um it is
 
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
well that's true I wasn't doing
 
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
everyone's title
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
I mean if I were going to really
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the most important people I
 
00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:57.260 align:start position:0%
would be acknowledging Mr Hoffman
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
and I think all of you on the committee
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
would agree with me on that
 
00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:03.190 align:start position:0%
would agree with me on that
um

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
I love the fact that I'm back here at
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
the finance committee where my heart has
 
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
always been and I know as you all know
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee does not get
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
involved in policy it never has it only
 
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
gets involved in the money and you'll
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
all with that blushing agree with that
 
00:21:25.679 --> 00:21:27.230 align:start position:0%
all with that blushing agree with that
um

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
I think there are a couple of points
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
that I would like to mention at the very
 
00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:33.169 align:start position:0%
that I would like to mention at the very
beginning

00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
we are not talking here about anyone who
 
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
this is not a criminal proceeding
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
and I think we have to keep that in mind
 
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
if they need to be changes in criminal
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
proceeding let's do it in judiciary or
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
criminal justice but not in this bill
 
00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:00.539 align:start position:0%
this is an involuntary
 
00:22:00.539 --> 00:22:03.470 align:start position:0%
this is an involuntary
commitment

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
for a mental health crisis
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
I know and I think you all know
 
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
as you have gone over the budget and
 
00:22:23.649 --> 00:22:23.659 align:start position:0%
looked at how Cost Containment works
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
that it frequently costs the state much
 
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
more per case
 
00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:33.419 align:start position:0%
with all due respects for the
 
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:35.900 align:start position:0%
commissioner of administrative Services
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
costs the state much more to try to
 
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.770 align:start position:0%
costs the state much more to try to
collect

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:41.780 align:start position:0%
collect
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
than what they receive
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
for years there has been serious
 
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether in fact we
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
should be continuing the Cost
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
Containment effort because we're not
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
reaping the benefits that we should
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
and so I think you have to keep that in
 
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.210 align:start position:0%
and so I think you have to keep that in
mind

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
it's very very important
 
00:23:12.289 --> 00:23:12.299 align:start position:0%
the person who is the principal here
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
is in a mental health crisis
 
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
they have not chosen
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
to ask the state to provide them with
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
Services they have not asked the state
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
to make expenditures on their behalf
 
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
for reasons that are essential for their
 
00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
well-being you know the well-being of
 
00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:45.020 align:start position:0%
the community they are being
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed
 
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:53.780 align:start position:0%
as far as the core part of the bill
 
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
a given it is not at all
 
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
um changed in any way so what we're
 
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
talking about here
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
is who is going to pay
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the point that both
 
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.890 align:start position:0%
and the point that both
um

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
chairman Wyler and representative Dan
 
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
McGuire have made about where is this
 
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
money coming from
 
00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:27.059 align:start position:0%
is an absolutely legitimate point is it
 
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
going to come out of the general fund or
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
is it going to come out of federal funds
 
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:33.830 align:start position:0%
is it going to come out of federal funds
um

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.149 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note I think you will find
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
that unlike many fiscal notes this
 
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal note really isn't
 
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
very clear it doesn't give us the
 
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
information that we need to make an
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
informed decision
 
00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:01.430 align:start position:0%
informed decision
and

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
this room or the room across the hall
 
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is not the place to begin to
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
change the policy of what we're going to
 
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
be doing with involuntary
 
00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.110 align:start position:0%
be doing with involuntary
uh

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.090 align:start position:0%
uh
commitments

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:16.100 align:start position:0%
commitments
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
if I had my druthers and I'm not on
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
finance much to my
 
00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:24.299 align:start position:0%
sadness although it does mean that I can
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
be with my current chair and that's been
 
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
delightful we've done very well together
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
um it would be to either
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
pass the Senate bill as it came
 
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
from the Senate to the house and from
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
the house to the finance committee
 
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
because that's what it is or
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
itl the bill and say we're just going to
 
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
leave things
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
the way they are and in time find the
 
00:25:59.330 --> 00:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
kind of information we need to make an
 
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.470 align:start position:0%
kind of information we need to make an
informed

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
informed
 
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.450 align:start position:0%
informed
decision

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.470 align:start position:0%
decision
um

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
I I that to me just seems to be the most
 
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
responsible thing that you can do now
 
00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:12.299 align:start position:0%
there are people here
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
who unlike me who just get I'm a gadfly
 
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
in this you know I sit in the
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
legislature and I make these
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
pronouncements there are people who
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
actually do the work
 
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
and you know and they're sitting behind
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
me and they might have a very different
 
00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
view of it
 
00:26:27.779 --> 00:26:29.149 align:start position:0%
view of it
but

00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
we have a severe problem in this state
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
and we all agree
 
00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:36.380 align:start position:0%
with mental health
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
and it's not just in this state it's
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
across the country with mental health
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
crises we're talking about a mental
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
health crisis in this
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
I this isn't the time I I have no no
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
standing all the representative McGuire
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
was kind enough to share his
 
00:26:57.059 --> 00:26:59.630 align:start position:0%
was kind enough to share his
Amendment

00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
um with me he is not introducing so
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
obviously I can't talk about it now but
 
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
if you were to look at it seriously I
 
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
would love to be able to come back and
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
address a couple of points in that but
 
00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:12.230 align:start position:0%
address a couple of points in that but
meanwhile

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
meanwhile
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
um I think you can either
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
score some
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
points with the Senate and say okay
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
we'll accept the Senate version and then
 
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
that gives you the opportunity to say
 
00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:27.299 align:start position:0%
okay we accepted the Senate version on
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
this so now you have to think about
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
where you're going to accept the house
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
version I'm just saying that chairman
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
Weiler I mean you might not want to
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
follow that
 
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.190 align:start position:0%
follow that
um

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.630 align:start position:0%
um
or

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
itl the bill and just keep things the
 
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
way they are and have a more
 
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
well as a former chair of Finance knows
 
00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
that those of us that are still here on
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
finance are kind of unruly Bunch
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
including chairman Weiler so we'll try
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
to do what's best thank you very much
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
but when I was chaired the group was not
 
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
unruly and you of all people should know
 
00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:09.299 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
no I do recall you coming to the door
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
many times Madam chair so uh
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative evil has a question
 
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
aren't uh
 
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:27.419 align:start position:0%
vacuum and Senator Abbas was the Prime
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor for this
 
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
um do you know from testimony that you
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
received in the Judiciary Committee
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
whether the change in um
 
00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:42.419 align:start position:0%
payment responsibilities was motivated
 
00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:45.299 align:start position:0%
in this bill from the policy side or
 
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
precisely because I do know the answer
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
to that because I have been told the
 
00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:53.900 align:start position:0%
answer and that is that the court
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
asked for the change they'd rather it
 
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
was and made it more clear to them if it
 
00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
went through the judicial Council
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
so because that makes perfect sense to
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
me but the the portion of it where the
 
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
requirement for the folks that are
 
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed to be basically
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
waived what was the was that also from
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
the quarter what was the Genesis of that
 
00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:28.700 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the bill
 
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
was drafted according to what the court
 
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
wanted but we all know many is the slip
 
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
00:29:42.659 --> 00:29:44.210 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
so

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
representative you presented two options
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
is there a third we have a lot of
 
00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:50.899 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
that we need to know where the money's
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
coming from can we retain the bill we
 
00:29:59.930 --> 00:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
get the answers those questions
 
00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
um retain is is certainly
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
00:30:15.529 --> 00:30:15.539 align:start position:0%
Smith I do like the idea representative
 
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative Smith
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
someone from the judicial Council would
 
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
you like to
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
speak and if you state your name for the
 
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Richard Sam
 
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
Peril I'm the acting executive director
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire judicial Council
 
00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.250 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire judicial Council
um

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
so I've learned a little bit about the
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
process throughout the course of the
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
prior hearings and about the payment
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
process but
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
um I'll tell you sort of from the
 
00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
judicial council's perspective what the
 
00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559 align:start position:0%
concerns are here
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
one is if this responsibility is
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
transferred to the judicial Council
 
00:31:12.889 --> 00:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
there's currently nothing in our budget
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
or our proposed budget in terms of
 
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
payment for this particular line of
 
00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:18.850 align:start position:0%
payment for this particular line of
services

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:18.860 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
so we would be in the position of having
 
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
to go back to fiscal and ask for an
 
00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:27.299 align:start position:0%
additional appropriation to make these
 
00:31:27.299 --> 00:31:28.310 align:start position:0%
additional appropriation to make these
payments

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
then we get to the issue of how much to
 
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
ask for and
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
um I think that amount is a bit murky
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
because the fiscal note includes
 
00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
information from Health and Human
 
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
Services that has an estimate for what
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
they have paid which is nine hundred
 
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars uh annually and then
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch keeps data on their
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
website as to the number of involuntary
 
00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
admissions that take place in a given
 
00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:03.419 align:start position:0%
year that's the data I used in my
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
interpretation of what the cost would be
 
00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:10.460 align:start position:0%
I should say that that applies to both
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
involuntary emergency Admissions and to
 
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
non-emergency admissions so all forms of
 
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh commitment whether they're emergency
 
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:22.940 align:start position:0%
or not but it would be an additional
 
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
basically 2500 invoices that we would be
 
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
paying a year I I don't think that's a
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
huge amount but it is sort of for our
 
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
agency because of how small we are it's
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
me and then it's two staff members that
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
process all of the the bills so uh the
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
volume of those additional
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is a concern in
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
addition to that we've only been talking
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
about paying for the lawyers but the
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
legislation would also transfer the
 
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
responsibility for services in addition
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
to lawyers again I don't know
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
practically speaking how often that
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
comes up but it would impose an
 
00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
obligation to pay for expert Witnesses
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
or anything else like that
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
um and then in terms of the actual cost
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
um so my understanding is that the
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
judicial branch has a contract with
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
certain lawyers to provide these Legal
 
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
Services it pays them a flat rate that's
 
00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:24.299 align:start position:0%
the minimum amount that's in the fiscal
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
node but the court also has a rule that
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
establishes a maximum potential payment
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
in these cases that's the maximum amount
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
that that's how uh I got to the amount
 
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:40.140 align:start position:0%
that's listed there as uh almost 1.5
 
00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.330 align:start position:0%
that's listed there as uh almost 1.5
million

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
so that would be the monetary amount we
 
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
would be talking about there I do have
 
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
one other additional concern I want to
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
address with you which is the collection
 
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
part of it and there
 
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
um I I will admit I'm confused about
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
what the process would be the mechanics
 
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
of collection these hearings are
 
00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:06.899 align:start position:0%
typically sort of one and done with the
 
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
court and the concern I would have is
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
that because this is a population that
 
00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:18.020 align:start position:0%
perhaps doesn't always have a reliable
 
00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
housing address information maybe is a
 
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
little less reliable in showing up for
 
00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:25.859 align:start position:0%
court appearances or making contact with
 
00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
office of Cost Containment that we're
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
turning a
 
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
half hour hearing on a one given date
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
into a multi-hearing event and now we're
 
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
paying for lawyers on successifications
 
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
again I don't know practically speaking
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
how that works now but I do have that
 
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
concern when I hear the conversation
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
about OCC and collection uh for the
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
legal services from this particular type
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
of population
 
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
those are my thoughts on this I'm happy
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
seeing that you wish to take questions
 
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099 align:start position:0%
representative Carol McGuire
 
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
actually it's it's more to you Mr chair
 
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh did rejected that amendment to
 
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
require repayment and Cost Containment
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore we should not be
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
considering it
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
because the house position is that and
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
the Senate position is that the the
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
state or some other source of funds will
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
pay for these lawyers and Recovery is
 
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
not on the table as far as I'm concerned
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
no we're just looking at the bills that
 
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
came to us from the Senate and as it was
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
approved by the house without the
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
amendment right and
 
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.210 align:start position:0%
amendment right and
[Music]

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:44.220 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
from the physical
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
all funds involved are General funds
 
00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
thanks for pointing it out I can I
 
00:36:01.609 --> 00:36:01.619 align:start position:0%
address what little information I have
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
about the source of funding
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
um my belief is that there this is
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
generally paid out of General funds uh
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
out of state funds I do think the
 
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
judicial branch in terms of what they've
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
been paying that they may have received
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
a small amount of arpa money and so if
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
this responsibility was transferred we
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
would ask them to transfer that but I
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
don't think that is a long-term payment
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think the federal government
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
is a long-term payment source for this
 
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no further questions
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
I'll representative Dan McGuire thank
 
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
you do you know much about the mechanics
 
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
of how these cases are processed we've
 
00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
heard that there's about a half dozen a
 
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
day is that you know one judge and one
 
00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:51.740 align:start position:0%
attorney traveled to the state hospital
 
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
and setups you know six in a row for an
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
hour or two and and just do it or is it
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
six different attorneys and all that do
 
00:37:02.569 --> 00:37:02.579 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
the answer is I don't but I do know a
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
little and in my belief is that uh on a
 
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
given day a lot of these hearings are
 
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
not all in person Summer by video that a
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
lawyer who contracts with the judicial
 
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.530 align:start position:0%
lawyer who contracts with the judicial
branches

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
branches
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
representing people on a given day but
 
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
that they have a designated judge going
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
through and doing these hearings but
 
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
again I say that with the caveat that I
 
00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
I don't have any personal experience
 
00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
with these times kinds of hearings and I
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
don't have a good understanding of the
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.619 --> 00:37:52.609 align:start position:0%
 
quickly

00:37:52.609 --> 00:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
if you could take the mic please
 
00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:04.250 align:start position:0%
if you could take the mic please
thanks

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
there's a very strict time limit
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
um in terms of how long you can wait
 
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
until you have this trial
 
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
um I mean this procedure it's really not
 
00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
a trial
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
um and it's the first thing that a judge
 
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
has to do when he comes in on a Monday
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
morning or she comes in on a Monday
 
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
morning and it is
 
00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:28.700 align:start position:0%
almost never done in person
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
and the attorney gets we haven't
 
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
mentioned this yet the attorney gets a
 
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.810 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
and

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.470 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
the case is made and the judge rules and
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
was that short enough it was thank you
 
00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.270 align:start position:0%
was that short enough it was thank you
certainly

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%

00:41:59.569 --> 00:41:59.579 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak briefly since it
 
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
I guess it really affects you more than
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else so the um so the couple
 
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
things it's uh trauma kits not first aid
 
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339 align:start position:0%
kits we had a couple of discussions with
 
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
Senator Apprentice about this
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
um over time and uh I know her vision is
 
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
lots of kits and lots of buildings
 
00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:20.099 align:start position:0%
and we had discussions about you know
 
00:42:22.089 --> 00:42:22.099 align:start position:0%
which buildings count as buildings and
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
buildings is one of those questions if
 
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
you ask the question how many buildings
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
does the state have
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
um the answer is depends what you mean
 
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
and um you know is it 91 is it 216 or is
 
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
it a thousand and four and
 
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
um you know the energy database has one
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
number and all of that I think based on
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
what she wanted to do we came to the
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
conclusion that for the first tranche of
 
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
what she wants to do there are about 200
 
00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.510 align:start position:0%
what she wants to do there are about 200
buildings

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
I don't do you remember the derivation
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
so we decided to exclude hospitals and
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
institutions under the assumption that
 
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
they would already have similar type
 
00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:05.099 align:start position:0%
equipment on hand also things like salt
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
sheds anything where there's people that
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
aren't in those buildings and that's
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
where we came up to the uh came up with
 
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
the two to three hundred range of
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
buildings where we we would be
 
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
just for a little history I got ahead of
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
myself just so the committee knows this
 
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
did pass Edna unanimously 16-0 and there
 
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
was a Voice vote and it passed on the
 
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
house floor in a Voice vote
 
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
so representative Dan McGuire you had a
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
question yes did you include liquor
 
00:43:36.839 --> 00:43:38.690 align:start position:0%
question yes did you include liquor
stores

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
stores
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
I believe we did include liquor stores
 
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:44.210 align:start position:0%
I believe we did include liquor stores
yes

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative grass I know you
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned you took out salt sheds and
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
other places where people are present
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
but having worked in the field
 
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
um that's some place where people tend
 
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
to be injured
 
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
uh because they're in and out of
 
00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
vehicles and they're they're working
 
00:43:58.609 --> 00:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
with heavy equipment in those locations
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any idea of how many
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
additional locations those would it
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
would include
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
as Charlie mentioned earlier
 
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:08.579 align:start position:0%
um somewhere around a thousand buildings
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
is the number of buildings we track in
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
our energy database for buildings that
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
use energy so that could be anything
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
from a small restroom building at a
 
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
state park to a salt shed to a hospital
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
or a correctional facility so somewhere
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
in that range where we said you know two
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
to three hundred up to a thousand would
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
be you know depending on how far you
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
want to go I could get you some more
 
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
detailed breakdown of what types of
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
facilities those are if if that would be
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
something of Interest
 
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
I think Senator princess came up with
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
the with the number like the 220 in in
 
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
figure out a reasonable range for first
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
implementation that included
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
you know not every storage building but
 
00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:53.099 align:start position:0%
every building which you know got us the
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
sort of the biggest bang for the this
 
00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
would be the best 200 or so to do and it
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that you know that that you
 
00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
know every building at the park and in a
 
00:45:05.089 --> 00:45:05.099 align:start position:0%
park is not suitable or people at parks
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
all the time but how about these and not
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
these and I think there's a provision in
 
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
the bill something about having the
 
00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
department or the fire safety fire
 
00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
standards or someone like that decide
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
which buildings on the assumption that
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
they're the
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
they're better at trauma than the rest
 
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
of us
 
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
I would just be concerned about
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
particularly in public works I know that
 
00:45:25.609 --> 00:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
salt sheds a lot of times not moving
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
equipment around as much but it
 
00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:29.099 align:start position:0%
certainly is something Whenever there is
 
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
heavy equipment involved there's always
 
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
the chance for an injury and uh so
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's something that we should be
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative
 
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.390 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative
Weiler

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
Weiler
 
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
another concern of course would be a
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
storage building or a salt shed if it's
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
if it's unoccupied
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
and there's nobody there with the
 
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
training or even could tell them where
 
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
it was it's not much use and it's likely
 
00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:56.780 align:start position:0%
to be either taken or or you know
 
00:45:59.329 --> 00:45:59.339 align:start position:0%
misused if it's just left in an
 
00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
unoccupied empty building so I think you
 
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
have to have people available people in
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
the building some idea where it is and
 
00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
not leaving it just kind of where
 
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
anybody can grab it I think we would try
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
to follow the kind of standards that you
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of buildings now have
 
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
and have an AED a AED AED
 
00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
um and uh follow those kind of Standards
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
where you want you want them to be uh
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
somewhat secure and not just you know
 
00:46:29.329 --> 00:46:29.339 align:start position:0%
readily available but also somewhat
 
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
secure and that's
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
a balancing act that I'm pretty sure we
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
could probably accomplish
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
representative Dia Maguire fire followed
 
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
by representative Griffin thank you Mr
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:42.890 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
um let's talk about the money aspects of
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
this so this bill doesn't actually
 
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:49.859 align:start position:0%
allocate any money to purchase this it
 
00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
sets up a dedicated fund but doesn't put
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
any money into it now in general does
 
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
your department keep separate dedicated
 
00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:01.740 align:start position:0%
funds for different aspects of you know
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
do you have the the desk fund and the
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
chair fund and the you know the first
 
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
aid kit fund like that or or do you just
 
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
sort of buy these things in bulk well so
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
from an accounting standpoint we you
 
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
know dedicated funds are a thing in the
 
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
budget and if you've had The Misfortune
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
to be on that committee at any point
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
um that's you know that's the thing and
 
00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
and that whole process and the book
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's published every year in addition
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
to that though we routinely allocate
 
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
everything we spend you know you can't
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
spend a dime without it coming out of a
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
specific accounting unit a specific
 
00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
class line and if we were to receive
 
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
gifts for trauma kits it's not
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
problematic without there being a
 
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund for us to make sure that
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
the money is spent on trauma kits and to
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
track that because it would be done
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
through just class lines and activity
 
00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
codes so that's not really it's not
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
really an issue but you could do it
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
without being a dedicated dedicated fund
 
00:47:59.770 --> 00:47:59.780 align:start position:0%
it could just be
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
earmarked so to speak at the department
 
00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
for this purpose and we would use it for
 
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
that purpose it's something that we
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
typically typically do
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
although we don't often receive
 
00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.770 align:start position:0%
although we don't often receive
donations

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
donations
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
it's not we're not a 1c3 yeah
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.270 align:start position:0%
thank you so
um

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
all right so that explains and and is I
 
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
communicated with Senator Prentiss and
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
she told me she thought the reason she
 
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
put in the dedicated fund was she
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
thought that was necessary for gifts and
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
grants which it isn't so all right the
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
second thing is the having some money to
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
get this going right
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
um do you think that roughly fifty
 
00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars would be suitable for
 
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
I I would think so the you know my
 
00:48:50.569 --> 00:48:50.579 align:start position:0%
understanding from the good Senator is
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
that trauma kits are relatively you know
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
they're a lot more complicated than than
 
00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
a first aid kit which is you know 20 40
 
00:48:59.690 --> 00:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
50 bucks but they're not so much more
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
complicated that a decent trauma kid of
 
00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
the kind she foresees is dramatically
 
00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
expensive and we certainly could and
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
like anything else that we do we spend
 
00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
money within funds appropriated and we
 
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
every day every decision Karen makes
 
00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
every day involves triage
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
and so that's what we would be doing
 
00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin followed by
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative Carol McGuire
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
when I when I first saw this ballet
 
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
said to myself wow that's a great idea
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
what I immediately said
 
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
why why do we have to pass a state law
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
why can't we do it administratively and
 
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
then I read the section about limited
 
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
liability for anyone using the trauma
 
00:49:52.849 --> 00:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
kit but I think probably a good
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
Samaritan laws cover that anyway
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then I thought about well what
 
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
happens if there's a case in the LLB and
 
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
someone goes for the trauma kit and it's
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
not there
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
then we have a we have a real liability
 
00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.089 align:start position:0%
then we have a we have a real liability
so

00:50:14.089 --> 00:50:14.099 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
I'm not really in favor of making this a
 
00:50:19.849 --> 00:50:19.859 align:start position:0%
state law I am in favor
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
of drama kits in in the most of the
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
buildings the Occupy buildings of a
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
state but I don't see why it can't be
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
done administratively
 
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
or money put in the budget for it so it
 
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
can be done administratively without
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
passing a separate law
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have an opinion on that
 
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
represent Carol McGuire yeah yes thank
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair from what I remember from
 
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
dealing with this in Edna
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
the total amount of money we figured for
 
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
the first group was something less than
 
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
because there's a truck 200 buildings a
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
couple of hundred dollars for trauma kit
 
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
you know you're talking five ten
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
it's not a big deal and I and I agree I
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
think that the cost of maintaining the
 
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund would
 
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
be wasted for the amount of gifts and
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
grants you'd be getting for this
 
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative Griffin
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
that this would be better to uh
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
advise the building managers that you
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
know you've got a lot of people coming
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
through you might want to have a have a
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
a trauma kit as well as your AED and
 
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
your first aid kit
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
because we thought we were thinking of
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
accidents like in public works or in the
 
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
liquor store but on further research
 
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
these are mostly for gunshot wounds
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
we haven't had a gunshot case in the LLB
 
00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
that I know of
 
00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:01.220 align:start position:0%
for a few years at least
 
00:52:03.849 --> 00:52:03.859 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
I think just being ready for it is uh
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
like representative Griffin said we can
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:19.740 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner what's been said seems
 
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
to make a lot of sense because if you go
 
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
to somewhere you have an eye wash for
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
instance I don't think someone had to
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
come to the legislature to say you know
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
we really should have an eye wash here
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
in this particular room because their
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
handling hazardous materials is that a
 
00:52:37.849 --> 00:52:37.859 align:start position:0%
good subjects and rules usually yeah I
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
think that's perfectly fair I don't I
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
don't have a dog in this fight so to
 
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
speak do you give us money for trauma
 
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
kids will spend it on trauma kits if you
 
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
don't give us money for trauma kids we
 
00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
representative evil followed by
 
00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin thank you so I
 
00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
also talked to Senator Prentice and I
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
got her testimony that she submitted and
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
it says here that the kits run from 23
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
to 83 dollars a piece and although their
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
service can be Priceless the thing that
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
really struck me is she said in the
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire bleed outs are
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
the third highest
 
00:53:22.559 --> 00:53:23.390 align:start position:0%
the third highest
um

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
third highest cause of death and in the
 
00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
U.S it's like fourth it's preventative
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
death and I guess my
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
my concern would be yes we can tell you
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
that you should have them but unless
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
there's something that requires you to
 
00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
have them and there's not specific
 
00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
funding you might not and this seemed
 
00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
like such a simple logical thing to me I
 
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
came to the different conclusion I
 
00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:53.579 align:start position:0%
thought that it was a good idea and also
 
00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
we're at the very end of the road here
 
00:54:00.049 --> 00:54:00.059 align:start position:0%
and from a policy perspective the the
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
house did pass it and it was recommended
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.049 --> 00:54:09.059 align:start position:0%
okay it was just informed that
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative Dan McGuire has an
 
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
amendment that may fix some of these
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
had a chance to take a quick look and
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
ask representative Deanne McGuire to
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
speak to his Amendment please
 
00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so
 
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
um this is a replace all so it should be
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
relatively easy to read
 
00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:56.510 align:start position:0%
relatively easy to read
um

00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
it does three things compared to the
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.250 align:start position:0%
original bill
so

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
um number one it at it it removes the
 
00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:05.579 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund
 
00:55:08.329 --> 00:55:08.339 align:start position:0%
then it allocates fifty thousand dollars
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
for this purpose now if it turns out 50
 
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
is too much and it should be 20
 
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
I assume the Das doesn't have to spend
 
00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:18.500 align:start position:0%
every last dollar
 
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
allocated right they might have a lapse
 
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
that they might appreciate anyway so
 
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.230 align:start position:0%
that they might appreciate anyway so
um

00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
but and there might be some installation
 
00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
type costs right you might have to put a
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
hook on the wall and a sign and who
 
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
knows what or a box or signs in the
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
elevators yeah
 
00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
so there might be other costs besides
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
the The Bare Bones cost of the kit
 
00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
itself enter and also distribution and
 
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
the other thing it did was the original
 
00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
bill created a um Committee of EMTs and
 
00:55:53.089 --> 00:55:53.099 align:start position:0%
told them to come up with a list of
 
00:55:56.329 --> 00:55:56.339 align:start position:0%
places and so on and so that seemed like
 
00:55:59.089 --> 00:55:59.099 align:start position:0%
Overkill to me so I
 
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
um replaced the committee with saying
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
Das should perform this and they should
 
00:56:08.089 --> 00:56:08.099 align:start position:0%
consult with the EMTs
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
um just in terms of what kit to buy and
 
00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
and things like that so so it made it a
 
00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
little less less
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
complicated I think
 
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Dan McGuire
 
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
um I like
 
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
I like your uh Amendment but I'm still
 
00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
a trauma kit shall be installed and
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
readily available in in state-owned
 
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.690 align:start position:0%
readily available in in state-owned
buildings

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
as a general thing with it needs to be
 
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
really narrowed down to
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:51.020 align:start position:0%
designated by somebody or whatever
 
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
state-owned buildings we've heard this
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't spawn how you want to count them
 
00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
when there's a hundred uh
 
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
a thousand
 
00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
and and that opens up to liability when
 
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
someone gets there it and there's no
 
00:57:07.609 --> 00:57:07.619 align:start position:0%
trauma get in the building
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's great to raise the
 
00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:12.109 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's great to raise the
money

00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
you know I still think probably we
 
00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
should retain this thing and work on it
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
and raise the money so Charlie has the
 
00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
money to
 
00:57:25.849 --> 00:57:25.859 align:start position:0%
put them out where it makes sense
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
you know the buildings are occupied or
 
00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:29.870 align:start position:0%
you know the buildings are occupied or
remember

00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
yeah so that line is unchanged from the
 
00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
original bill it does not say all
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
state-owned buildings right so
 
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh representative evil fall by represent
 
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:52.309 align:start position:0%
uh representative evil fall by represent
grassy

00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
five the most needy buildings that that
 
00:57:58.030 --> 00:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
concern of all state buildings has been
 
00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:03.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I said two things I I might
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
add or least because if we want the
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
liquor stores they're all leased and I
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
believe the chief here can answer some
 
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
more technical questions if you have
 
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
them about
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
emsc sort of things
 
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
or if you could take a seat please and
 
00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:23.099 align:start position:0%
state your name for the record surely um
 
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
Justin mom chief of the Bureau of Ems
 
00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
for the state I work for the division of
 
00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:29.579 align:start position:0%
fire standards and training I believe
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
the original mindset was kind of like a
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
crawl walk run so the reason why it was
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
state owned and occupied buildings was
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
that these are Public Access kits
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
although they they certainly could
 
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
benefit in some of the
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
um you know the public work areas but it
 
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
was for Public Access
 
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:50.220 align:start position:0%
as Senator Prentice mentioned in her
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
testimony you know bleeding out is a um
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
is something that could be corrected
 
00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
pretty easily with these kits um with
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
quick action
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
um and so the mindset is to get more of
 
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
these kits out there starting small with
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh state-owned buildings and state
 
00:59:08.809 --> 00:59:08.819 align:start position:0%
occupied buildings
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
um training uh is minimal our e901 so
 
00:59:15.049 --> 00:59:15.059 align:start position:0%
our Dispatch Center anytime somebody
 
00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
calls 9-1-1 they get one Center in the
 
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire those individuals
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
that are taking that call can direct
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
somebody on how to put a tourniquet on
 
00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:26.339 align:start position:0%
through the phone uh it's very easy and
 
00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:28.140 align:start position:0%
I believe the original Amendment the
 
00:59:29.809 --> 00:59:29.819 align:start position:0%
reason why or the original bill is the
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
reason why they had some of the language
 
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
in there for protection was for just
 
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
that liability is that if somebody were
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
to use these similar to how nalox
 
00:59:41.049 --> 00:59:41.059 align:start position:0%
cylinders separate
 
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
liability protections and that sort of
 
00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:44.450 align:start position:0%
liability protections and that sort of
thing

00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
um as far as cost you know there's a
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
range based on what where what Senate
 
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
Apprentice was requiring in the kit
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
there's different
 
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
um options to fulfill the different
 
00:59:56.089 --> 00:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
requirements and that's why there's a
 
00:59:56.099 --> 00:59:57.349 align:start position:0%
requirements and that's why there's a
range

00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
range
 
01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:00.500 align:start position:0%
um and the mindset to add
 
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
members of the division my division I'm
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
sorry my Bureau as well as one of our
 
01:00:09.049 --> 01:00:09.059 align:start position:0%
boards that our advisory boards was to
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
have the same folks that are overseeing
 
01:00:15.049 --> 01:00:15.059 align:start position:0%
the EMS in the state the entire EMS
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
system also to have guidance on on this
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
with the sole regulatory of EMS in this
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
state we advise our providers on what
 
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
equipment they should have what they
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have and so I believe the
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
senator thought that that was made sense
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative Weiler thank
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman when I first read the
 
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
bill I was picturing these kits with the
 
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
batteries in them that shocked the heart
 
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
when it stops and I guess they were
 
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
quite a bit more expensive and I guess
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
that's not the intent of the bill so
 
01:00:53.289 --> 01:00:53.299 align:start position:0%
so we do have a Statewide
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
bid for aeds in the state and so what
 
01:00:58.730 --> 01:00:58.740 align:start position:0%
that means is any business has the
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
ability to purchase an AED at a reduced
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
price and that'll also the Only Rule
 
01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:06.059 align:start position:0%
requirement is that it's registered
 
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
within the state the benefit of that is
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
that when somebody calls 9-1-1 the 911
 
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
operator is able to direct somebody to
 
01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
the closest AED
 
01:01:17.809 --> 01:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
there is a mechanism that that this
 
01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
could be done for bleeding kids down the
 
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
road that isn't part of this but that's
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
ultimately nationally that's the mindset
 
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
the two things we could prevent is
 
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
bleeding out and quick access to
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
electricity AED is going to correct the
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
abnormal Rhythm and again it's easy
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
things that anybody can do to to Really
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative evil thank you
 
01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
my first question is really boring could
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
you give me your name please certainly
 
01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
okay and then the second one could you
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
um just clarify the product the
 
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
professional credentials of Senator
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
Prentice because she clearly knows where
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
of she speaks surely um so she she had
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
my position a few years back um so she
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
was a former Chief of the Bureau of EMS
 
01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
she is I believe she's now the director
 
01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
of the American trauma uh
 
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.049 align:start position:0%
of the American trauma uh
Services

01:02:26.049 --> 01:02:26.059 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
a trauma society and she is also a
 
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
paramedic and still an active paramedic
 
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
which is the highest level pre-hospital
 
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.930 align:start position:0%
which is the highest level pre-hospital
providering

01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
providering
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
search here just all I would just add is
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
that I did speak to her and I know
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire did too and she
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
was very passionate about this and she
 
01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
said that this was a really simple way
 
01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
of saving many lives and she was really
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
hopeful that the bill could go forward
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
and she's not here by the way because of
 
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
her job she had to travel to Washington
 
01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:00.650 align:start position:0%
her job she had to travel to Washington
D.C

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
see no further questions for you you're
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:08.339 align:start position:0%
okay we do have an amendment before us I
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
agree with several that have spoken that
 
01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
makes a number of good improvements
 
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative dear Maguire well the one
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
thing we've heard in this testimony is
 
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
that maybe after state-owned we should
 
01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
add and state occupied
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
so that that way at least buildings that
 
01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:34.190 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:39.250 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
because it may be the owner of the
 
01:03:43.849 --> 01:03:43.859 align:start position:0%
building that's responsible for
 
01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
providing certain things versus it being
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
a mandate from the state because the
 
01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
state doesn't own their particular
 
01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:58.789 align:start position:0%
state doesn't own their particular
buildings

01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't hurt right a trauma kit
 
01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
shall be installed and ready readily
 
01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
available in selected state-owned and
 
01:04:09.289 --> 01:04:09.299 align:start position:0%
state-occupied buildings
 
01:04:09.299 --> 01:04:11.150 align:start position:0%
state-occupied buildings
representable

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
representable
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:18.119 --> 01:04:19.630 align:start position:0%
 
Pacific

01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
Pacific
 
01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
speaking as a lawyer
 
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you I I
 
01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:26.579 align:start position:0%
think I understand where the issue comes
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
because the way I would read a trauma
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
kit shall be installed and readily
 
01:04:33.049 --> 01:04:33.059 align:start position:0%
available in state-owned buildings that
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
sentence right there feels like the
 
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
requirement is for every state-owned
 
01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:39.299 align:start position:0%
building so I do think so adding in the
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
either pursuant to or just the language
 
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
of in selected state-owned and or
 
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
occupied buildings clears it up that
 
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
it's not every
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
well I think you could say identified
 
01:04:54.289 --> 01:04:54.299 align:start position:0%
pursuant to section blah blah blah or
 
01:04:54.299 --> 01:04:55.190 align:start position:0%
pursuant to section blah blah blah or
something

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
it just makes it really clear
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
come on Dan
 
01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:03.299 align:start position:0%
I think in general when when you have
 
01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:06.299 align:start position:0%
sorry when you have a whole section you
 
01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
don't have to say in section one see
 
01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
section three right it's all part of the
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
part yeah all right so
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
um hopefully we can get that if the
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
division supports well let's have a
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
little show of hands with the corrected
 
01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
language and the representative Deanne
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
McGuire we all okay with that
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
Dan if you could get that ready for us
 
01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
well there's a 50 000 do you want to
 
01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.349 align:start position:0%
well there's a 50 000 do you want to
speak

01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
okay I I'm okay with that but
 
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh representative Sweeney do you have
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
just one question with these and this
 
01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
sort of with the Senate bills that we do
 
01:05:55.859 --> 01:05:56.930 align:start position:0%
sort of with the Senate bills that we do
have

01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
they put it in their version of the
 
01:05:58.799 --> 01:05:59.690 align:start position:0%
they put it in their version of the
budget

01:05:59.690 --> 01:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
or is this
 
01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman
 
01:06:10.569 --> 01:06:10.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
I believe that
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative Griffin had a
 
01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.329 align:start position:0%
okay representative Griffin had a
question

01:06:17.329 --> 01:06:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
oh yes yeah so
 
01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.710 align:start position:0%
oh yes yeah so
um

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
so I figured 250 buildings times two
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars that's that's fifty
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
thousand right so you know the there's
 
01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
the kit but there may be some ancillary
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
costs so that's kind of where it came
 
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
from can I just ask if they have to
 
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
re-replace if they're used I mean how
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
does that work like is there an
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
expiration date like are they only good
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
for a couple of years no matter whether
 
01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
they're used or not do they have to be
 
01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
replaced like fall kits I know that you
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
have to be replacing like five years
 
01:06:54.480 --> 01:07:43.370 align:start position:0%
have to be replacing like five years
foreign

01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
all right so uh we did ever show a hands
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
on the McGuire Amendment which passed
 
01:07:51.289 --> 01:07:51.299 align:start position:0%
unanimously now we'll vote on the bill
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
as amended when the clerk is ready to
 
01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:54.740 align:start position:0%
call though I'll do a much better
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
amendment number
 
01:07:58.809 --> 01:07:58.819 align:start position:0%
um it's currently
 
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
2064 H but obviously that's going to
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.559 --> 01:08:06.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
um so we're voting on SB 204
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
otpa and representative McGuire yes
 
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin representative
 
01:08:18.729 --> 01:08:18.739 align:start position:0%
Sweeney yes representative Carol McGuire
 
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
representative grassy yes
 
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
clerk votes yes chair Weiler yes
 
01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:26.689 align:start position:0%
clerk votes yes chair Weiler yes
okay

01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
eight zero and chair I said
 
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
representative Wyler he said yes I
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
didn't oh and chair Leachman well that's
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
fine yes okay but I was so excited I had
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
eight nothing yeah
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna get fired okay so thank you
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
so we have one more we'll try to get
 
01:08:58.130 --> 01:08:58.140 align:start position:0%
through this quickly as well Senate bill
 
01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:00.470 align:start position:0%
through this quickly as well Senate bill
267.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
267.
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
requiring the commissioner of the
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services to
 
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
consider cumulative impacts analysis and
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
rules and statutes
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
um yes the good senator from District 24
 
01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.930 align:start position:0%
um yes the good senator from District 24
right

01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
um I have come to
 
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
clarify any questions you may have about
 
01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
um it's Genesis and how it ended up
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
where it is
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
the change that you see between the
 
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill the amended Senate bill and
 
01:09:43.849 --> 01:09:43.859 align:start position:0%
the house bill is a deepening of the
 
01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:45.590 align:start position:0%
the house bill is a deepening of the
reporting

01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
um the Senate bill
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
if you go to your amendment by the house
 
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
the addition
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
of the house environment and
 
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
agricultural committee has been added
 
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
um and uh our deepest apologies for not
 
01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
including in the Senate Bill we had
 
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
originally only reported out to house
 
01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
resources Recreation and development
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
and natural resources committee so this
 
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
is a third committee that should that
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
should absolutely receive this report on
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
findings of cumulative impacts I'd just
 
01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
like to point out to the division this
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
did pass out of the environment and
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee 19-0 yes and on
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
um so the appropriation I think is a
 
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty thousand I believe
 
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
unless that was also amended I don't
 
01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
210 on the newest oh do I have the wrong
 
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
there it is yes Senator I think I think
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
23 oh yes you did
 
01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:07.430 align:start position:0%
23 oh yes you did
okay

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
questions for the good Senator
 
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
Senator can you um tell us what
 
01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
uh time impact this is likely to have on
 
01:11:20.699 --> 01:11:21.950 align:start position:0%
uh time impact this is likely to have on
people

01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
um well it actually
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
isn't it doesn't impact them at all
 
01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:35.870 align:start position:0%
right now
um

01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
what you may have heard in the for if
 
01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and there was a time impact that has
 
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
been stripped out and now we have uh per
 
01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
our conversations with the Department of
 
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
uh energy
 
01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:57.890 align:start position:0%
uh energy
and

01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
um invite I'm sorry with the Department
 
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services is that they
 
01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
um would like to put
 
01:12:06.649 --> 01:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
some serious effort into doing this
 
01:12:09.649 --> 01:12:09.659 align:start position:0%
which is why you see I see the thank you
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
for the the redone
 
01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:15.140 align:start position:0%
um the 123 000
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
expenditure is for Staffing so that this
 
01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:24.380 align:start position:0%
person might be able to put an actual
 
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
formula together if you will and we have
 
01:12:30.169 --> 01:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
input from our neighboring states who
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
have already begun to do this kind of
 
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
work so we are not Reinventing the wheel
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
we are putting we are using a template
 
01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
that has been used successfully in other
 
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
places but the impact of this data which
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
we do collect but only for individual
 
01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
sites so the change that this will make
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
is that when someone goes to permit
 
01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
what we are looking to assess is right
 
01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
now permitting exists in The Silo of the
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
space of the permit and the type of
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
permit being asked for it does not take
 
01:13:11.649 --> 01:13:11.659 align:start position:0%
into account
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
what may also be within the neighborhood
 
01:13:17.209 --> 01:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
so if you're looking at a an industrial
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
park it matters what the neighbor's
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
doing right because you what you do
 
01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
could have impact on the neighbor and
 
01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
vice versa so assessing what those
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts could be
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
is what the nature of this bill is about
 
01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
is to assess what they are how are we
 
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
going to measure them how are we going
 
01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
to report them out and how will we
 
01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.810 align:start position:0%
to report them out and how will we
potentially

01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:40.820 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
Implement that into future rules or
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
legislation nothing that impacts what's
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
happening right now and as of right now
 
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
we don't have any outstanding
 
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.649 align:start position:0%
we don't have any outstanding
applications

01:13:54.649 --> 01:13:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
so there's it wouldn't be affecting
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
anyone who has something in the works
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
right now because there isn't anything
 
01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative Thank You by Carol
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you man Mr chairman thank
 
01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
you senator for coming
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
um what does the word facilities mean in
 
01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
this context is this energy generation
 
01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
tell me exactly where you are
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
um oh proposal for example proposed
 
01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.689 align:start position:0%
um oh proposal for example proposed
facility

01:14:26.689 --> 01:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
right um so proposed facilities
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
um any any proposed facility that would
 
01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
have to seek out in their current
 
01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:36.229 align:start position:0%
have to seek out in their current
permitting

01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
um would have to have an assessment of
 
01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:40.130 align:start position:0%
um would have to have an assessment of
potential

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:40.140 align:start position:0%
potential
 
01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
um air pollution potential groundwater
 
01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
pollution like what we do now for
 
01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
individual sites that we do we do this
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
now so we we assess what happens within
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
one particular site what we don't take
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
into account is how that site affects
 
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
the site next to it Downstream from it
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
up upwind from it this
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
would start to look at the accumulation
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
hence cumulative impacts yeah so uh
 
01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
is a facility could be an apartment
 
01:15:20.209 --> 01:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
building no no we're talking about
 
01:15:20.219 --> 01:15:20.990 align:start position:0%
building no no we're talking about
um

01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
potentially energy energy facilities
 
01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:27.500 align:start position:0%
waste facilities
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
that type of facility manufacturing
 
01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:31.669 align:start position:0%
that type of facility manufacturing
facilities

01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings okay don't generate
 
01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's in the mall
 
01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
I I couldn't answer that because as part
 
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
of the permitting would they have a
 
01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
manufacturing site would they have would
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
they be generating you know air
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
pollution I don't know thank you yeah
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative Carol McGuire and then we
 
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
um this would be great because we have
 
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
been through we've all been on a journey
 
01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
together yeah if you could
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
restate your name for yes the record uh
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
just for the record my name is Craig
 
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
Wright I serve as the Director of the
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
air Resources Division at the Department
 
01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services thank you
 
01:16:19.729 --> 01:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
Carol thank you Mr chair I'm Senator I
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
find it impossible to believe you when
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
you say there is nobody who is has
 
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
currently applied for a permit that is
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
waiting for it to be approved I mean
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
every restaurant
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
and anybody dealing with Wastewater
 
01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
needs a permit
 
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
and so as what I mean air facilities yes
 
01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
there's very few but water
 
01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:46.140 align:start position:0%
everybody has water if you want Mr chair
 
01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
I can try to address that to some degree
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
so obviously the department has a number
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
of different regulatory programs and we
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
require permits for all kinds of either
 
01:16:56.090 --> 01:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
industrial facilities wastewater
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
treatment plants
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
there could be requirements for Air
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
permits water permits waste permits yes
 
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
there is currently a queue of people
 
01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
waiting to get their permits and we're
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
going through our normal review process
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
not to contradict you but but I think I
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
I think what really what the question is
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
is what this bill does is it asks the
 
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
department to go out and investigate do
 
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
a scoping study
 
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
on ways to look at cumulative impacts
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
across air water and waste I agree with
 
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
the senator right now it would have no
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
impact on facilities currently in the
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
queue because this is a scoping study to
 
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
come up with either potential new
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
regulations or statutes we need to
 
01:17:39.169 --> 01:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
address in the future
 
01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:41.699 align:start position:0%
to address cumulative impacts
 
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative McGuire yes
 
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I it
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
I I don't know much about the water
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
rules but the the waste I don't mean I
 
01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
don't know about the air rules the waste
 
01:17:57.649 --> 01:17:57.659 align:start position:0%
of the water rules I know affect a whole
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
lot of people in the state between the
 
01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
people on Wetlands or lakes or protected
 
01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.550 align:start position:0%
people on Wetlands or lakes or protected
Rivers

01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
Rivers
 
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
or needing a thousand gallons grease
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
trap for a for an ice cream shack I mean
 
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
there are lots and lots of rules already
 
01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:15.649 align:start position:0%
there are lots and lots of rules already
and

01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:15.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
I agree this this in itself may not
 
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
cause any delays but I'm
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned that adding in the
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
fact that the
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant next to you also has a grease
 
01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.610 align:start position:0%
restaurant next to you also has a grease
trap

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
trap
 
01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
or a sewer system or you're
 
01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
or some neighbor at your lake house
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
could affect a lot of people if you
 
01:18:44.649 --> 01:18:44.659 align:start position:0%
decide to
 
01:18:48.610 --> 01:18:48.620 align:start position:0%
become much more rigorous in in
 
01:18:51.169 --> 01:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
enforcing the laws because of cumulative
 
01:18:51.179 --> 01:18:53.090 align:start position:0%
enforcing the laws because of cumulative
impact

01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler please
 
01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair having been on a
 
01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
planning board for many years I think
 
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's overly broad it
 
01:19:04.729 --> 01:19:04.739 align:start position:0%
will likely cause nothing to be
 
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
developed there'll be always be somebody
 
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
to complain about ever that planning
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
board somebody complains from a mile
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
away the effect of something it's going
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
to have on them and the the explanation
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
was kind of spurious I felt
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
um and I've had had someone else send me
 
01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
a thing this never ends everything is
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
going to be objected to and it's going
 
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
to be dragged through court and I'd hate
 
01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:30.590 align:start position:0%
to be dragged through court and I'd hate
to

01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
enable the people that come in with
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
spurious complaints to claim they're
 
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
covered by law
 
01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:37.189 align:start position:0%
covered by law
I

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
it's it's just too broad I don't think I
 
01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
don't think I could vote for this
 
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
it just leaves everything
 
01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
is affecting somebody that's that's the
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
way it comes out
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin followed by
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative grassy yeah I uh
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
I probably was one of those 77 that
 
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
voted no and I was sure and I intend to
 
01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
representative grassy and followed by
 
01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative evil having worked in the
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
field with development and as a town
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
planner for 20 years
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
um I think that you know first of all we
 
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
already have projects of regional impact
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
which we take a look at accumulative
 
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
effects from Regional impact that the
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
planning the planning commissions work
 
01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
on and I think that this is something
 
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
that's very good because you know a lot
 
01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
of times when we're looking at a project
 
01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
at a planning board level we're looking
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
at the project
 
01:20:33.169 --> 01:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
you don't look at anything outside of
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
the boundaries except when we take a
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
look at traffic impacts a lot of times
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
we'll have Regional traffic impact
 
01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
studies done to show what the impact of
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
traffic will be when we take a look at
 
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
other services outside Services
 
01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes we take a look at what
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
recreational Services may be to service
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
a residential project when you're
 
01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
looking at industrial projects and even
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
residential projects that where you may
 
01:20:57.890 --> 01:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
or may not have Municipal Sewer and
 
01:20:59.689 --> 01:20:59.699 align:start position:0%
Water Systems you're taking a look at
 
01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
the impacts on the aquifers and other
 
01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
things so you know there's certainly a
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
lot here I'm not fully understanding
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
what the impacts are here I mean how
 
01:21:11.689 --> 01:21:11.699 align:start position:0%
you're going to you know what are you
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at and how this is
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
going to affect individual projects
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
in the you know when we deal with an
 
01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
image original project are you looking
 
01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
at basically
 
01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
using this law to start looking at
 
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
ways to to
 
01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:30.169 align:start position:0%
ways to to
um

01:21:30.169 --> 01:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
so when I bring in a product a project
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
comes into my planning board and I call
 
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
you and I say what are the water impacts
 
01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
this is what we're going to have for
 
01:21:38.570 --> 01:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
septic loading on this site what are
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
going to be the water impacts on the
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
aquifer that this sets on
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
is this going to help you determine
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
what's around that project so you're
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
going to give me that information as
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
well because I don't have that
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
information when I'm looking at an
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
individual project and you know when I
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
look at runoff when I look at septic I
 
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
know you're an air guy but I understand
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
the problems with air as well having
 
01:21:58.850 --> 01:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
dealt with some of those projects but
 
01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:00.659 align:start position:0%
are you going to be is this going to
 
01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
um I just want to clarify for the
 
01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
committee that the cumulative impact
 
01:22:12.169 --> 01:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
analysis portion of this
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
um is is to take into consideration
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
there is nothing right now there's no
 
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
legislation proposed there is no
 
01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
legislation written there is nothing
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
waiting what we are looking for is for
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
Des to have staff dedicated to be able
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
to find out what cumulative impacts
 
01:22:36.890 --> 01:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
means to New Hampshire and what the
 
01:22:41.050 --> 01:22:41.060 align:start position:0%
combined impacts of proposed facilities
 
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
that may be putting out potential air
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
pollution what we're not assessing right
 
01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
now is what goes up comes down and how
 
01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
does that affect the water table we
 
01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
don't look at that right now we don't do
 
01:22:57.229 --> 01:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
that at all that is not something that
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
happens for regional planning
 
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
we only do this for site specific so we
 
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
are looking to broaden our look because
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
we know particularly on the Seacoast we
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
know that once you damage the water
 
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
table you then damage your agricultural
 
01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:16.490 align:start position:0%
table you then damage your agricultural
um

01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
industry we have Farms that have been
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
directly impacted by water pollution
 
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
that's a cumulative impact because that
 
01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
then that affects our our Industries it
 
01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
affects our businesses so what we need
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
to do is to look at cumulative impacts
 
01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
with a public health lens as well so we
 
01:23:43.630 --> 01:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
would like to afford Des the opportunity
 
01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
as passed in policy already
 
01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
the 247 thousand dollars 123 in the
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
first year 124 in the second year to
 
01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
dedicate to a person to be able to do
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
this work and I think you had some
 
01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:02.219 align:start position:0%
additions so yeah I just I would just
 
01:24:02.219 --> 01:24:03.290 align:start position:0%
additions so yeah I just I would just
add

01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
add
 
01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:04.370 align:start position:0%
add
um

01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
so cumulative impacts is a term that is
 
01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
I would say is not
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
totally clearly defined anywhere either
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
in state rule state law
 
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
or in federal rule or federal law
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
the environments in which I get
 
01:24:24.649 --> 01:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
questions about cumulative impact either
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
occur from the public concerns about
 
01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
what is the impact of
 
01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
this facility in addition to this
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
facility or this air toxic in addition
 
01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
to this air toxic
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
the other place we hear it all the time
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
is coming out of EPA in the federal
 
01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.770 align:start position:0%
is coming out of EPA in the federal
government

01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's high in their agenda they've tied
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
it largely into the Civil Rights Act of
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
1964 in a term that they call
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
environmental justice
 
01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
so EPA continues pushing states to look
 
01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
at cumulative impacts without an
 
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
existing regulatory framework
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
if you're asking me what we would do if
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
this bill were passed we couldn't do
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
this work without the position I I know
 
01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that wholeheartedly
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
the things we would do is and again and
 
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
this is up the ultimate end goal is
 
01:25:17.209 --> 01:25:17.219 align:start position:0%
within two years approximately by
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
September of 2025 is to report back to
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature on recommendations from
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
the Department things we would do is
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
survey what's being done in other states
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
and what's being done at the federal
 
01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:28.189 align:start position:0%
and what's being done at the federal
level

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
um we would probably establish some sort
 
01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
of internal work group across the air
 
01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
the division the Water Division and the
 
01:25:36.169 --> 01:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
waste Division and look at where our
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
programs intersect in ways in which we
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
could look at the impacts from each of
 
01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
our programs as they piggyback on top of
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
each other we would need to consult with
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
an in-house toxicologist which is a
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
which is already in-house existing
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
position to better understand how
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts occur when you have
 
01:25:56.689 --> 01:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
different pollutants different Pathways
 
01:25:58.970 --> 01:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
of exposure and we need to consult with
 
01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:00.780 align:start position:0%
Community groups I think to determine
 
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
what is the concern of the citizenry of
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and ultimately prepare
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations and report for the
 
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
legislative General Court
 
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you represent grassy followed by
 
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
so from what I understand from what you
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
just said as a town planner and as a
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
town planning board remember this is or
 
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
a developer in the community this is
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
going to affect me at all and then over
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
the next couple years you're looking at
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
setting up getting gaining information
 
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
yourself in within your departments and
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
within Des it's not going to have any
 
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
effect on me right now but it could in
 
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
the long term provide me more
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
information absolutely but it's not
 
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
going to slow down any of my projects
 
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
not right now I mean it's a scoping
 
01:26:38.689 --> 01:26:38.699 align:start position:0%
study right now with recommendations to
 
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
how Des would have to potentially change
 
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
it's either statutes that govern Des or
 
01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:47.219 align:start position:0%
our administrative rules which all go
 
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
through public processes so you're
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
saying it's better to be prepared than
 
01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
be caught when Des comes down and says
 
01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
you have to do this stuff and we're in
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
no we haven't done anything I would say
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
if it's the desire of the legislature
 
01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
for us to consider cumulative impacts in
 
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
our programs then we need to look at it
 
01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
and do a study that's that's really all
 
01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
I'm saying
 
01:27:08.209 --> 01:27:08.219 align:start position:0%
representative of you both followed by
 
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney
 
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
um I just want to understand the
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
background of this bill did this bill
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
not start out originally as a bill that
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
would have required regulations to be
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
written for advanced recycling which was
 
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
a bill that passed last year yes and
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
that is exactly the Genesis of this bill
 
01:27:32.350 --> 01:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
which speaks to the question that
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding in my
 
01:27:38.689 --> 01:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
original presentation is that we don't
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
have any advanced recycling facilities
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
that are looking to be permitted
 
01:27:46.129 --> 01:27:46.139 align:start position:0%
that is that's what I'm talking about
 
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
not okay restaurants so thank you but I
 
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
I think if I understood the the course
 
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
of the of this Legislation during
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
discussions at enr in the Senate
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
um with some input from Des I think it
 
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
was sort of recognized that rather than
 
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
just do a set of regulations that
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
focused in isolation on one industry it
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
really would make a lot more sense for
 
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
the public health of the people of New
 
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to look more at at when you're
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
licensing a facility and I don't really
 
01:28:28.729 --> 01:28:28.739 align:start position:0%
mean a restaurant's grease trap I'm
 
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
thinking of a landfill just comes to
 
01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
mind or something like that rather than
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
looking at these things in silos it
 
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
makes a lot more sense rather than
 
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
whether it's Solid Waste or air or water
 
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
to look at it in more Global Way and
 
01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it was Senator avard who
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
introduced the amendment that that
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
changed this I thought it was but I mean
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
the idea is that you shouldn't be
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
viewing potential sources of damage to
 
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
Public Health in isolation but more
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
globally and just to continue Mr chair
 
01:29:09.169 --> 01:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that all this is is
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
really a scoping study to see if we
 
01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
couldn't do a better job of of
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
um licensing facilities and when you're
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
doing this you would ice you would
 
01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
identify the facilities you wanted to
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
apply to there would probably be some
 
01:29:29.450 --> 01:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
public input in your process you just
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
said that you would have some sort of a
 
01:29:33.890 --> 01:29:33.900 align:start position:0%
task force you'd be working with and
 
01:29:36.050 --> 01:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
then you'd make recommendations and no
 
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
regulations and no legislation would be
 
01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:40.070 align:start position:0%
regulations and no legislation would be
passed

01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
by anybody until you made your
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations so the so the I mean
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
rather than have a legislative study
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee do this that doesn't have
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
professional background this would be
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
something that you would take on at the
 
01:29:59.209 --> 01:29:59.219 align:start position:0%
agency level the ultimate goal being the
 
01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:02.540 align:start position:0%
public health of the people of the state
 
01:30:04.850 --> 01:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
represents Sweeney thank you Mr chairman
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
I have I'll have several questions I
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
think my first question is historically
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
on environmental issues in the state
 
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
when it comes to permitting licensing do
 
01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
we hire somebody for a temporary
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
two-year scoping study to perform the
 
01:30:21.649 --> 01:30:21.659 align:start position:0%
study or do we have a legislative
 
01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
commission study the impacts and the
 
01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:25.610 align:start position:0%
commission study the impacts and the
potential

01:30:25.610 --> 01:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
potential
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
future regulations
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure how to answer that
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
question I'm I can't I don't remember
 
01:30:38.689 --> 01:30:38.699 align:start position:0%
the last time we've gone down this
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
particular path
 
01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
um I think the reason
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a new position here is
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
that if if it's decided we want to look
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
at this it was just a recognition that
 
01:30:52.850 --> 01:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
we don't have the bandwidth right now in
 
01:30:55.010 --> 01:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
the department to do this work
 
01:30:56.810 --> 01:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
whether that's in the air division Water
 
01:30:59.090 --> 01:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
Division or waste division follow-up
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
sure thank you so considering that you
 
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
currently don't have the bandwidth to
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
study what you would Define as communal
 
01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
cumulative impact analysis
 
01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day in in two years if
 
01:31:13.129 --> 01:31:13.139 align:start position:0%
there's a list of regulations that were
 
01:31:15.410 --> 01:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
presented to the legislature to adopt
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
what would the bandwidth required be for
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services to
 
01:31:22.490 --> 01:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
enforce those regulations on the
 
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
permitting process as it stands would
 
01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
you need 10 more additional staffers in
 
01:31:28.970 --> 01:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
three years 20 more I don't think we
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
know to be honest with you I mean I
 
01:31:33.290 --> 01:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
think we would probably Envision this
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
would be initially started as a
 
01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
temporary position it could likely
 
01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
become a permanent position in the
 
01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:39.290 align:start position:0%
become a permanent position in the
future

01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
depending on what comes out of the
 
01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:42.900 align:start position:0%
scoping study
 
01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
um and obviously anything that comes out
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
of that in terms of potential regulatory
 
01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
reforms or changes the department would
 
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
have to evaluate how to do that and what
 
01:31:54.649 --> 01:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
resources would be necessary at that
 
01:31:57.550 --> 01:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
time thank you I mean as I said before
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
this is somewhat of an unknown in terms
 
01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.169 --> 01:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
Ms Sweeney I would like to also answer
 
01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
uh your question is that we we don't
 
01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
have anyone who looks at the cumulative
 
01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
impacts but we we do have
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
um a federal agency starting to look at
 
01:32:21.290 --> 01:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
these cumulative impacts so we would
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
like to be in charge of our own destiny
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
here and bring our department in their
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
different silos and divisions that they
 
01:32:32.810 --> 01:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
have right now to have this
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
um this position be able to facilitate
 
01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:38.540 align:start position:0%
bringing that information all together
 
01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
particularly as stated in the
 
01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
legislation as it relates to Public
 
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
Health and that is some of the places
 
01:32:52.090 --> 01:32:52.100 align:start position:0%
where we have had some significant
 
01:32:54.649 --> 01:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
legislative legal
 
01:32:56.930 --> 01:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
issues in this day particularly with
 
01:33:01.729 --> 01:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
pfas and Benzene so we need to be
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the cumulative impacts of the
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
public health on
 
01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
future places that are facilities going
 
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
in which we're not doing right now so
 
01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
you know this is us taking control of
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
our our own space and our own
 
01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:19.970 align:start position:0%
our our own space and our own
information

01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative Deanne McGuire thank you
 
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman you said that this is kind
 
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
of a new area in that no other states
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
are really doing it yet the federal
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
government is just looking at it and so
 
01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:31.310 align:start position:0%
government is just looking at it and so
on

01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
so how are you going to be able to hire
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
someone with any kind of experience
 
01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
who's able to do this task
 
01:33:40.850 --> 01:33:40.860 align:start position:0%
that's obviously a great question I
 
01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say
 
01:33:44.450 --> 01:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
no other State's done anything there are
 
01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
several states that we're aware of that
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
are currently looking at this I know the
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts I know we all
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
don't love Massachusetts but they they
 
01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
have a legislative directed to look at
 
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
this and
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
where they chose to look first was
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
within their air program and in
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
particular they are our toxics program
 
01:34:05.330 --> 01:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
they're currently about 18 months into a
 
01:34:07.729 --> 01:34:07.739 align:start position:0%
two-year process to look at potential
 
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
changes to their program
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
I believe the state of Minnesota has
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
looked at cumulative impact so we would
 
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
go out there and look to see what has
 
01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
been done in this area I think we feel
 
01:34:20.450 --> 01:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
like we could hire somebody with a good
 
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
skill set that could do that type of
 
01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:25.070 align:start position:0%
skill set that could do that type of
work

01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
can you give us any example of some
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
environmental mishap
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
that has been occurred because we do not
 
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.050 align:start position:0%
that has been occurred because we do not
currently

01:34:38.050 --> 01:34:38.060 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
have this kind of Regulation is there is
 
01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
there something
 
01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
going on wrong somewhere that so all I
 
01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
can talk about is the way our current
 
01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
program let me just oh
 
01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
we didn't request DS didn't request the
 
01:34:55.010 --> 01:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
original Bill the amended Bill we had
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
concerns with the original bill
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
the new bill that came out of the Senate
 
01:35:01.010 --> 01:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
the department was neutral on but that
 
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
clearly took the position of if the
 
01:35:04.189 --> 01:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
legislature feels we want to go down
 
01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
this road we need the resources to do it
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and I forgot representative what was
 
01:35:12.169 --> 01:35:12.179 align:start position:0%
your specific question I previewed that
 
01:35:15.110 --> 01:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
give me an example of got it you know
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
somebody built this yep and and it was
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
permitted because it followed all the
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
rules but but it turned out to be a
 
01:35:26.050 --> 01:35:26.060 align:start position:0%
disaster because that so right probably
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
an easy example I could give you in the
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
air world because that's where I reside
 
01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:31.790 align:start position:0%
air world because that's where I reside
is

01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
under our current statute RSA 125i we
 
01:35:37.129 --> 01:35:37.139 align:start position:0%
regulate air toxics in New Hampshire we
 
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
have health-based standards for over 600
 
01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.030 align:start position:0%
have health-based standards for over 600
compounds

01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
compounds
 
01:35:43.610 --> 01:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
sources under the statute and the rules
 
01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:46.860 align:start position:0%
need to demonstrate that they comply at
 
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
their property boundary for those
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
individual pollutants on a gluten
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
specific basis
 
01:35:56.689 --> 01:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
it does not require the department to
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
look at if there's another facility
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
located next door emitting the same air
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
toxics we don't take that into
 
01:36:05.689 --> 01:36:05.699 align:start position:0%
consideration we only look at the
 
01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
individual Source at the property
 
01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:09.110 align:start position:0%
individual Source at the property
boundary

01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
boundary
 
01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
another thing we do currently do is we
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
regulate those 600 compounds on a
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
compound by compound basis in theory
 
01:36:18.410 --> 01:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
under this what you could require
 
01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
sources to look at would be I emit
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
compound one I meet that standard I emit
 
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
compound two I meet that standard but
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
what's the interaction between those two
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
compounds and how do you look at that
 
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
from a regulatory standpoint so I can't
 
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily say there's a failure but I
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
can say is there are certainly
 
01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
limitations to the existing program as
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
to how we review it and that's the type
 
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
of question we get from the public when
 
01:36:46.729 --> 01:36:46.739 align:start position:0%
we have public hearings what about that
 
01:36:46.739 --> 01:36:47.870 align:start position:0%
we have public hearings what about that
interaction

01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
01:36:50.209 --> 01:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
and that's a very simple
 
01:36:53.090 --> 01:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
as air comparison
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily a comparison of
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
potential I breathe one compound this
 
01:36:59.870 --> 01:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
way I drink something in my water this
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
way what's what's the impact of those
 
01:37:04.209 --> 01:37:04.219 align:start position:0%
two together so
 
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
representative grassy please followed by
 
01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler now just uh
 
01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
listening to what you've been talking
 
01:37:12.169 --> 01:37:12.179 align:start position:0%
about one of the comments was one of the
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
questions was asked about Staffing from
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing you saying is that once
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
you get this all developed this would
 
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
become part of what are the current
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
review standards that you have and so
 
01:37:25.850 --> 01:37:25.860 align:start position:0%
that the reviews would be done by
 
01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
Staffing that you currently have this
 
01:37:29.209 --> 01:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
would just be a different way of looking
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
at it or maybe some additional things
 
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
you have but you wouldn't need another
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
whole group of people to go out and do
 
01:37:36.770 --> 01:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
inspections just on this it would become
 
01:37:39.410 --> 01:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
part of your standard review process you
 
01:37:41.209 --> 01:37:41.219 align:start position:0%
may keep one person on to keep the
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
standards going but you know and improve
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
the standards but as far as inspections
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
I don't think you're going to be looking
 
01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
at doesn't seem to me from what you're
 
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
saying that you're going to need any
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
additional people
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know I can definitively say that
 
01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
I I will sit here and say because this
 
01:37:57.649 --> 01:37:57.659 align:start position:0%
is a scoping study and we don't know the
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
ultimate outcome of this
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
there could be those impacts down the
 
01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
road I I just I don't know until you go
 
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
through the process I don't know what I
 
01:38:08.890 --> 01:38:08.900 align:start position:0%
don't know at this point I have to admit
 
01:38:10.729 --> 01:38:10.739 align:start position:0%
representative Grant oh I'm sorry
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative when I respond to
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative grassy and referencing
 
01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
back to representative Evil's question
 
01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.370 align:start position:0%
back to representative Evil's question
that

01:38:19.370 --> 01:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:22.610 --> 01:38:22.620 align:start position:0%
um the original bill was not I was
 
01:38:25.729 --> 01:38:25.739 align:start position:0%
asking for an opportunity to participate
 
01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
in some rule making and it has
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
subsequently evolved into this scoping
 
01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
study because
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
it was we don't have the information on
 
01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts in order to make
 
01:38:45.649 --> 01:38:45.659 align:start position:0%
any kind of appropriate rules so this
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
scoping this person is going to be doing
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
that evaluation to see what what might
 
01:38:56.090 --> 01:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
we want to consider there is no
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that is coming out of this
 
01:39:01.090 --> 01:39:01.100 align:start position:0%
this is a specific
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
role within Des so we don't have any
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
legislation on deck that this is hoping
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
to bolster we don't have any rules on
 
01:39:12.590 --> 01:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
deck that this is hoping to bolster we
 
01:39:15.169 --> 01:39:15.179 align:start position:0%
don't have any legislation or rules that
 
01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
we are hoping this position will get rid
 
01:39:19.729 --> 01:39:19.739 align:start position:0%
of that is not the what this is about
 
01:39:23.709 --> 01:39:23.719 align:start position:0%
this is about taking those
 
01:39:26.890 --> 01:39:26.900 align:start position:0%
specifics um
 
01:39:30.169 --> 01:39:30.179 align:start position:0%
pieces of Des and being able to have one
 
01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
person look at the cumulative impacts
 
01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
from each of those divisions on the
 
01:39:39.649 --> 01:39:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
I still think this this leads to overly
 
01:39:45.649 --> 01:39:45.659 align:start position:0%
short-term thinking
 
01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
having watched some of the issues for at
 
01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
least 50 years and I can remember the
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
development of Peace Air Force Base and
 
01:39:57.169 --> 01:39:57.179 align:start position:0%
the nuclear power plant in Seabrook and
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
all the horrors that we were told to
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
expect from those developments all the
 
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
dangers anybody within 10 miles of that
 
01:40:07.729 --> 01:40:07.739 align:start position:0%
nuclear thing was going to be fried and
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
all this kind of thing and now
 
01:40:13.729 --> 01:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
here's the cumulative effects
 
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
big increases are in economy and both of
 
01:40:18.649 --> 01:40:18.659 align:start position:0%
the Two Towns affected by those
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
developments pay about a third of the
 
01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
property taxes that all the rest of us
 
01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
pay so there's sometimes cumulative
 
01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:28.679 align:start position:0%
effects that are positive but on the
 
01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
short term would have been turned down
 
01:40:32.209 --> 01:40:32.219 align:start position:0%
and there was a big move to do that so
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
we've got to realize that you know we
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
can't always standing be standing a
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
thwart progress and saying oh that might
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
be a problem that's what this reminds me
 
01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:42.110 align:start position:0%
be a problem that's what this reminds me
of

01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:44.689 --> 01:40:44.699 align:start position:0%
represent people
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair so it it strikes
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
me that the reason that the Senate uh
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
proceeded down this path and the reason
 
01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
that Ena recommended this 19-0 and the
 
01:40:59.930 --> 01:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
reason that everybody voted for it on
 
01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
the house floor is that this is an
 
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
incremental step to to sort of
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
understand better how to protect the
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
public health in the in these areas
 
01:41:12.189 --> 01:41:12.199 align:start position:0%
where these facilities are being
 
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
licensed I mean so many times you might
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
see uh legislation just introduced that
 
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
would call Deep call on Des to just
 
01:41:25.129 --> 01:41:25.139 align:start position:0%
regulate cumulative impacts period this
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
was an incremental step that
 
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
for people to look at whether it made
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
sense to do it this way and to actually
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
put money where our mouth is and finance
 
01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
the Des to look at it itself they are
 
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
the experts I mean another way to do it
 
01:41:44.689 --> 01:41:44.699 align:start position:0%
is a legislative study commission but it
 
01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
seems to me this really would put it in
 
01:41:50.930 --> 01:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
house it in the agency that is
 
01:41:53.689 --> 01:41:53.699 align:start position:0%
responsible for doing these things and
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
to me this just seems like a logical
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
approach I'm actually kind of horrified
 
01:42:01.609 --> 01:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
that we don't look more cumulative at
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
facilities that are being licensed that
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
are potential sources of pfas or pcbs or
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
so I just have a quick question
 
01:42:14.689 --> 01:42:14.699 align:start position:0%
following up on representative ebel's
 
01:42:16.850 --> 01:42:16.860 align:start position:0%
comments why wasn't a commission
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
considered and I think back of
 
01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
Representative evil was on a commission
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with solid waste and then this
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
division heard testimony and saw
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that we supported to provide
 
01:42:31.010 --> 01:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
some staffing based on the
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations of this commission where
 
01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
you could have someone from the planning
 
01:42:38.330 --> 01:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
Community des and put some money aside
 
01:42:40.490 --> 01:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily two hundred and
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars but to get a
 
01:42:45.169 --> 01:42:45.179 align:start position:0%
broader input from the public with a
 
01:42:47.169 --> 01:42:47.179 align:start position:0%
commission versus just having someone
 
01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
centered at the department to look at
 
01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:51.350 align:start position:0%
centered at the department to look at
this

01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
let's go
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
um thank you for asking for the Genesis
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:42:59.810 --> 01:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
um and to be to be clear
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
hiring this person at DES to look across
 
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
the agencies and across all of um
 
01:43:12.169 --> 01:43:12.179 align:start position:0%
the air water soil and look at Public
 
01:43:12.179 --> 01:43:13.330 align:start position:0%
the air water soil and look at Public
Health

01:43:13.330 --> 01:43:13.340 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
that first of all that would be a
 
01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
fascinating commission however
 
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
um we felt that public health
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
deserved a person who works in this
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
field full-time and that we could use
 
01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
the item the expertise that we have at
 
01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
DES and bring in someone who already
 
01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
does this kind of a value evaluative
 
01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:42.659 align:start position:0%
work again we're not Reinventing the
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
wheel we're not coming up with something
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
that other states aren't already doing
 
01:43:49.250 --> 01:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
this is actually something that many
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
many states are evaluating right now
 
01:43:56.689 --> 01:43:56.699 align:start position:0%
so that's why we want to do that do this
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
in this way and also
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
um again there's no legislation coming
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
so we don't this is not a legislative
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
study commission about future
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
legislation we're looking at Public
 
01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
Health impacts and some of the things
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
that we have seen the public health be
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
impacted by is only after the fact
 
01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
like with pfas and with Benzene so
 
01:44:27.709 --> 01:44:27.719 align:start position:0%
what we are trying to do is get in front
 
01:44:31.729 --> 01:44:31.739 align:start position:0%
of that so that we can possibly create
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
our own rules and create our and that
 
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
would be the preference is to go through
 
01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:39.550 align:start position:0%
would be the preference is to go through
rulemaking

01:44:39.550 --> 01:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
so that we are protecting our Public
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
Health which either we protect our
 
01:44:47.209 --> 01:44:47.219 align:start position:0%
Public Health we pay for it on the other
 
01:44:49.729 --> 01:44:49.739 align:start position:0%
end this is a this is a preventative
 
01:44:49.739 --> 01:44:51.590 align:start position:0%
end this is a this is a preventative
measure

01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
measure
 
01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:52.970 align:start position:0%
measure
oh

01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank you see no further questions the
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
division is a couple of things I'm sorry
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative Carol McGuire
 
01:45:01.729 --> 01:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:05.450 --> 01:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm really concerned that it just
 
01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
says facility without any definition and
 
01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:11.689 align:start position:0%
says facility without any definition and
I'm

01:45:11.689 --> 01:45:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.609 --> 01:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to interpret that and I
 
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
don't know how the person who we would
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
get to do this study
 
01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:20.030 align:start position:0%
get to do this study
um

01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
we Des permits so many different kinds
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
of facilities under so many different
 
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
laws what which ones do you start with
 
01:45:32.209 --> 01:45:32.219 align:start position:0%
where do you pick what's the what kind
 
01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
of facilities are you talking about
 
01:45:35.450 --> 01:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
regulating I mean if you're talking
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
about a power plant
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but you permit a whole
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
lot less significant items as well so
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
again this bill doesn't propose any
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
regulations nor is it asking nor is it
 
01:45:50.639 --> 01:45:51.890 align:start position:0%
regulations nor is it asking nor is it
asking

01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
asking
 
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
um this person that's hired to propose
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
regulations that is not in the scope of
 
01:46:00.729 --> 01:46:00.739 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill is to hire somebody
 
01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
to study what the cumulative impacts are
 
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
in the areas of air water and soil
 
01:46:17.169 --> 01:46:17.179 align:start position:0%
pollution it's like that's and studying
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts is the bare basic the
 
01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:23.820 align:start position:0%
bare basic right now we don't do that
 
01:46:25.450 --> 01:46:25.460 align:start position:0%
I I I
 
01:46:28.669 --> 01:46:28.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate your enthusiasm about the
 
01:46:31.609 --> 01:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
subject but I think that this without
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
further definition of what on Earth this
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
person is going to be looking into you
 
01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
have no idea what's going to come out of
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
it and because
 
01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.750 align:start position:0%
it and because
yeah

01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:46:47.689 --> 01:46:47.699 align:start position:0%
and also this person is reviewing and
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
planning for the development of
 
01:46:51.890 --> 01:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
definitions and standards as it relates
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
to cumulative impact
 
01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
definitions and standards are what you
 
01:46:59.570 --> 01:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
use to make laws and rules I mean they
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
will not be this person will not be
 
01:47:03.169 --> 01:47:03.179 align:start position:0%
making the laws and rules but they'll be
 
01:47:05.930 --> 01:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
giving us the framework that somebody
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
will be proposing laws and or rules on
 
01:47:11.450 --> 01:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
otherwise why bother
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
if they say that our current unless this
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
person comes in and says our current
 
01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
analyzes and requirements are perfect
 
01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to worry about which I
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
would not believe I'd love to see that
 
01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
happen but I don't believe it they're
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
going to come in with more requirements
 
01:47:30.890 --> 01:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
and more regulations and we're going to
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
have to bring them into law or rules or
 
01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:34.570 align:start position:0%
have to bring them into law or rules or
both

01:47:34.570 --> 01:47:34.580 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned that this is a giant
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
fishing Expedition for more
 
01:47:41.629 --> 01:47:41.639 align:start position:0%
environmental regulations
 
01:47:43.729 --> 01:47:43.739 align:start position:0%
representative evil has a question on
 
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
the ranking member representative
 
01:47:47.689 --> 01:47:47.699 align:start position:0%
McGuire would like the Republican
 
01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
Secaucus in the back room I just
 
01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
wondered is facility defined in your
 
01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
statutes or by regulation so I would I
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
would venture to Guess that regulated
 
01:48:00.890 --> 01:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
facilities are Divine defined by Statute
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
by Statute or by rule by rule all right
 
01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
I was trying to find it quickly and I
 
01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't I mean there's not a single
 
01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
definition of facility across the
 
01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
department I mean we have
 
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
a number of licenses and permits that we
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
issue as an agency and the regulated
 
01:48:18.830 --> 01:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
entity under each one of those programs
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
is defined within that program
 
01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
and may I follow up on that yeah so this
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
I just noticed I mean this is not
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
statute law this is chapter law right so
 
01:48:34.250 --> 01:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
this is a standalone thing it is not
 
01:48:36.770 --> 01:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
part of air or part of water or
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
something like that right this is a
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
one-time stand-alone piece so it is what
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:52.080 --> 01:51:46.570 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:51:46.570 --> 01:51:46.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:50.209 --> 01:51:50.219 align:start position:0%
okay I believe uh emotion is going to be
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
offered by representative evil okay
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair based on the
 
01:51:58.729 --> 01:51:58.739 align:start position:0%
based on the questions that are
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
revolving around the word facility and
 
01:52:04.370 --> 01:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
other concerns that have been expressed
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
and maybe we'd have the opportunity to
 
01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
look a little bit more into this
 
01:52:11.629 --> 01:52:11.639 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts issue I'd like to
 
01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
make a motion to retain second
 
01:52:17.450 --> 01:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
