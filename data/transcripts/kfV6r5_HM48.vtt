offered

00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
offered
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
i in my 15 years of committee work
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
i have never been through such a
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
hearing as we had at one point i thought
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
i understood the process
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
or what the issue was and then to find
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
an entirely different side to that
 
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
i have since that hearing seen many
 
00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:36.389 align:start position:0%
i have since that hearing seen many
emails

00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
emails
 
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:39.919 align:start position:0%
and people have called for conversations
 
00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:40.230 align:start position:0%
and people have called for conversations
uh

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm of the opinion that if we are to
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
retain this
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh with the energy that's out there uh
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
that i believe this is a
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
could come to a resolution without us
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
having to take action
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh but i vow if if that is not the case
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
and it does not happen before we bring
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
this up
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh then i certainly will be in favor of
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
a different motion
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh so i'm i'm in favor of what is uh
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
being brought forward
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
i will vote in support of that mr
 
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.550 align:start position:0%
i will vote in support of that mr
chairman

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
representative philadelphia
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah now you're good
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
i am totally against this i i am i am
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
for the senate bill
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
i definitely want to end this i think
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
the state should
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
never never be in the position where
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
they're telling a town how to spend
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
their tax dollars period i don't think
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's the way i'm going to vote i just
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
think it's wrong
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
and i will be voting against you
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
has representative kozinski made it to
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
your house yet clifford uh
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
no i'm still waiting for him as soon as
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
he if he shows up i'll
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
get him right on so we can verify he's
 
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.430 align:start position:0%
get him right on so we can verify he's
here

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you maybe this
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
is a question towards the chair not
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily the supporters of the
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
retention motion
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
if this committee votes to retain this
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill what do you foresee as a process
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
for going through retention could you've
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
got someone have you got some ideas yeah
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
as i've said at other forums
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
my intention on this would be to have a
 
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.430 align:start position:0%
my intention on this would be to have a
subcommittee

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
of six three republicans three democrats
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
i don't get volunteers there's always
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
the draft
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
um to work on this
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
through we can actually start in june
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
um and part of july august the speaker
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
usually says no work
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
but by mid september
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
third fourth week in september i would
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
expect a report from that subcommittee
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
so that the entire committee could meet
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
and discuss this in october because we
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
report out at the end of october
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
roughly um to the entire house for
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
a vote in january that would be my
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
intention and i'm sure that i would get
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
people to to volunteer for
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
that little bit of additional work um
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
it may come back with not a great
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation or no recommendation
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
but i think that we need to do that way
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative dude yeah so i'm going to
 
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:57.990 align:start position:0%
representative dude yeah so i'm going to
uh

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
vote against the motion that's brought
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
forward i don't think we should kick the
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
can down the road here it was a 20-3
 
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.590 align:start position:0%
can down the road here it was a 20-3
vote

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
out of the senate i think this bill is
 
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.110 align:start position:0%
out of the senate i think this bill is
necessary

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
and i think the sooner that we get it
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
and pass it on to the governor the
 
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.110 align:start position:0%
and pass it on to the governor the
better

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um this is just
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
everybody else this is not a partisan
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
issue um
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
there are members of the committee on
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
both sides of the issue
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
of the issue in both parties um so
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
i fully respect how people are going to
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
vote represent places
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes i just want to say i agree with
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative newton um
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
i don't see how this gets better by you
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
know kind of waiting it out
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
so i i will also vote against the vote
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
voting against the motion for that
 
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.870 align:start position:0%
voting against the motion for that
reason

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:12:50.880 --> 00:13:02.470 align:start position:0%
reason
all

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
i think of the other thing
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
is that i know nowhere else in new
 
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.750 align:start position:0%
is that i know nowhere else in new
hampshire

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
where there were similar funding and
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
formula issues
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
involved i think that uh
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
in my world i only know
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
of the village we live in the town of
 
00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:42.310 align:start position:0%
of the village we live in the town of
winchester

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
winchester
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
and the village of spafford in the town
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
of chesterfield
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
and i represent
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
chesterfield in the state of walpole
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
along with representative weber of
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
representatives first
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
representative it would be similar
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
because the disproportionate number
 
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
of the amount of property tax
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
raised in chesterfield
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
comes largely from those
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
homes that have frontage on spotlight
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
it would be as if the folks came to me
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
and asked for legislation where they
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
would get a portion of the property tax
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
and retire from those homes i certainly
 
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
would not sponsor such
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
legislation i don't think it's our
 
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.269 align:start position:0%
legislation i don't think it's our
business

00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
and i think that the other part
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
the only place where the state should be
 
00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:48.790 align:start position:0%
the only place where the state should be
involved

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
in these matters is with the department
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
of president administration
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
in the audits which they've been
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
conducted and which i don't
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
show necessarily malfeasance on the
 
00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.430 align:start position:0%
show necessarily malfeasance on the
woodsville

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
woodsville
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
fire district but certainly big proper
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not an attorney
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
i'm not a certified public accountant
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
but i don't
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
they suggest mediation that has
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
not been successful in the past and i
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
think that what should happen
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
again is that this builder ought to pass
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
and move us from
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
the situation thank you thank you
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
um if you don't mind i'd like to defer
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
until i hear what representative
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
faulkner shares as far as his views on
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
the subject thank you
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chairman knight let me
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
find myself in a
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
mistake minority but i looked at this
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
quite carefully i think this has been
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
mischaracterized as money
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
being raised by the rest of the town
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
going to going to the village of
 
00:16:21.199 --> 00:16:22.470 align:start position:0%
going to going to the village of
woodsville

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
woodsville
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
if you look at carefully where the money
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
comes from where it goes the money
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's raised in woodsville goes to
 
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.829 align:start position:0%
that's raised in woodsville goes to
woodsville

00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
woodsville
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
raised for highway purposes goes to
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
woodsville and the money raised
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
elsewhere goes to the town's highway
 
00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:36.389 align:start position:0%
elsewhere goes to the town's highway
department

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
the bill is as it stands down the
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
statute as it now stands basically
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
is an endorsement of a
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
agreement that came to us
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
11 years ago uh
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
because the formula for dividing up this
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
money has been
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
changed slightly over that time but
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
essentially we're not dictating
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
a formula where you are you know
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
including in the
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
statute the formula that was brought to
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
us by an agreement between the parties
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
and this is the way it's going to happen
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
for all these village districts i mean
 
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.350 align:start position:0%
for all these village districts i mean
that

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
the state does tell them how how to
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
raise their money uh
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
you know as a practical matter maybe
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
other ways to do this
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
i would be happy to see a different
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
agreement come out
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that we can impose one
 
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.430 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that we can impose one
party's

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
party's
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
view of the agreement on on the two
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
parties without having
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
the then go through a process of
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
mediation and
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
in an open and fair negotiation
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh we're just basically picking one
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
party versus the other
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
have the information to indicate that
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
that's the right
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
right way to go so i'm i certainly be in
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
favor of retaining if this
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
retention vote doesn't uh doesn't
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
succeed i'm going to vote against the
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
bill as a whole thank you
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you i just anyway um
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
so like all of us i've looked at this
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
quite a bit in particular i looked at
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
legislative history going back to you
 
00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:35.590 align:start position:0%
legislative history going back to you
know

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
pre-dawn aid or and i also
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
looked at the litigation summaries i
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
the previous iteration of this bill
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
included in hb 1234 that was vetoed by
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
it was introduced in the same way
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
by senator gaida i would not have uh
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
supported that version and that
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
was uh um combining
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
by statute uh woodsville
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
and and haverhill and i don't think that
 
00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:07.830 align:start position:0%
and and haverhill and i don't think that
that's

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
the right approach i realized that it's
 
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.870 align:start position:0%
the right approach i realized that it's
historical

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
historical
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
that we've been as much involved in what
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
is going on up there
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
as as we have been
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
and i think in 1990 we were trying to
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
help in 2009
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
with the current formulation that's in
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
the next time if they come up with
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
another formulation
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
if we put it in the statute we'd be
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
trying to help and then they'd be back
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
to us perhaps at another time
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
and i really think that they should be
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
negotiating out themselves
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
what their deals are over time
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
as property values change as
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
relationships change
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
i don't see how that is
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
helped by retaining the bill i mean
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
i realize that they're in litigation the
 
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.590 align:start position:0%
i realize that they're in litigation the
litigation

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
is actually analyzing um how the parties
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
have related
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
under the current statute if the parties
 
00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:17.350 align:start position:0%
under the current statute if the parties
negotiate

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
negotiate
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
another formulation i couldn't
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
in good faith support including that
 
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.310 align:start position:0%
in good faith support including that
formulation

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
formulation
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the statute because it could change
 
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:27.990 align:start position:0%
in the statute because it could change
again

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
the if if we pass this and i will say
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of passage
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
um it has to go through the process
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
it'll go to the governor the governor
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
probably won't have deal with it until
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
maybe july or later
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
i don't see that we're helping one side
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
or the other by
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
not passing this at this point because
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
a matter of local control and i think
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
where it should be i don't see the
 
00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:06.870 align:start position:0%
where it should be i don't see the
state's

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
state's
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
these two parties don't need a parent
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
straightening things out for them they
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with it on their own and and
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
just be subject to
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
the other laws that apply to village
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
districts which i know very little bit
 
00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.430 align:start position:0%
districts which i know very little bit
about

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
but um that's where so i'll be voting
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
against the motion to retain
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
oh that was true all right that was very
 
00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:42.830 align:start position:0%
oh that was true all right that was very
good

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.230 align:start position:0%
good
foreign

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
to retain i agree with everybody this
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
does nothing to fix this problem
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
and this problem does need to be fixed
 
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
no matter what the formula
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
happens to be in any kind of agreement
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
that they work out
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
they should work that formula out and it
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
should not be in
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
a state statute it should be liquid
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
enough that they can change it
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
as necessary as property taxes and
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
situations changed
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
retaining this as far as waiting for the
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
court case
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
the court case will more than likely go
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
into mediation but the mediation
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
is and the court case is only about
 
00:22:21.919 --> 00:22:22.710 align:start position:0%
is and the court case is only about
dollars

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
that are currently owed interpreting
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
this statute the way it is right now it
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
does nothing
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
to fix this problem so once again i am
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
against the uh retaining motion
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%

00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's emotional passes with a vote of
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
to 3. of those who voted
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
no is there any objection
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
to the consent calendar is there still a
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
rule about no more than two no votes
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
there that was always unofficial there
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
is no money involved
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
it can go on to the it's the consent
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
calendar it's unusual
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
but the speaker has strongly suggested
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
we put as many as possible
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
but that having been said i am going to
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
put it on the regular calendar as i
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
think about it i am sure that
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative flad
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
who testified against the bill will want
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
to speak about it
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
and so we'll just put it in its regular
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
place in the calendar
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
rather than at the end of the calendar
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
as it gets pulled off of
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
um consent so we'll be on the regular
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
calendar as i think this story
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
um this has been
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
one of the harder um as representative
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
mcconkey said one of
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
the harder bills that we have had in
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
this committee not
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
within the house and i want to thank
 
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.149 align:start position:0%
within the house and i want to thank
everybody

00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
for their um diligence and looking at
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
all of the information that was sent to
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
us listening to the two hours of
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes acrimonious testimony um
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
and i think that um majority committee
 
00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:19.510 align:start position:0%
and i think that um majority committee
police

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
we're doing the right thing and that is
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
why we are here to make
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the house that said
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
um we have no
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
other bills to come before us or
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
executive sessions
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
for this year of
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
the biennium we will probably
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
have a committee of conference
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 25 capital budget
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
because i i having listened to all of
 
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.750 align:start position:0%
because i i having listened to all of
the

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
agency presentations and the senate
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
questions and comments

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.470 align:start position:0%
one of those four days i did have so
much

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
how did the hearing on the capitol
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
budget go yes sir
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
the hearing the public hearing on house
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
bill 25 was held at 10 am
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday it was after as we did it was
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
after all of the agency presentations
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
there was one speaker in favor and that
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
was me
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
because i introduced the bill there was
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
nobody else who spoke
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
and as you can imagine because we heard
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
some of the same pleas from
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
agencies agencies asked for additional
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
money which they are now weighing
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
as they go forward into their work
 
00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:26.630 align:start position:0%
as they go forward into their work
sessions

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
and executive sessions my understanding
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at the senate calendar there
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
will probably be
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
a senate meeting on the capitol budget
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
their capital budget committee
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
next tuesday which you can
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
zoom in and listen to if you so
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%

00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
thank all of the committee for
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
this year's work um that we have had on
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
the bills we haven't had a lot of bills
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
but it's been trickier trying to do it
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
in this hybrid fashion
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
um because we miss the the camaraderie
 
00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:04.549 align:start position:0%
um because we miss the the camaraderie
around

00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
the tables of of talking to each other
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
and and probably asking more questions
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
of people who are
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
presenting but um thank you all
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
okay just one final question on the
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
capital budget if we decide to form a
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
committee conference to vote
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%

00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
before you know the june 10th session is
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%

00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:43.990 align:start position:0%
let the committee know what my thoughts
are

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
on committee of conference once i find
 
00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.350 align:start position:0%
on committee of conference once i find
out

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
what the senate has done um
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
as former chairs who are sitting around
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
here know
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
it is my decision uh whether or not to
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
to recommend to the house uh what to do
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
but if you know 22 of the committee
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to go that route
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
i'd be kind of silly to to do that
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
