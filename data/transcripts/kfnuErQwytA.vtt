I am Michael Cahill all right A Little
 
00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 align:start position:0%
Closer okay good I am uh representative
 
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
Michael Cahill from Newmarket I
 
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Newfield and New
 
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
Market in Rockingham 10.
 
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
and I'm here before you today as I had
 
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.310 align:start position:0%
and I'm here before you today as I had
been

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
in other occasions to talk about school
 
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
building Aid uh you're many of you are
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
aware this is a long-standing problem uh
 
00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by the uh bonding of State
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
funds due to the recession and the
 
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 align:start position:0%
moratorium and the fact that the
 
00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.029 align:start position:0%
moratorium and the fact that the
moratorium

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
moratorium
 
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
halted payments but it didn't halt you
 
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
know deteriorating conditions in our
 
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.550 align:start position:0%
know deteriorating conditions in our
schools

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.230 align:start position:0%
schools
so

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
um with HB
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
332 I would like to address
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
really both sides of the equation I
 
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
would like to change the 50 million
 
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
dollar maximum spend
 
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
to 60 million minimum spent
 
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
and and this should be I erred on the
 
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
the drafting somehow this would be this
 
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
inclusive of the debt payment we still
 
00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
have to pay down the debt so I'm not
 
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
asking pay the debt I mean it would be
 
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
great if you did pay down the debt and
 
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
do 60 million but let's be realistic
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
so 60 million minimum now the five of
 
00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 align:start position:0%
the five of the extra million would go
 
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
to help us
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
with pending projects so that we
 
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
wouldn't lengthen that list right now we
 
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
have 17 projects for the current
 
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
biennium and Only Money enough for three
 
00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
so that that's kind of sustains the
 
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
problem rather than you know rather than
 
00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 align:start position:0%
lowering the problem and then we had the
 
00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 align:start position:0%
issue of the the many projects that went
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
forward during the moratorium those that
 
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
couldn't wait you know it was supposed
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
to be a two-year moratorium and then it
 
00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
was extended and extended again
 
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
and some of you will find that uh
 
00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
schools in your districts were involved
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
were you know we're in that group
 
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
mine certainly was
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
and you know taxpayers agree they voted
 
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
you know they had to had to get 60 60
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know approval and we did that it was
 
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.969 align:start position:0%
you know approval and we did that it was
painful

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
painful
 
00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
uh they were still paying for it now
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
extra money you know on the tax bill and
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
this was you know the school building a
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
program was something that worked pretty
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
well for decades and then it was
 
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
abandoned you know we've had ran into
 
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
some hard times and we restored restored
 
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
it a bit with some emergency and then we
 
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
went a little bit further but the uh the
 
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:38.759 align:start position:0%
tail is a problem and the limit on the
 
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
maximum of 50 million is certainly a
 
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
problem and I think we need to do
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
something with this this is another kind
 
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
of infrastructure and uh as a note I've
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
also reached out to the Gopher committee
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
because there is some federal money left
 
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to see that applied to some
 
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
place I think probably the best chance
 
00:07:58.969 --> 00:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
would be to help us uh shorten that
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
pending project list a bit
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
but the retroactive I know that hasn't
 
00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:07.139 align:start position:0%
uh caught much favor in the past but
 
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
those people are you know those people
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
are educating the children in their
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
districts in the schools that needed
 
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
needed to be renovated or repaired and
 
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
it was done we did it and we acted in
 
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
good faith and I'd like to see the state
 
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire recognize that and I'm
 
00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
only asking for half of the grand amount
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking you to pay the whole cost
 
00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
like we did
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
in New Market and in Auburn and and so
 
00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:32.459 align:start position:0%
many other places around the the state
 
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
I'm asking for half of the money
 
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
and there's a formula that Amy Clark
 
00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
recommended which takes into account uh
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
the property values the income and the
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
wealth the general ability to pay that's
 
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
one approach where you're paying the the
 
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
more needy communities first another
 
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
would be you know uh first in first out
 
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
but I'll leave that to the wisdom of the
 
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
finance committee but but I am looking
 
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
for a commitment to to fund it and to
 
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
fund it year after year so that we can
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
not have these long lists of people who
 
00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
are you know left to their own devices
 
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
in the effort to provide good education
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
good facilities to attract young
 
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
families to keep to hiring retained
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
teachers we need to be doing those
 
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.250 align:start position:0%
teachers we need to be doing those
things

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cahill do you
 
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
by chance have anything written that you
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
could give the clerk I I have a bunch of
 
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
copies here and more being worked on and
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
I did send an email with the again I
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
thought this was division two
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
and so I only asked for nine copies and
 
00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:39.959 align:start position:0%
I realized no that's not nearly enough
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
all right make sure the clerk gets one
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
and and we can have other we can have
 
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
copies made for the rest of the
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
committee when you give them to Mr
 
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
landrika thank you for your Indulgence
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question I thought I heard you
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
say that you want the 60 million dollars
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
um to be less any debt payments but the
 
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
way I read this it's it's the other way
 
00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:11.339 align:start position:0%
around is that right the bill was that
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
was an error I I you know I'm not sure
 
00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:15.779 align:start position:0%
how that got in there I think I think
 
00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:17.339 align:start position:0%
you might see it on that on some of the
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
other bills today but uh representative
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
Heath to your immediate left has
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
graciously agreed to submit an amendment
 
00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:27.779 align:start position:0%
uh to undo that if necessary so thank
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
a little bit we can expect an amendment
 
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
to be brought to division two yes yes
 
00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:37.550 align:start position:0%
to be brought to division two yes yes
sir

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
and I guess representative Heath will
 
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
take care of that thank you thank you so
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
much for the questions from committee
 
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
members representative Edwards I'll
 
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
defer to anyone in division two but I I
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
do have three questions just so that I
 
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
can learn a little bit
 
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
um okay uh I I I think these are
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
friendly questions representative Cahill
 
00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:00.899 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm just looking for clarity
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
I I think I heard you say that
 
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
um there are 17 projects on the list of
 
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019 align:start position:0%
which we have plans to fund three of
 
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
them and then I think I heard you say
 
00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:14.579 align:start position:0%
that you would like us to be able to
 
00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:17.579 align:start position:0%
take some of the new money and apply it
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
to new projects instead of continuing to
 
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
work the existing priority list for
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's those 17. did I hear you
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
correctly no I I think you heard me but
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted my my intent was that we
 
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
would we would not invite I know there
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
will be more projects coming in years to
 
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
come but work on some more of that seven
 
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
the other remaining 14 to the extent
 
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
that we can with whatever arpa money is
 
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.730 align:start position:0%
that we can with whatever arpa money is
provided

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
provided
 
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
okay so as I as I generally understand
 
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
the way we were oh I'm sorry uh
 
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.850 align:start position:0%
the way we were oh I'm sorry uh
follow-up

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:53.339 align:start position:0%
so so as I generally understand
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
um how this works is we have this
 
00:11:59.090 --> 00:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
priority list of 17 if we have an a new
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
project or some crisis occurs on one of
 
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
the yet to be funded projects then
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
there's the ability to to move that
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
project to the front of the line for
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
exigent reasons are you asking for
 
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
anything different than that uh thank
 
00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:19.019 align:start position:0%
you for the question uh no I'm I'm I
 
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
trust those who did the ranking on the
 
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
list I'm just adding trying to add money
 
00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
okay you know to the to the fund uh
 
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
through the extra extra 5 million you
 
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
know the directive board 60 million so
 
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
it's a five of that would direct it
 
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
toward lowering reducing that list and
 
00:12:41.569 --> 00:12:41.579 align:start position:0%
hopefully some multi-million uh from the
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
arpa go for money would make a big
 
00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:46.019 align:start position:0%
difference thank you Mr chair second
 
00:12:46.019 --> 00:12:47.629 align:start position:0%
difference thank you Mr chair second
question

00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
no no yeah it just feels like it uh so
 
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
um I I I think you're asking for retro
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
activity uh and and I know uh with my
 
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
constituents in Auburn they'd love some
 
00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:05.459 align:start position:0%
unanticipated money to to reimburse for
 
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
the 13 million dollar bond that we did a
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
few years ago do we have a history of
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
retroactively funding projects that
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
local districts had approved and
 
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
accepted the the commitment that they
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
were getting into do we have any
 
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
precedent for for a retroactive School
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
building Aid uh I'm I have not
 
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019 align:start position:0%
researched that I would certainly be
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
glad to look further I I know that the
 
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
on the other Branch the executive
 
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.370 align:start position:0%
on the other Branch the executive
Council

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
Council
 
00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
routinely approves uh contracts
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
revisions retroactively so it's not like
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
an unfamiliar term in this in the uh in
 
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
the building
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh the problem was that you know as as
 
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
you know that your school needed work
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
and the state wasn't funding it uh the
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
state is in a better position now than
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
they were and I'd like to see your
 
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
constituents in line uh get some of the
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement back roughly half of the
 
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
of the amount that would have been given
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
to them and I think that would be a fair
 
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
thing to do okay and then my third and
 
00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:14.579 align:start position:0%
final question if I might this is just a
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
coordination question I I know that uh
 
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang is proposing a bill I'm
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
just uh what what he's wanting the
 
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
school building Aid to focus on is
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
helping districts that need to
 
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
consolidate and so my question is are
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
you and Senator Lang uh talking and and
 
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
trying to smooth your bills or or do you
 
00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
see these as in Conflict uh I
 
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
I haven't uh I we had some emails back
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
and forth I hadn't seen his bill uh
 
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
they're not really in Conflict there has
 
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
been an incentive for districts to uh to
 
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
consolidate where possible I believe
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
there was an extra five percent for
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
every sending Community which I had kind
 
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
of mixed feelings about that
 
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
um but there are places that can't
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
consolidate maybe you don't want your
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
first grader on an hour bus ride each
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
way there are places where it's not
 
00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
practical and so and those for those of
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
us who are in single school districts we
 
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
like it that way and we we've built it
 
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
that way and I know it works for us and
 
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that's true of a few other
 
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:24.260 align:start position:0%
places around the state
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh and we we you know we did look at
 
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
sending some of the kids elsewhere and
 
00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:31.139 align:start position:0%
we had an opportunity to send a few of
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
them to Oyster River uh but that was
 
00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
only a few you know so we we've been
 
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
around this you know and for us it was
 
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
uh best to stay with our K through a
 
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
sort of pre-K now uh through 12 right in
 
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
New Market
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for that thank you
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
members representative
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
taking the questions could you clarify
 
00:15:59.689 --> 00:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
the language in paragraph B Because when
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
you described it you said you know 5
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
million would go to retroactive funding
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
the way I read the language is at least
 
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:08.180 align:start position:0%
half and potentially the Empire increase
 
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:10.740 align:start position:0%
could you clarify what the intent of the
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
language is right uh the the 60 million
 
00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:17.339 align:start position:0%
is the minimum that we would spend each
 
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
each year
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
so there's flexibility to spend 62 or 70
 
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
million if we're really flush but I'm
 
00:16:26.689 --> 00:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
asking for uh
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
half of the extra money
 
00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
because you know basically 10 million
 
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
which would be half of that would be
 
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
five so again I suppose it wouldn't be
 
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
out of the question if we had if we were
 
00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:40.019 align:start position:0%
swimming in money and we wanted to get
 
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
this done to to speed up the payments uh
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
for the current projects and to the
 
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
retroactive such as yours and mine
 
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
follow up if I may follow up
 
00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
I I would appreciate our clarification
 
00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
because the languages I read it does not
 
00:16:59.689 --> 00:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
say 5 million it says at least 5 million
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
and I I want to understand your intent
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
because obviously we will need to uh
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
figure out the best way to finalize this
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
bill and I I it's important for me to
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
understand what your intent is I I
 
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the question
 
00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.870 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the question
um

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:17.339 align:start position:0%
let me look back it does say at least
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
five right at least
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
well yes I think what we're thinking
 
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
here is that of the additional funds at
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
least five million yes it could be um
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
if if that is a problem for the
 
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
committee it could certainly be you know
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
limited to 5 million or you could leave
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
it at at least so that you have
 
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
flexibility in budgets going forward
 
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
it's going I realize that we have to do
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
we have to look at the money we have
 
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
available in each biennium and allocate
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
those funds and not more than that
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
so there's some flexibility here but if
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
that is an anathema to the committee I
 
00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
leave you you know up to you to Define
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
work more clearly if that is your
 
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
pleasure thank you
 
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess division two will will work
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
representative leishman uh thank you Mr
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and perhaps representative
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
Cahill you said this and I missed it how
 
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
did you arrive at the 60 million dollars
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
versus another number like the old 50
 
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars well thank you for the
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
question I believe 50 million uh as
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
we've seen is is inadequate because we
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
do have 17 projects and we can only fund
 
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.830 align:start position:0%
do have 17 projects and we can only fund
three

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
and uh the next by your name I don't
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
think that would improve the ratio so I
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
think it needs to have some more money
 
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
added there may be I think there are
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
other bills that ask for substantially
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
more I'm trying to look at what is
 
00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:44.990 align:start position:0%
more I'm trying to look at what is
possible

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
and perhaps passable by asking for
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
60 million instead of 50.
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cahill thank
 
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
I have a pink card from another sponsor
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
finance committee for the record I am
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
state representative John Cloutier from
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County district 6 which
 
00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
comprises the communities of Claremont
 
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
and Croydon and I'm here today as a
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and in strong support of
 
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
332 relatives to school building a
 
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the prime sponsor
 
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
asking me to be his co-sponsor because
 
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
he and I have had a conversations for
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
years about the whole school building
 
00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:48.539 align:start position:0%
Aid issue and I know he's had challenges
 
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
in in Mike and his community and in my
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
community we've had challenges too
 
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
and let me relate one of the reasons
 
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
that why I'm a co-sponsor and I know one
 
00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:00.299 align:start position:0%
of my other Claremont colleagues is also
 
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor that we had to renovate our
 
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
high school some years back
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
and basically if Stevens High School
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
which is the public high school for
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
Claremont did not get renovated it could
 
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
have lost its accreditation uh which can
 
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
cause problems for graduates and and
 
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
just the whole community so the school
 
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
board and the communities try to do
 
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
something about it and I remember in
 
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.169 align:start position:0%
something about it and I remember in
2009

00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
2009
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
we tried to pass a bond we had to get 60
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
percent and the bond issue lost by just
 
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
one vote
 
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
which at least proved a point to me when
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
people complained hey make sure make
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
sure next time you get out and vote if
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
you didn't every vote counts there was
 
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
it excuse me it passed by one vote and
 
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
then there was a recount and if then it
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
lost the 60 percent by one vote
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
and so if we had passed in 2009 we could
 
00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
have gotten some building Aid as I
 
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
understand it so the school board in
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
trying to win more support because they
 
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
didn't prefer to pass comfortably they
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
went back downscale they tried to reduce
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
some of the cost and they did that and
 
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
then I believe it was in 2011 they came
 
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
back to the voters and we passed that
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
bond issue that time with a comfortable
 
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:21.020 align:start position:0%
margin the problem is a few months later
 
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:24.919 align:start position:0%
we in the legislature and then Governor
 
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
you know basically shut the window on
 
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
building it they cut it out of the
 
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
budget because we had had to make
 
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
massive budget cuts in order to balance
 
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
the budget and that's fine we've got to
 
00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
do our cons meet our constitutional
 
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
obligation that no one you know wanted
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
to raise any Revenue it was just after
 
00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
and the problem is the City of Claremont
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
or the Claremont School just had to bear
 
00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
that burden of renovating the Stevens
 
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
High School totally on its own and
 
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
that's why we became the community with
 
00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
the hot highest property tax rates in
 
00:21:59.450 --> 00:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
the state for a while we had to go go It
 
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
Alone in renovating Stevens High School
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
and I think this bill is a start it's
 
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
part of a conversation I know some
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
people don't like the retroactive
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
feature but it's not gonna it's not
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
asking for everything but it's asking
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
for a small piece back to help us in
 
00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:18.059 align:start position:0%
Claremont uh make sure that we have and
 
00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
it is a beautiful building I remember in
 
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
2013 after we did it then Governor
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
Hassan came and helped us dedicate it I
 
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
just wish you could have brought us some
 
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
money but you know her hands were tied
 
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
but the point and this is not a real
 
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
partisan issue because I was here we had
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
as a democratic legislature and then a
 
00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:39.299 align:start position:0%
Republican election and a Democratic
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
governor throughout had to deal with the
 
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
Great Recession and the problems on the
 
00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
state's revenues but I think we need to
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
now look at this again and communities
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
like Claremont maybe give them a little
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
bit of help and granted this bill I
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
think is a modest bill it's not going to
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
give them everything it's going to give
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
them half and it allocates just up to
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
five million dollars per fiscal year and
 
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
I think it's it would be helpful for
 
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
communities like whether it's New Market
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
or Claremont or any other communities
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
that face have faced these struggles and
 
00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
funded these projects within the time
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
period of July 1st 2009 and June 30th
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
2019 which which Claremont meets as I
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
described in my testimony and I think
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
you know it was a 16 million dollar
 
00:23:30.649 --> 00:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
project and if we could have gotten some
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
building Aid according to this chart
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
that I have I believe the state could
 
00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:35.830 align:start position:0%
that I have I believe the state could
have

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh paid for maybe
 
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
nine nine million nine point six million
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
but the point is that would have been
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
very helpful to Claremont and kept our
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
tax rate down
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure some of you here complain
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
and I hear complaints all the time from
 
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
my constituents or on social media about
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
the high property taxes and we as a city
 
00:23:57.409 --> 00:23:57.419 align:start position:0%
and a school district are trying to do
 
00:24:00.649 --> 00:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
our part to keep costs down but we need
 
00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:03.299 align:start position:0%
some help from the state so I urge you
 
00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:06.059 align:start position:0%
that this committee and division two to
 
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
study this bill thoroughly and to give
 
00:24:11.289 --> 00:24:11.299 align:start position:0%
House Bill 330 to a positive
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
recommendation in some form and I would
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
be happy to work with a prime sponsor
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
and division two to help do that if
 
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you for listening
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
I have one yes go ahead we normally had
 
00:24:27.659 --> 00:24:30.049 align:start position:0%
I have one yes go ahead we normally had
a

00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:30.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
a rate based upon the tax base of the
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
towns like my town said 30 percent is
 
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
all they could expect from the this bill
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
puts in 50 for everybody
 
00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:45.059 align:start position:0%
um is that the intent you want to change
 
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
the ratings that we have done in the
 
00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.770 align:start position:0%
the ratings that we have done in the
past

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm as I said I would defer more to
 
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
the the prime sponsor I just want to get
 
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
some help from Claremont if there's some
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
details that need to be fixed or make it
 
00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
more acceptable to everybody else on the
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
committee I understand sometimes some
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
compromises but I'd be open to that but
 
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:03.620 align:start position:0%
I just
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
uh I think 50 is fine but if you want to
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
go to some other percentage I'm willing
 
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
to consider it well historically there
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
have been other percentages okay so I
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
just right now and you make a valid
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
point but I don't I don't know I'm not
 
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh I'm willing to consider other you
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
know some changes but I I understand
 
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
your point of view as well Mr chairman
 
00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
okay I guess division two can bring it
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
up representative Hull for a question
 
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
good morning can you hear me good
 
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
morning yes go ahead please represent us
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
so I I just want to understand the
 
00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:39.539 align:start position:0%
rationale for retro looking back
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
retroactively versus going forward right
 
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
you you did bring it up
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
um decisions were made by the town of
 
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.570 align:start position:0%
um decisions were made by the town of
Claremont

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
Claremont
 
00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
um if I understand it correctly
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide enrollment is dropping across
 
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
the the state I'm not sure about
 
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
Claremont in particular but why
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
retroactively looking back to to fund
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
projects that are already complete
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
versus prioritizing new projects where
 
00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
there might be expanding numbers of
 
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
students in a school system
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
up good point representative and I
 
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
normally am not a fan of retroactivity
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
but understanding the circumstances when
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
we approve that bond in 2007 we had
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
expected some help from the state and
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
and I know a few months later we in the
 
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
legislature had to cut that and I was
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
par part of that legislature so even
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
though I I vote against the budget I
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
still am responsible because I was there
 
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
and I just think we need to make it up a
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
little bit to my community and Newmark
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
and other communities who weren't able
 
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
to get that State Building Aid during a
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
very difficult economic time so it's
 
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
more a moral case uh and as a result it
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
downshifted it was another example of
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
downshifting and we became the the
 
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
community had the dubious dissection and
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
maybe it's no longer true but if having
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
the highest property tax rate in the
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
state we still have a high property tax
 
00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:03.539 align:start position:0%
rate and I hear as I said complaints
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
about constantly from my constituents
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:13.250 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
papavichi Miller
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
just a quick question and if you don't
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
have the answer on the spot I would
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate a follow-up
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
um what is the you know expected life of
 
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
the you know School versus the duration
 
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
of the bonds that were taken to pay for
 
00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
the construction project
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
and again I know you may not know I I'm
 
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
not sure I know it's it's it's a much
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
more beautiful building than it was and
 
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:42.059 align:start position:0%
I went there so uh and it's a one of our
 
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
great Assets Now I don't know maybe 50
 
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
years at least uh but that's just a
 
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
guess uh I think someone else may would
 
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:51.419 align:start position:0%
but at least 50 years and I think that
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
would hopefully last that long because
 
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
the previous it really we we it probably
 
00:27:59.330 --> 00:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
was a had been 50 years before we had
 
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
done it you know it was 50 years earlier
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
we had done in fact 60 years I think the
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
1960s we did put an addition on that
 
00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:09.260 align:start position:0%
building I think goes back to the the
 
00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:12.299 align:start position:0%
1870s and we I remember in addition was
 
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
put on the early 60s just before I
 
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
started high school but I don't remember
 
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.710 align:start position:0%
started high school but I don't remember
anything

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah well I'll you know Majors you
 
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
know since until that renovation
 
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
occurred uh after the vote was occurred
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
in 2011. thank you everybody follow-up
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you and the duration of
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
the bonds how long will the bonds last
 
00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:34.700 align:start position:0%
for the town
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming at least 20 years 30 years
 
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
I don't have the exact details but
 
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
normally from my experience in bonding
 
00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:48.539 align:start position:0%
you go at least 20 years if not 29 30 30
 
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
years something like that thank you okay

00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
basically an Appropriations bill I mean
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
it appropriates a hundred million
 
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
dollars into building Aid in the year of
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
right now as most of you know we've been
 
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
appropriating about 50 million
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
but what happens is over half of that or
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
close close to over half of that is used
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
to pay debt service so actual
 
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
construction and renovation projects for
 
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
our communities is really only 25
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
million to uh per per year or 50 million
 
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
over the bienniums so this just raises
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
that for the for two years
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
and um I do believe that there is a
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
surplus I think this would be a very
 
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
very good way for us to help our
 
00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.070 align:start position:0%
very good way for us to help our
communities

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
with one-time money
 
00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
it after the this biennium it would
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
revert back to the 50 million per per
 
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.669 align:start position:0%
revert back to the 50 million per per
year

00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
it's really a pretty simple it's really
 
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
pretty simple it just raises the amount
 
00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
of building Aid that we share with our
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
communities and I think all of us are
 
00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
from communities that either have had to
 
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
face construction or renovation or will
 
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:46.140 align:start position:0%
in the future but most a lot of our
 
00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
school buildings in New Hampshire are
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
needing needing updating or needing to
 
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
be completely
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
renovated and new construction put in
 
00:33:59.399 --> 00:34:00.169 align:start position:0%
renovated and new construction put in
place

00:34:00.169 --> 00:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
so that's my testimony
 
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:10.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question which communities or
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
how would it be determine be determined
 
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
which communities would receive these
 
00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.990 align:start position:0%
which communities would receive these
funds

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:23.339 align:start position:0%
using the process that the Department of
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
Education already has in place
 
00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
this would just allow more communities
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
to be eligible I think as you heard 17
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
communities applied and only three
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
received funding this year this would
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
just allow this would just allow us to
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
continue with the process that we have
 
00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:45.899 align:start position:0%
in place and actually I think the
 
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
materials that the Department of
 
00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
Education has provided us on building
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
Aid are excellent and I I learned a lot
 
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
reading through them and also hearing
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
hearing the department talk about them
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
so they have a very a very good process
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
in place it's just they don't have
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:13.329 --> 00:35:13.339 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative emmerich
 
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
the appropriation is for 100 million
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
and but over here we've got to spend at
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
least 50 million
 
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
is that I'm understanding with what this
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
is uh yes so if you go to the first
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
um so if you look there right now in law
 
00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
the way the words read are not to exceed
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
50 million the new words would be it
 
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
would be not less than 50 million
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
but in this biennium we would
 
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate 100 million in each year
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you Mr chair
 
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.730 align:start position:0%
um thank you
um

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative walner for taking my
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
question I had to stop myself from
 
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
calling you by your first name
 
00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:17.339 align:start position:0%
um did you in the presentation by the
 
00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
department and I looked at the materials
 
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
I didn't see it is there an amount that
 
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
tells us exactly what is owed on the
 
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.170 align:start position:0%
tells us exactly what is owed on the
tail

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
tail
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
um I think there's a chart well I I've
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
been looking at this chart and now you
 
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
all have it so this this chart you might
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:36:38.569 --> 00:36:38.579 align:start position:0%
you might have to do some addition
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
um yourself but this chart which you now
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
have is really very informative about
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
how much building Aid Debt Service we
 
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
have still to pay off and it's really
 
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
limiting the amount of money that we're
 
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
allowed and able to send back to our
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
communities and isn't that the idea
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
isn't that really what it is about to
 
00:37:05.569 --> 00:37:05.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.329 --> 00:37:08.339 align:start position:0%
follow up a follow-up um
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
as part of this
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
proposal would you consider
 
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.569 align:start position:0%
proposal would you consider
um

00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:14.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
in your allocations creating amount and
 
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
amount of funding that could pay off the
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
bond that we owe all together so we no
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
well I have heard people talking about
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
that idea I think it's really an
 
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
interesting idea and certainly would
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
um help us
 
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
not have this situation that we have
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
where we out we're out we are allocating
 
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars but that 50 million
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
dollars only half of it or less gets
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
back to our communities
 
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't think that people
 
00:37:56.569 --> 00:37:56.579 align:start position:0%
are really aware of that how much this
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
debt service is costing us so
 
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I think it's an interesting idea and
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
certainly I think something division two
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
well I'm sure
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
um entertain and talk about
 
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.339 align:start position:0%
represent hole thank you Mr chair
 
00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
um the one see thing I don't see on this
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
chart is what the interest rate is or
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
the effective interest rate for those
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
bonds is there a way to find that out
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the Department of Education
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
could give you that information I think
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
there is somebody in the room right now
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
from the Department I don't off the top
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:41.579 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
chair I I had to step out and so
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
is is your proposal representative
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
walner that we pay these bonds off
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
faster than the decline or or is this
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
new money to pay off the bonds faster
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
uh well that that is
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
that is a suggestion that I have heard
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
out there that's not what this bill does
 
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
okay this bill appropriates
 
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:12.740 align:start position:0%
additional funds each year for two years
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
but would still pay down
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
the bond rate the bonds
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
there is a proposal out there I've heard
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
people talking about it I haven't seen a
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
bill that people are talking about let's
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
take this one-time money that we have
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
there's these one-time funds we have and
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
pay down pay Down The Debt Service just
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
pay it off
 
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
and then that will allow us to have more
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
money available for Grants to our
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
schools follow-up oh I I think you and I
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
might have been in the same meeting uh
 
00:39:50.569 --> 00:39:50.579 align:start position:0%
do you recall the conversation I I had
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
asked the question about if there was
 
00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
any penalty to repay these bonds before
 
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
they were due and I could have sworn I
 
00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.810 align:start position:0%
they were due and I could have sworn I
heard

00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
us being told that we really could not
 
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
because the bonding pay these particular
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
bonds off faster than scheduled I I just
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
I don't remember what the department
 
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
said at that at that meeting but I think
 
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
like I said they are in the room we
 
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
could ask that question again you know
 
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
if it's a different way to look at it
 
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
any further questions from Committee
 
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:28.320 align:start position:0%

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
Kathleen Murphy is recognized to testify
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
there you go I've got it now I'll start
 
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
again thank you for the opportunity this
 
00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
morning for us to offer our support for
 
00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
House Bill 541 I'm Kathleen Murphy I'm
 
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
the superintendent of schools for the
 
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
Concord school district and joining me
 
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
this morning is Jack Dunn and Jack is
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
our business administrator for the
 
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
Concord School District
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
I would like to take a little bit of a
 
00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
different turn on my presentation this
 
00:41:23.329 --> 00:41:23.339 align:start position:0%
morning the reason for that I could
 
00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
probably sit here for hours and talk
 
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
about the needs in our school buildings
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
and the repairs and the updates and the
 
00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
the need for new construction but I'd
 
00:41:34.609 --> 00:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
like to ask the you to be thoughtful
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
about some comments that I have to make
 
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
that I think are relevant to the work
 
00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:40.859 align:start position:0%
that you do every day it's very clear
 
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
research is very clear about the
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
criteria for which businesses and
 
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
families move to a community
 
00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
there are two major items for that and
 
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
that's housing in schools so schools are
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
really important to communities when
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
businesses establish themselves for
 
00:41:59.569 --> 00:41:59.579 align:start position:0%
instance in the city of Concord as well
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
as when we have new families arrive in
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
our community our schools are important
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
an example of this happens in Concord we
 
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
see at the hospital we see new doctors
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
new staff coming to the hospital and one
 
00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:14.579 align:start position:0%
of the things that they always ask us is
 
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
can we have a tour of the city can we
 
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
see the schools and there's a reason for
 
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
that they want to know if the school is
 
00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:23.660 align:start position:0%
making an investment in their Community
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
do they feel strongly enough to make the
 
00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:29.579 align:start position:0%
effort that the state as well as the
 
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
community because it's a partnership I
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
know you all know that that in funding
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
our school construction and by by
 
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
visiting our schools touring our
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
buildings they are able to see that
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
commitment and I think that's an
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
important consideration for you as you
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
address House Bill 541 which would
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
increase building Aid
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
another example that we see in the
 
00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339 align:start position:0%
district I often get calls from families
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
and they they're new to the district
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
they're moving from wherever as you know
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
we're pretty mobile Society now and in
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
Concord particularly we're really
 
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
fortunate because we have folks from all
 
00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:13.079 align:start position:0%
over the world uh who join us and they
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
always ask to visit the schools why do
 
00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:17.339 align:start position:0%
they do that they want to know where
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
their children are going to be every day
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
they want to know what kind of building
 
00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
it is is it safe does it have the
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
accommodations does it meet the needs of
 
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
our new Learners and so we take
 
00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
particular time to be to give tours and
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
to explain the facilities and the
 
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
availability of those facilities and by
 
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
the way don't forget our facilities
 
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
extend beyond the school day we're not a
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
seven to three operation anymore we are
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
a building that our buildings in Concord
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
in particular and other school districts
 
00:43:50.569 --> 00:43:50.579 align:start position:0%
that I've worked in they're Community
 
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
buildings we don't own them they're the
 
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
they're the they're the buildings of the
 
00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
people and and and in thinking about
 
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
that uh our our buildings are used for
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
multiple reasons for girls and boys club
 
00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:05.819 align:start position:0%
activities the why
 
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
um we have uh Girl Scouts and boy scouts
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh and needless to say all the
 
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
recreation opportunities uh that the
 
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
youngsters have they use our school
 
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.230 align:start position:0%
youngsters have they use our school
buildings

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.490 align:start position:0%
 
recently

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
um the department of Ed was trying to
 
00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
deal with a teacher shortage
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
um and we're all faced with trying to
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
attract the best teachers that we can
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
for our kids every single day
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
and I I want you to know that facilities
 
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
is a factor in that Recruitment and when
 
00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
we're marketing our schools I want to
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that every classroom is
 
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
staffed with the best teacher I can find
 
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that I use is
 
00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
touring the facility so when somebody
 
00:44:53.569 --> 00:44:53.579 align:start position:0%
has an interview they don't just come in
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
and we ask them a lot of questions and
 
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
they leave we give them tours of the
 
00:44:59.210 --> 00:44:59.220 align:start position:0%
building and that's a significant impact
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
on people who want to work in our
 
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
buildings they want to see what the
 
00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
facilities are they want to know if the
 
00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:08.300 align:start position:0%
if if the facility meets a current
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
accommodations for all of our Learners
 
00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:14.420 align:start position:0%
and remember our Learners are very
 
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
eclectic now we have English language
 
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
Learners we have Learners that have
 
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
learning challenges
 
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
um and and and our typical youngsters as
 
00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:27.020 align:start position:0%
well as lots of Hands-On learning
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
project-based learning outdoor education
 
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
so people coming in I especially our new
 
00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:35.339 align:start position:0%
hires are looking for those kinds of
 
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
resources and so for me it's really
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
important to have that as part of our
 
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.970 align:start position:0%
important to have that as part of our
package

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:45.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
one of the things to that it struck me
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
when I was thinking about what I was
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
going to say to you today is when we
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
bring new businesses and we bring new
 
00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
families into the community that that's
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
a revenue for everyone that's a revenue
 
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
for the state because now all of a
 
00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
sudden we see increases in real estate
 
00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
taxes we see increases in simple things
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
like room and meal because we have more
 
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
families more businesses participating
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
in our community and I think that's a
 
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
plus so for school building Aid it isn't
 
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
just about building a building and
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
accommodating in our case we have a need
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
for our Middle School we have 851
 
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
students attending that school and about
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
a hundred plus staff that are in that
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
building every day and so we want to
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have a building that
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
appeals to folks but in doing so that
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
the families coming in offer something
 
00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
to the community as well as the state
 
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
through increase cases in revenues
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
one of the other things that's happened
 
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
with buildings this is particularly true
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
of a lot of communities in our state and
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
having been in education for quite a
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
while I've had an opportunity to see
 
00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
that and
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
um in Concord for instance when when
 
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
they built three new elementary school
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
buildings they took buildings Offline
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
that means those buildings were no
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
longer going to be used as an
 
00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
educational facility but that didn't end
 
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
there in Concord now the businesses
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
bought that building and now those
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
businesses are paying taxes and in the
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
community so that happened with several
 
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
of the buildings that conquered took
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
offline in addition some of the
 
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
buildings are used for the community
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
right now we have the boys and girls
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
club using a facility Head Start is
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
using one of our older buildings we have
 
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:42.740 align:start position:0%
our Concord Community Center a vibrant
 
00:47:46.609 --> 00:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
place for families to go to on a daily
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
basis and in the evening those that
 
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:50.579 align:start position:0%
building is used and it was a former
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
School building so it isn't like we take
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
these things offline and in many cases
 
00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
they bring Revenue to the state and I
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
think that's an important
 
00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:02.339 align:start position:0%
aspect of what we're asking for today as
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
we increase building Aid
 
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
I'll be sure I promise I think I said
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
five minutes
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
you know what happens when you get a
 
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
school teacher up in a microphone
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that I've I've
 
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
really experienced over my career is the
 
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
trades I I finished a project in Hampton
 
00:48:25.609 --> 00:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
I think representative from Hampton will
 
00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
attest to that and it was it was awesome
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
we brought in the Building Trades the
 
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
the plumbers the electricians HVAC all
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
of the folks most of the people that
 
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
were contracted in that project were
 
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire they were New
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire companies
 
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:45.980 align:start position:0%
and what better way to in increase
 
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:49.140 align:start position:0%
opportunities for our businesses than to
 
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
have construction and and and and make
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
sure that people have jobs uh good
 
00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
paying jobs and I I think that's an
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
um increasing building a and I'll I'll
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
try to summarize here but increasing
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
building Aid to public schools has an
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
impact as I as I outlined on so many
 
00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
fronts and I and I I think we've talked
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
about jobs we've talked about the
 
00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
opportunities for additional Revenue
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
we've talked about attracting new
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
businesses and families uh to our
 
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.730 align:start position:0%
businesses and families uh to our
schools

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
our Middle School in Concord is in very
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
poor condition
 
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
I have to tell you that we were number
 
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
four on the list and as you know only
 
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
the top three were given the funding so
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
we were incredibly disappointed to be
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
number four but it's kind of puzzling
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
for me to to realize that only three
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
School in our entire state were eligible
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
for building Aid especially given the
 
00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
years of moratorium
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
but I have to tell you that it does not
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
meet the standards of an appropriate
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
middle school for our 851 plus over a
 
00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
hundred staff each day who attend and so
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
I urge you in closing to support 541 and
 
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
increase building Aid to our Public
 
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
Schools thank you
 
00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you superintendent do you have
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
some written testimony you could share
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
with the clerk I can share this with you
 
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.750 align:start position:0%
with the clerk I can share this with you
yes

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
um do you have any may I uh yield to my
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
good business administrator yes please
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
spell out your whole name so we can have
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
it in the record my name is Jack Dunn j
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
a c k
 
00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:26.099 align:start position:0%
d u n n
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
business administrator for the Concord
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
school district for the last 10 years
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
um I think we support uh representative
 
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
wallner's Bill 541 but I think there are
 
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
some creative ways you could utilize
 
00:50:41.089 --> 00:50:41.099 align:start position:0%
those funds to be able to fund all 17
 
00:50:41.099 --> 00:50:43.370 align:start position:0%
those funds to be able to fund all 17
projects

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
um I think the the state has gone from
 
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
one extreme to the other by allowing
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
multiple building Aid projects to happen
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
and paying for 20 to 30 years over it to
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
now trying to fund 50-year buildings as
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh papavinci Miller
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
had mentioned what's the life of a
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
building that's typically what the
 
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
Architects tell us 50 years but funding
 
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
a 50-year building over two years so
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
there may be a way to utilize funding in
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
this bill to amortize that maybe over
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
five years and be able to take care of
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
17 projects and get rid of a large
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
backlog of projects and satisfy a lot of
 
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
your constituents just a suggestion and
 
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
I'll be proposing to our school board a
 
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
solution to do that if the state can
 
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:35.819 align:start position:0%
I think if your testimony questions from
 
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Sweeney
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you both
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
for being here my question if we were to
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate the additional increase as
 
00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:46.740 align:start position:0%
law outlined in this bill and some of
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
that were to go to the city of Concord
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
School District would the school
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
district commit to lowering School
 
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
District property taxes by an equal
 
00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:55.549 align:start position:0%
District property taxes by an equal
amount

00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:58.140 align:start position:0%
of the offset
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
and there's I'm going to answer it in
 
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
two ways
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
one the Concord School District already
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
does that by lowering property taxes
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
because what it does is it equally it
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
equally impounds dollars from every
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
taxpayer whether they moved in and moved
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
out because
 
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
we earmark five percent of our general
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
fund budget for Debt Service so when our
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
debt service is above five percent we
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
pull from a stabilization fund when
 
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
we're below we add into the
 
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
stabilization fund I wish every school
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
district would do it but trying to
 
00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
convince taxpayers to vote to do that is
 
00:52:32.089 --> 00:52:32.099 align:start position:0%
very hard
 
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
this will allow us to do that
 
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
I can build our school with no tax
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
impact with this funding
 
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
and I could show others out of that way
 
00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:43.730 align:start position:0%
and I could show others out of that way
follow-up

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that would the
 
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
school district commit to lowering
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
property taxes by the equal amount that
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
the aid would be increased in this bill
 
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
we'd have to look at the numbers okay
 
00:52:57.049 --> 00:52:57.059 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:00.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chair
 
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question have
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%

00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
autonomous and the board makes that
 
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
decision and the board has voted uh
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
sold and gave away multiple buildings
 
00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
first Walker School which was now been
 
00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
immediate was not on the tax rolls now
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
on the property tax rolls the old
 
00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
Rumford school off Thorndike off tax
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
rolls now on to the tax rolls sold to a
 
00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:56.099 align:start position:0%
private investor who made it a community
 
00:53:59.089 --> 00:53:59.099 align:start position:0%
school the old Dame school which is up
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
off of Canterbury was given to the city
 
00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
for one dollar even though there are two
 
00:54:05.329 --> 00:54:05.339 align:start position:0%
separate school districts in the city
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
and they turned that into a community
 
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
center for the city of Concord and the
 
00:54:13.849 --> 00:54:13.859 align:start position:0%
Eastman School which is up on charmot is
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
being rented the boys and girls club and
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
Head Start
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
when you sell a building yeah what do
 
00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
you do with that money that money goes
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
into our stabilization fund to offset
 
00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:27.740 align:start position:0%
any impact from school building or
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
projects capital projects so it could be
 
00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
used to improve another building or to
 
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
build another building and we've done it
 
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative papovichi Mueller thank
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking the
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
questions just have a question in terms
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
of looking at the long-term picture with
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
the state school building Aid is it
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
meant to bring money into Concord from
 
00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
other communities in the state or just
 
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
to help you flatten the fluctuations in
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
the property a tax rate due to the
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
impact of the bonds used to pay for
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
school construction obviously you
 
00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
already described that you have the
 
00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
stabilization fund but that may not
 
00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
catch everything so I'm trying to
 
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
understand your intent when looking for
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
a school aid in those terms it's both
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you both for your
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you thank you we have a
 
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
few minutes left is there someone here
 
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education that
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
Here Comes Caitlin and she will tell me
 
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
Rector Caitlin Davis good morning that
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
is correct Caitlin Davis for the
 
00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
and we do want to just let the committee
 
00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:50.809 align:start position:0%
and we do want to just let the committee
know

00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:52.140 align:start position:0%
um I do want to just let the committee
 
00:55:53.569 --> 00:55:53.579 align:start position:0%
know that the department of education
 
00:55:55.809 --> 00:55:55.819 align:start position:0%
does plan to do a presentation tomorrow
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
relative to division two specifically on
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of these topics we do have a
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
handout in front of you that has some of
 
00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
this information but we will be here
 
00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
tomorrow Amy Clark who is our engineer
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
who oversees a school facility program
 
00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:10.700 align:start position:0%
will be here too to talk about
 
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
many of these topics in much more depth
 
00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:15.380 align:start position:0%
than I am capable of
 
00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:17.339 align:start position:0%
providing you
 
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
a few questions though that I have heard
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
that I can answer is that how much is
 
00:56:26.329 --> 00:56:26.339 align:start position:0%
remaining on the existing bonds across
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
the state for the tail
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
um so it's 136 million dollars that 136
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars right now does include
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 which I believe is about
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
25 million so whatever 111 million
 
00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
essentially for 24 and each year
 
00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:42.790 align:start position:0%
essentially for 24 and each year
thereafter

00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
thereafter
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
we cannot pay off the existing bonds the
 
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has had
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
conversations with the New Hampshire
 
00:56:53.809 --> 00:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
Bond Bank relative to the existing bonds
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
but I do want to clarify I know there
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
was a question about the interest rate
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
on a v Bond it is a series of bonds that
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
local municipalities have taken out over
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
a period of time to pay for building
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
projects and the Department of Education
 
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
under the old building aid program used
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
to give Community communities a
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of the Total Bond over the
 
00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
course of 20 years we don't do that
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
anymore the program has changed where we
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
pay a portion up front and then nothing
 
00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
over the life of the bond but so all of
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
those existing bonds and the existing
 
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
tail are local community bonds which
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
might have varying interest rates in
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
varying different time periods of payoff
 
00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.589 align:start position:0%
varying different time periods of payoff
so

00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:38.569 --> 00:57:38.579 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you brought that point up I
 
00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
think people don't understand the
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
complications it could be dozens of
 
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
separate bonds that are being paid off
 
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
that's why the tail is slowly
 
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
diminishing we might pay off one or four
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
bonds one year and have a bunch left the
 
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
next year so it's very complicated that
 
00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
is completely correct glad you brought
 
00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:58.370 align:start position:0%
is completely correct glad you brought
that

00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:00.059 align:start position:0%
questions for the committee for the
 
00:58:00.059 --> 00:58:02.870 align:start position:0%
questions for the committee for the
director

00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you Mr
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Miss Davis good to
 
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
see you again in terms of Eligibility to
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
apply for school building Aid I happen
 
00:58:13.609 --> 00:58:13.619 align:start position:0%
to know that public charter schools are
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
not invited to apply for such Aid
 
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
because I have a bill that will include
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
them that will be heard this year at
 
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
some point are there any other Public
 
00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
Schools excluded from applying for
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
school building Aid not that I'm aware
 
00:58:27.359 --> 00:58:33.010 align:start position:0%
school building Aid not that I'm aware
of

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
all right representative Edwards uh to
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Mooney's
 
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
question I I've I've been told that
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
public academies such as Pinkerton uh
 
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
are excluded from applying from school
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
aid and and so if you could just double
 
00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire for a question
 
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:58:59.569 --> 00:58:59.579 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's been 10 years
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
since I was a member of division two so
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
I don't remember these answers I'm sure
 
00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
I knew it at one time can you we've
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
heard that there are 17 that that
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
applied and three that have received a
 
00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:12.049 align:start position:0%
applied and three that have received a
funding

00:59:12.049 --> 00:59:12.059 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
what how does that work is it just first
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
come first serve does a certain ways
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
certain ones get to the top of the list
 
00:59:20.569 --> 00:59:20.579 align:start position:0%
and so on and since you were on division
 
00:59:20.579 --> 00:59:21.410 align:start position:0%
and so on and since you were on division
two

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
's actually
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
so even if you could remember it it
 
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
would be irrelevant so
 
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
um so the program now works is every
 
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:32.220 align:start position:0%
other year the Department of Education
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
accepts applications from school
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
districts relative to school building
 
00:59:38.569 --> 00:59:38.579 align:start position:0%
Aid school districts have to submit a
 
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
letter of intent to the Department of
 
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
Education on January 1st of every year
 
00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
and a completed application by July 1st
 
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
of the of the same year the Department
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
of Education then uses a set of ranking
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
rules or sorry a scoring criteria that
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
is in rules to rank the projects based
 
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
on the the information provided in the
 
01:00:03.289 --> 01:00:03.299 align:start position:0%
application there's also site visits
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
that are required as part of the process
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
and there's a team of individuals at the
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education including two
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
Engineers that have done this work
 
01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education then takes
 
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
its ranked list and presents it to the
 
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
school building authority and the school
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
building authority then takes the
 
01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
Department's rank list and gives it to
 
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education the State
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
Board of Education approves the final
 
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
list and publishes the list by January
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
of the following year
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education then will
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
present that list as part of its budget
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
so right now we have that list that was
 
01:00:41.329 --> 01:00:41.339 align:start position:0%
approved in the month of November by the
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education they met their
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
deadlines and we will be presenting that
 
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
as part of our project budget to show
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
you those schools that potentially could
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
receive funding
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
so I do want to clarify a point from the
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
committee when we're talking about three
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
schools have received funding to date no
 
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
schools have received funding the
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has a list of 17
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
applications that we've received as of
 
01:01:07.569 --> 01:01:07.579 align:start position:0%
July 1st completed applications I should
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
clarify that we have ranked that and we
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
look at then the list and we say these
 
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
are who are who is going to receive
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
money and I believe that is in your
 
01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:21.299 align:start position:0%
packet and how much funding that they
 
01:01:23.089 --> 01:01:23.099 align:start position:0%
are eligible for and how much money the
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
project is in total then the department
 
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
will wait to see how much money is
 
01:01:30.289 --> 01:01:30.299 align:start position:0%
appropriated in our budget in each B1
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
and potentially hb2 there was some
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
funding provided in hb2 last year and we
 
01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:37.559 align:start position:0%
will go down the ranked list and let
 
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
schools know that we have funding that's
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
available to them the school has then a
 
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
time period to pass a bond locally and
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
if they do pass the bond locally then
 
01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
they will receive funding if they are
 
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
unable to pass a bond we then will fund
 
01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
the next project down on the list so
 
01:01:56.809 --> 01:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
right now the department is estimating
 
01:01:59.030 --> 01:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
that with the amount of money that we
 
01:02:01.089 --> 01:02:01.099 align:start position:0%
will have available to us
 
01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
assuming that we first pay the existing
 
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
tail of about 25 million dollars and
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
then any additional Debt Service the
 
01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
state has on existing bonds that we will
 
01:02:15.049 --> 01:02:15.059 align:start position:0%
have essentially another 30 or 40
 
01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
million dollars available to us over the
 
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
course of the biennium the then we will
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
then go and offer to schools so we
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
believe right now and that's with the
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
existing law with the cap of 50 million
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
dollars so then we assume that we will
 
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
have enough funding likely if if the
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
legislature were to fund that full 50
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars at least the first three
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
projects on the list the fourth list on
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
the list is Concord
 
01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
um and Concord would receive if we were
 
01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:43.740 align:start position:0%
to receive if we received they would
 
01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
receive some funding but we would not
 
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
have any funding to rest to provide
 
01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
funding for their full project amount
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
meaning the others on the community
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
would maybe not receive funding around
 
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
the list would not receive funding now
 
01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
of course if the first four on the list
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
for example don't pass their bonds then
 
01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
we might fund four through eight or
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
whatever the order of of them passing
 
01:03:08.049 --> 01:03:08.059 align:start position:0%
their bonds are
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so
 
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:11.950 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so
um

01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
assuming that it goes the way you
 
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
described that the first three get
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
funded and Conquer gets partially funded
 
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
um the next year does Concord become
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
number one or new ones come in and the
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
Concord would have to reapply and all
 
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
the other 13 would would have to reapply
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
how does that work that is a good
 
01:03:35.569 --> 01:03:35.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:36.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
I hope there's no further well J.R Hull
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
we're coming up on 11 o'clock and I
 
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
don't want to keep representative lad
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
waiting because I know he's got 100
 
01:03:46.849 --> 01:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
bills to go work on representative Hull
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
for a question sure thank you two quick
 
01:03:51.049 --> 01:03:51.059 align:start position:0%
questions one
 
01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
is there a reason and maybe historically
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
there is that they fund fully the first
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
the top applicants and don't distribute
 
01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
it amongst the balance of the applicants
 
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
that is the way the program is designed
 
01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:05.450 align:start position:0%
that is the way the program is designed
okay

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:07.609 --> 01:04:07.619 align:start position:0%
and then follow up
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
follow up um
 
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
when this bill was presented it was
 
01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:17.339 align:start position:0%
talking about 100 million dollars worth
 
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
of excess that was available now going
 
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:22.140 align:start position:0%
in the bill looks like it is going to
 
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.870 align:start position:0%
in the bill looks like it is going to
appropriate

01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
um almost two hundred thousand dollars
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
between the two years separately is that
 
01:04:28.079 --> 01:04:29.030 align:start position:0%
between the two years separately is that
correct

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions from the
 
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none we will close this
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%

and we will open the hearing on House
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%

is here to present and
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
after closing 541 I will read the list

as always happy to have you yeah uh I
 
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
have passed out a pack of the materials
 
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
uh I hope everybody has one in front of
 
01:05:51.289 --> 01:05:51.299 align:start position:0%
you because I'm going to just take you

01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
okay it looks like everybody has a copy
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
now there are a few extras here
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
um just to make sure you got the the
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
same materials I have in front of you
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
the first page is a page that I put
 
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
together the second page is from the
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
Bureau of school safety and Facilities
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
from Amy Clark and it shows you the
 
01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
history of where we've been with school
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
building Aid including the dates in
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
which we had the moratorium and
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
subsequently how many how many building
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
applications have been approved since
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
the moratorium
 
01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:38.339 align:start position:0%
um it's interesting to look on that that
 
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
we've had the number of applications
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
funded you can add them up it comes to
 
01:06:45.529 --> 01:06:45.539 align:start position:0%
six since we've had this moratorium six
 
01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
building projects have been approved one
 
01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
of which was an emergency I'll get in
 
01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
that a little later the second sheet is
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
based upon our formula shows you the
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
percentage that we as a state are
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
obligated to help if one of these
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
districts receives
 
01:07:03.529 --> 01:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
School building Aid it's interesting
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
note it's anywhere from 30 percent to 60
 
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
percent and this is one area in our law
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
where we really do have fiscal capacity
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
our fiscal Aid disparity Aid due to the
 
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
poverty level in in a community it's
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.329 --> 01:07:26.339 align:start position:0%
let's see the next sheet down
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
or you skip a page because it's just a
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
second half alphabetical order the next
 
01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
one shows you where we are with Our
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
obligation on our debt here and you can
 
01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:37.220 align:start position:0%
see that by the year
 
01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
2041 we're we're done with it
 
01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
however we have an obligated debt that
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
we're paying off as we go through in the
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
previous last several years including
 
01:07:50.329 --> 01:07:50.339 align:start position:0%
this year I'll get into specifics but if
 
01:07:53.089 --> 01:07:53.099 align:start position:0%
we allocate over the biennium of 100
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the biennium both
 
01:07:57.289 --> 01:07:57.299 align:start position:0%
years 50 million of that goes off to pay
 
01:07:59.210 --> 01:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
debt so we're trying to take the
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
remaining 50 million dollars and use
 
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
that for new construction or renovation
 
01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
projects that have been accepted and
 
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
gone through the process and the process
 
01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
is very extensive process which starts
 
01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
with the Department organizing and
 
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
rating and and putting them in some kind
 
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
of a a sequential schedule as far from
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
highest to the least and then it goes on
 
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
the school building authority then the
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
state board for approval the last sheets
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
and please excuse my handwriting on on
 
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
the side on it what I was looking at is
 
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
equalized property valuation rates
 
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
etc for each of these communities we
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
have 17 projects to put in for this
 
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
biennium that we're looking at of which
 
01:08:43.729 --> 01:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
we I heard you talking when I came in
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
the room that there's a potential we
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
might be able to fund three of those of
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
the 17.
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
so let's go back to the front sheet here
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
and and look at what I put on there a
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
little chart there what my bill does
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
right here is we're trying to put
 
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
guarantee that we will have 50 million
 
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
dollars for
 
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
construction new construction and
 
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
renovation on top of what we have to pay
 
01:09:13.610 --> 01:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
off as our debt and that little chart
 
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
there that table kind of shows you what
 
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
the debt would be for FYE 27 18.2
 
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
million dollars and so we'd have to
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
allocate a total in a budget of 68.2 if
 
01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
we're going to have the 50 million
 
01:09:27.169 --> 01:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
dollars on top
 
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
why we need this renovation a new
 
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
construction projects back when we
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
developed the various schedules for I'll
 
01:09:40.249 --> 01:09:40.259 align:start position:0%
go back to about 2009 89 on the delivery
 
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
of an opportunity for an adequate
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
education we did not include school
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
facilities as part of the leg of what an
 
01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
opportunity of edge opportunity for an
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
adequate education is seeing that we had
 
01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
another funding formula in place to
 
01:09:58.850 --> 01:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
provide for building construction
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
so you won't see building Aid as a part
 
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
of our adequacy formula itself but it is
 
01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
very closely tied to academic
 
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
achievement very closely tied to
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
academic achievement we have renovation
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
new projects a need for it because of
 
01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
unsafe conditions compliance with idea
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
overcrowding and associative influences
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
on our curriculum and instruction yes we
 
01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
have some districts are declining in our
 
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
demographics we know that our population
 
01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
when I started out here in the house and
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
represent why are you way before me here
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
I was on City Council in Homer Alaska
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
when you were sitting here doing your
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
thing here but
 
01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
when I came in on 2008 and up to this
 
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
point in time the population of our
 
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
state was around 210 plus thousand kids
 
01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:49.970 align:start position:0%
state was around 210 plus thousand kids
Statewide

01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
now we're down to 160 some people 161
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
164 000. we have lost a significant
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
number of students however that's not
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
true to every every situation in this
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
state there are places where they're
 
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
maintaining there's also some school
 
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
districts which are growing in
 
01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:12.050 align:start position:0%
districts which are growing in
demographics

01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
demographics
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
so that's something we have to look at
 
01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of overcrowding and Associated
 
01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
influences on our instructional spaces
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh and when we talk about that we're
 
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
talking about conferencing we're talking
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
about classroom spaces we're talking
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
special education we're talking about
 
01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
library media center Jim uh cafeteria
 
01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
all that
 
01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
um I mentioned a bit about this is the
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
only area in law which we really do
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
provide fiscal capacity based upon
 
01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
measurable criteria the percentage of
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
kids eligible for free and reduced we're
 
01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
looking at poverty
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh we we also need to have projects
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
going forward to remedy remediate or
 
01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
remedy imminent danger and we have some
 
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
situations one of those six projects
 
01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
which we've approved recently was a
 
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
result of that was one in my home
 
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
community of Haverhill where we had our
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
school population as they spoke
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler earlier this
 
01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:09.179 align:start position:0%
morning in the hall downstairs we had
 
01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
kids for special education were in an
 
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
old house beside the school district and
 
01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
the top floor was condemned by the fire
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
marshal as having mold and not meeting
 
01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
fire code conditions we also had another
 
01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
building where we had housed part of our
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
vocational then but it was also part of
 
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
our Sciences program we had asbestos in
 
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
the ceiling and hanging out we had one
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
bathroom in this facility which is many
 
01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
times the size of this one bathroom in
 
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
that facility that was only for it was
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
in the staff member's office
 
01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
so what we did with that Grant we
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
brought all this back in and of course
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
and their representative Hill is the
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
chair of the of the uh School building
 
01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.669 align:start position:0%
chair of the of the uh School building
uh

01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
whatever your committee's called right
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
that but uh he they came up and saw this
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
we did have issues so now we've tied it
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
all together through that Grant so we
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
have education going on one place where
 
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
special ed kids don't have to rock
 
01:13:12.169 --> 01:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
across a parking lot to mainstream and
 
01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
get involved with other aspects of our
 
01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
programming and much more in terms of
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
security we did not have good Security
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
in that whole complex
 
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we look at why we
 
01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
need it because there are projects that
 
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
will contribute to the operational costs
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
efficiencies we can bring kids from
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
three buildings into two buildings and
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
saving labor costs we can save on
 
01:13:38.689 --> 01:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
operational costs uh costs of fuel Etc
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
by moving them into one over a period of
 
01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
time and that's something we need to be
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
looking at seeing that many of these
 
01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
older facilities which we have if you go
 
01:13:51.169 --> 01:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
down to the bottom here just below the
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
chart you'll see 50 percent of school
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
buildings in New Hampshire are over 60
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
years old
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
they have the old heating systems that
 
01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
are just could you could uh with tubes
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
in it you could probably heat the Queen
 
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
Mary on it you have ventilation systems
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
in classrooms that bang and Clank an
 
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
Elementary's classroom teachers are
 
01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
putting the mittens and the hats and the
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
gloves of wet wet gloves to come in from
 
01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
the recess yard and they're stinking the
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
rooms up and we have to keep changing
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
filters within those old machines it's
 
01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
not the type of air quality control we
 
01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
would like to have seeing that our
 
01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
science and our medical people say this
 
01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
is not right we need to cure and fix
 
01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
some of that
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
six percent of these buildings were
 
01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
built prior to Nineteen Hundred
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about well over 123
 
01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
years old some of these buildings
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
seven schools are over 69 years old and
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
not had a major renovation in the last
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
196 schools 60 percent of our schools
 
01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:54.500 align:start position:0%
originally built prior to 50 years ago
 
01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
backloaded building Aid projects an FY
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
10 if not y19 there's a backlog and as a
 
01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
result of this moratorium we had one
 
01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
other school that we just recently gave
 
01:15:07.729 --> 01:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
a grant to up in rumney New Hampshire
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
they could not get a parent who's in a
 
01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
wheelchair into the building because the
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
building was up four steps
 
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
we couldn't put any of the in the second
 
01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
floor we couldn't put handicapped
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
students in the second floor
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
there is no elevator there's no way up
 
01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
to it so the space in that building was
 
01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
very limited
 
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
and and and created a lot of
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
difficulties for that particular
 
01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
Community since then they have an
 
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
excellent principle up there in John
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
anston fantastic job and we have had a
 
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
project paid by us in the state we
 
01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
contributed to it and it's it's helped
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
that schools tremendously
 
01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:48.179 align:start position:0%
how does the education facility uh
 
01:15:51.649 --> 01:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
impact learning I believe it really is a
 
01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
part of adequacy if you don't have this
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
chemistry Labs if you don't have the
 
01:15:58.729 --> 01:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
sciences that are necessary you're not
 
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
going to be able to to compete against
 
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
the schools that have all this in place
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
we need to really think about where
 
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
we're going with school building Aid and
 
01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
the 50 million dollars we've been
 
01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
providing which includes our debt has
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
just not been cutting it uh the
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
difference in achievement scores
 
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
in a student that's in a old building
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
versus one that's new and shiny and has
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
all the wells and whistles bells and
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
whistles 17 top points difference that
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
can be as high as that normally it's a
 
01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
little less than that but it can be
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
between five and ten percentile points
 
01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
but achievement is different
 
01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
as we go around I know some may question
 
01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
that but this is this is a fact there's
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
lots of research behind that
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
we have new needs in our schools nursing
 
01:16:53.689 --> 01:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
programs are growing by by Leaps and
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
Bounds we have some folks that have
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
nurses hidden away underneath the stairs
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
we have nurses stations that don't have
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
bathrooms and we have nurses rooms that
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
don't have showers in it we have kids
 
01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:06.659 align:start position:0%
that are now living in vehicles
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
we need to do something about providing
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
those Services the adequacy of space is
 
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
necessary to do this and and these
 
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
districts which have the need for fiscal
 
01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
capacity it cannot do it they they're
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
taxed to the hilt already they need to
 
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
have the state getting into this with
 
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
their 60 percent you notice that the
 
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
schools that have improved that
 
01:17:30.169 --> 01:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
tentatively are on the list the three
 
01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:32.300 align:start position:0%
schools Rochester
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
Colebrook Monadnock where the looking
 
01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
elementary schools
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
sixty percent sixty percent fifty five
 
01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
percent these are schools really need
 
01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
that the next one down is a Concord
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
which also needs it but they're at a 30
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
level I believe
 
01:17:50.209 --> 01:17:50.219 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at Colebrook you're
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
looking at a school right now that's
 
01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
shipping their CTE students across the
 
01:17:57.649 --> 01:17:57.659 align:start position:0%
river to Canaan Vermont that program has
 
01:17:59.709 --> 01:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
not been improved they're recognizing it
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
Colebrook had to close the old Academy
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
building scene that was just not fit for
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
what we're using now they have their
 
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
high school kids in that middle school a
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
school that's designed for elementary
 
01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:13.970 align:start position:0%
school that's designed for elementary
education

01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
they are on the list to receive funds to
 
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
renovate that building and make it
 
01:18:21.169 --> 01:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
appropriate we have other situations
 
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
just like this in this state but Amy
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
Clark is having to go through carefully
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
and try to prioritize these rank order
 
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
them there's folks on this rank order
 
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
and yes the question was asked if
 
01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
they're on this list right now are they
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
automatically going to be in the list in
 
01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
future years no they're not
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
we might have something come in that has
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
a higher rank in terms of safety Health
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
Etc Fire Marshal stuff that has to go on
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
top so I'll conclude my presentation I'm
 
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
sorry to take so much time up but here's
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
a quote on the bottom of this sheet
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
the success of our whole system
 
01:19:02.689 --> 01:19:02.699 align:start position:0%
depends as much on a thorough reform in
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
the construction and care of
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
schoolhouses as upon any other single
 
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
circumstance whatever
 
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
that was presented to this house this
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
body in 1847 by the commissioner of
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
common schools
 
01:19:21.169 --> 01:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
folks things haven't changed
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot to improve and yes we
 
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
have a lot of things happening in our
 
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
state where some schools have space to
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
utilize but we have other situations
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
that are just old just because we have
 
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
space doesn't mean that building is
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
usable so thank you very much for your
 
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
time and I take any questions you may
 
01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:39.410 align:start position:0%
time and I take any questions you may
have

01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ladd questions
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative papovichi Miller thank
 
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you Mr lad for
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
taking the question yes just a really
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
quick question I was looking at the uh
 
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
other change in the bill that you are
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
proposing that the building age shall be
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing and continually appropriated
 
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
it does look to me that removing the
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
ability to elapse funds uh if they are
 
01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
not needed in a future budget May
 
01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
encourage you know may limit the
 
01:20:08.209 --> 01:20:08.219 align:start position:0%
flexibility of future legislatures and
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
potentially encourage spending beyond
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
what is needed could you explain the
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
intent behind that language we have some
 
01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
other funds which are non-lapsing funds
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
as well I also chair the commission for
 
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure that's a
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
commission that we're looking at I I see
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
represent Heath she's on that committee
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
commission and we we have been looking
 
01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:32.219 align:start position:0%
at Access Communications uh security and
 
01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
all different dimensions for these
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
schools in the state in which we've
 
01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
allocated out over the last several
 
01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:38.689 align:start position:0%
allocated out over the last several
years

01:20:38.689 --> 01:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
um the first go around it was 28.5
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars now we've re and we had
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
a uh access money or left over money on
 
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
that we didn't use that came back from
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
some of these grants which we had
 
01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
um uh given to school districts but they
 
01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
got the cost to come in less so there's
 
01:20:58.970 --> 01:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
a 1.3 million dollars left over we took
 
01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
the other two point million dollars
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
which was allocated for the
 
01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
infrastructure funds last year
 
01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
school buses I don't know if you
 
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
remember that in hb2 and we combined at
 
01:21:10.729 --> 01:21:10.739 align:start position:0%
3.3 and now we've used that this year
 
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
for security in our schools as well it's
 
01:21:15.649 --> 01:21:15.659 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing money it goes back into the
 
01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
in the till for that purpose
 
01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't think
 
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
personally there won't be a whole lot of
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing money in this account seeing
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
it's all going to be used if you're the
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
last school and there's money left over
 
01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
it goes the next one on the list they
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
have to make the decision there where
 
01:21:32.689 --> 01:21:32.699 align:start position:0%
they're going to take half the money or
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to wait and throw the dice
 
01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
to see if they can get a full funding in
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
a later year uh so I I'm going to leave
 
01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
how finances are handled to this group
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
right here I'm coming forward and as
 
01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:48.179 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler and I've talked
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
often I'll do the policy stuff I'll
 
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
inform you that we're in a world of hurt
 
01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
in terms of of school buildings I'm
 
01:21:57.649 --> 01:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
asking the finance committee here to
 
01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
address that and recognize that and help
 
01:22:01.729 --> 01:22:01.739 align:start position:0%
us in this fix
 
01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
um so I as I'm listening to this I've
 
01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
been thinking about
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
um how the state funding may be viewed
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
by the local community in the Auburn
 
01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
Village School we went ahead and decided
 
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
that our renovation was so important we
 
01:22:33.530 --> 01:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
did it anyways uh anticipating no State
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
support to speak of and and so it makes
 
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
me wonder when you say that there's a
 
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
rule of the dice uh on whether they
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
might take half the money in the hopes
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
that they could get all of it the next
 
01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
year isn't there a logical argument for
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
taking the adequacy formula because you
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is kind of part of
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
adequacy taking that adequacy formula
 
01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
and putting some amount of money in
 
01:23:05.209 --> 01:23:05.219 align:start position:0%
building aid for all the schools so that
 
01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
we're empowering the local communities
 
01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
so they know what kind of building Aid
 
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
support they can anticipate and then
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
instead of gaming the state budget they
 
01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
you're on course and and what we're
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
looking at there's another bill which we
 
01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
have in education which is looking at
 
01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:32.900 align:start position:0%
from A to Z the whole application
 
01:23:36.649 --> 01:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
process the timeline for this is awful
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
right now if we have to have these
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
applications in by July 1 and then by
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
January 15th after going through all the
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
Hoops of the school building authority
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
the doe the school building authority
 
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education they have
 
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
to come out and say Mr District you are
 
01:23:55.729 --> 01:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
being awarded a grant on January 15th
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
that gives us less than six months to go
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
through and scrutinize all these
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
applications for Amy put everything in a
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
rank order to get out on site and see
 
01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
what we've got out there to better
 
01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
understand and the letter of intent and
 
01:24:11.450 --> 01:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
going back with the whole process with
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
your schematic design which is part of
 
01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
the cost of the school district we'll
 
01:24:18.649 --> 01:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
have to start at least 18 months earlier
 
01:24:21.169 --> 01:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
now in your in looking at where the
 
01:24:22.729 --> 01:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
money for these projects comes from
 
01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
that's a good question does it come out
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
of the education trust fund do we do
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
something set it up like that there's
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
been discussion of that I know even
 
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
within doe
 
01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
um I think where you are is there there
 
01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
has to be a source for this it's one
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
thing we've got to understand this is
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
not part of adequacy this is not part of
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
acquis I say it should be but it's not
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's you know we have
 
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
instruction we have curriculum we have
 
01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
assessment the fourth leg I think is
 
01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
really do you have a building
 
01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a building you might
 
01:24:59.209 --> 01:24:59.219 align:start position:0%
be able to do it online but that's not
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
eyeballed eyeball instruction and you
 
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
don't have the labs the facilities Etc
 
01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:04.610 align:start position:0%
don't have the labs the facilities Etc
so

01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
um I think that where the money comes
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
from is something that Finance needs to
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
look at I don't and ways and means I
 
01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
don't have a handle on all that
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
follow up okay so based on your last
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
comment I don't think we should
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
anticipate next year or this year seeing
 
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
a a proposed Bill to shift building Aid
 
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
into part of the adequacy formula
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
instead of this method correct but we
 
01:25:41.810 --> 01:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
agree I think that this method creates a
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
lot of wasted motion of having
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
localities come to the state only to be
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
turned away because there's no room in
 
01:25:53.689 --> 01:25:53.699 align:start position:0%
our end wouldn't so so wouldn't it so
 
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
just to make sure I understand your
 
01:25:56.810 --> 01:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
testimony you think it might be
 
01:25:59.450 --> 01:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
preferable to put the school building
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
Aid as part of an adequacy formula so
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
that we get the state less involved in
 
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
local building decisions
 
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
I I
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
don't know quite how to answer that when
 
01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
when we were pretty much funding every
 
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
project came down the road when I came
 
01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
in here we had 540 million dollars of
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
debt that we have obligated ourselves we
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
are borrowing from our Visa card using
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
our MasterCard it was that type of a
 
01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:29.629 align:start position:0%
our MasterCard it was that type of a
game

01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
game
 
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
we were so far underneath we went
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
through this moratorium
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
um to say now that we're going to lock
 
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
some of this inadequacy I think the
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
source has to be established but we also
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
have to recognize we have buildings out
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
there that need help and and and how we
 
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:49.139 align:start position:0%
do that where the source comes from I
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
don't have uh I mean we had a study a
 
01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
commission looking at funding I didn't
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of that was the 16-1 vote
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
I was the opposite side but we were all
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
together in terms of where we were with
 
01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:03.060 align:start position:0%
school building Aid
 
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
um I I think because when we initially
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
got there it was separate from adequacy
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
I think what's wise to stay separate of
 
01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
adequacy but for us also to recognize
 
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
that we do have something in it as a
 
01:27:18.649 --> 01:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
state the town local has
 
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
a commitment they have to have some
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
ownership in this project too no
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
ownership there's not going to be what
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
we want as far as understanding where
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
those dollars are coming from and care
 
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
of the facility's maintenance of the
 
01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:32.270 align:start position:0%
of the facility's maintenance of the
facilities

01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to be done on this
 
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and um
 
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
we've kicked the can down long enough on
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
this we need some money out there to
 
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
help these schools now now I understand
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to change
 
01:27:45.169 --> 01:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
things for the two years you're talking
 
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
about in the budget right now but we
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
need to get this squared away for the
 
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
following biennium
 
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
but thank you Mr chair
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
representative emmerich for a question
 
01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:27:58.669 --> 01:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
well representative Ladd
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
will you win here in the testimony by
 
01:28:02.090 --> 01:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
the business manager from the Concord
 
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
school system was here
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
oh you were I don't think I was here for
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
that one okay well he made a comment
 
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
that said we ought to think about how we
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
support the communities because he said
 
01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
our formula seemed that we take a
 
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
50-year school and pay our portion in
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
two years
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
and so I think what he was referencing
 
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
kind of backhandedly was maybe we ought
 
01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
to look at how we do this instead of
 
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
tinkering with it we ought to say here's
 
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
a better way to do it where we basically
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
partner with the community and fund over
 
01:28:39.169 --> 01:28:39.179 align:start position:0%
20 years our portion as as they are
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
paying theirs over 20 years or something
 
01:28:43.729 --> 01:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
like that I'm not I'm not trying to get
 
01:28:46.129 --> 01:28:46.139 align:start position:0%
a conclusion but is it better to have a
 
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
strategic discussion on this rather than
 
01:28:50.689 --> 01:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
all the tinkering around trying to fix
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
what doesn't seem to be working this
 
01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
discussion needs to be strategic in
 
01:28:56.209 --> 01:28:56.219 align:start position:0%
nature when we initially had the old
 
01:28:56.219 --> 01:28:58.310 align:start position:0%
nature when we initially had the old
formula

01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
formula
 
01:29:01.010 --> 01:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
we did not provide the school district
 
01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
the community the 80 percent up front
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
and upon completion the 20 of our
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
portion the state aid the 30 to 60
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
percent that saved on a lot of interest
 
01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:14.219 align:start position:0%
uh on the principle that the district
 
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
was you know having to take out when we
 
01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
funded it over a period of 20 years
 
01:29:22.729 --> 01:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
so that that is one small component that
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
we have to be looking at in in a
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
strategic plan where how are we going to
 
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
do this and and we need to have
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
involvement from both the local and the
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
the the state however I want to remind
 
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
all again that there are some districts
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
that just don't have the capacity
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
the fiscal capacity deal when you look
 
01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:45.500 align:start position:0%
at their economic status and situation
 
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
to provide what we are putting out that
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
you will be teaching this this and this
 
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
and and yet it's almost it comes down to
 
01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
it's almost like an unfunded mandate
 
01:29:58.250 --> 01:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
we're we're telling to do this but we're
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
not going to provide you the facility to
 
01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
do it in
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:09.649 --> 01:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
he just asked a question to me
 
01:30:11.689 --> 01:30:11.699 align:start position:0%
I I have a question
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
do you know on the criteria for how they
 
01:30:18.129 --> 01:30:18.139 align:start position:0%
put people in the queue to get the money
 
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
do they use the fact that they may be
 
01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
growing in population do they use the
 
01:30:26.209 --> 01:30:26.219 align:start position:0%
fact that they may not have spent any
 
01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
money on maintenance let the building
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
deteriorate and then come to us crying
 
01:30:31.810 --> 01:30:31.820 align:start position:0%
you need to give me a new building
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
everybody should be maintaining that is
 
01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
criteria and for example we had some
 
01:30:39.229 --> 01:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
buildings for example there was a
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
building even in my town
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
where the middle school was built in the
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
early 1990s
 
01:30:49.370 --> 01:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
they had a two stories here and they
 
01:30:52.129 --> 01:30:52.139 align:start position:0%
were venting out of the art room up the
 
01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:54.900 align:start position:0%
Kiln up the side of the wall into the
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
attic and about one point 15 years later
 
01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
the roof is gone
 
01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
and you know why all that moisture was
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
up there and it was eating out there was
 
01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
no maintenance being done we now since
 
01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
have if any kind of a building project
 
01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
the clerk of wore of the works of that
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
particular project by state mandate now
 
01:31:17.629 --> 01:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
is has to be a qualified engineer and
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
bonded or like an engineer an architect
 
01:31:23.629 --> 01:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
it can't be your head custodian who is
 
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
good at the job but not a engineer and
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
is guessing what's behind that wall
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's asbestos behind the wall or
 
01:31:31.330 --> 01:31:31.340 align:start position:0%
just air
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
so there there's a lot to this
 
01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:36.950 align:start position:0%
so there there's a lot to this
um

01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
the we do have a requirement that if
 
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
they bail out of this building from
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
using state aid in 20 years they've got
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
to pay it back to us that's in state law
 
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
uh there's a number of things which we
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
have upgraded to our statutory language
 
01:31:53.450 --> 01:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh since we initially made these changes
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
and we made these changes working with
 
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine they had a pro
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
program my old athletic director back in
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
Maine was the commissioner of Education
 
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
Duke Albanese and was there when they
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
put in the building aid program there we
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
echoed a lot of that so we improved it
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
but we're not we're not where we need to
 
01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
anything further from the committee
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
represent whole
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm looking at the
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
notes that you turned in right going
 
01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
down by facilities the list of
 
01:32:31.010 --> 01:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
applications in particular I'm looking
 
01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:31.850 align:start position:0%
applications in particular I'm looking
at

01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:32:33.649 --> 01:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
four which is conquered in five which is
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
Litchfield both of which are building
 
01:32:37.310 --> 01:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
new middle schools
 
01:32:38.689 --> 01:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
Concord is building a new middle school
 
01:32:40.209 --> 01:32:40.219 align:start position:0%
for approximately 900 people
 
01:32:42.050 --> 01:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
litchfield's building a school for
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
approximately 400 based on the current
 
01:32:43.679 --> 01:32:45.110 align:start position:0%
approximately 400 based on the current
enrollment

01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:48.780 align:start position:0%
the disparity between 176 million and 32
 
01:32:51.410 --> 01:32:51.420 align:start position:0%
million is huge is there any explanation
 
01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
how we allow for such disparity between
 
01:32:57.649 --> 01:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
the amount spent per student and
 
01:33:04.129 --> 01:33:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
you can see on the right hand side there
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
I I put some numbers down there for you
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh I did this back a while myself for
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
example if you're looking at concrete
 
01:33:16.970 --> 01:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
you see 25.12 that's their Equis
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
assessed value based on the assessed
 
01:33:23.570 --> 01:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
properties the 22.72 is their equalized
 
01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil uh our our equalized
 
01:33:30.169 --> 01:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
valuation excuse me and and so you see
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
those differences
 
01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:36.110 align:start position:0%
those differences
um

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:40.370 --> 01:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
you have go ahead if you follow I guess
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
my question is not per student
 
01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
necessarily but the cost for the
 
01:33:46.129 --> 01:33:46.139 align:start position:0%
structure is the difference is huge we
 
01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
have a student a school proposed by
 
01:33:50.090 --> 01:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
Litchfield that's going to house 400
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
students based on their current
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment and they're asking for a 32
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
million dollar project and we have a
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
student sorry Concord is asking for a
 
01:33:59.689 --> 01:33:59.699 align:start position:0%
school roughly twice that size and
 
01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
they're asking for 176 million dollar
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
project and that just both for middle
 
01:34:06.169 --> 01:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
school and that just that seems a five
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
to one ratio seems out of whack for yeah
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
represent whole I remember you on our
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
education committee years ago
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
um the that I think that's a question
 
01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
that's best asked for Amy Clark
 
01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is not here this week and
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
she could be here answering that
 
01:34:23.450 --> 01:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
particular question right now and I
 
01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
think that if you have a work session on
 
01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
this one in division two it might be I'd
 
01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
grab Amy and bring her in
 
01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
she is an engineer and she's been
 
01:34:34.610 --> 01:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
working on this and she's been to all
 
01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:36.380 align:start position:0%
these schools
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we didn't pass the Bill
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
last year where we had 3.3 million
 
01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
dollars and we were going to go around
 
01:34:44.649 --> 01:34:44.659 align:start position:0%
and visit all the schools in this state
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
with engineers and architect and an
 
01:34:50.209 --> 01:34:50.219 align:start position:0%
education policy so when we had our
 
01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
report we knew what we were dealing with
 
01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
out there in the schools right now
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
what's what we're basing a lot of what
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
we have to do it's based upon what the
 
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
district's providing us we have not gone
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
and done the evaluation use the same
 
01:35:07.729 --> 01:35:07.739 align:start position:0%
criteria for every school so there's a
 
01:35:09.649 --> 01:35:09.659 align:start position:0%
lot we have to do in terms of cleaning
 
01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:14.219 align:start position:0%
up our our whole policy on this so I I
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
look to you to help us do that
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any further
 
01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
from the committee members
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler and committee
 
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
and we'll next call on representative
 
01:35:36.169 --> 01:35:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
you didn't you didn't include my
 
01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:39.729 align:start position:0%
you didn't you didn't include my
position

01:35:39.729 --> 01:35:39.739 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
a member of the finance committee no no
 
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
that's not share of division no no my
 
01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
position on these bills
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much Mr chairman the
 
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan McGuire and I represent
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
Epsom I'm opposed to these bills and I
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk in the public hearing
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
because everyone we've heard so far is
 
01:36:03.530 --> 01:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
in favor
 
01:36:06.169 --> 01:36:06.179 align:start position:0%
of school building Aid and I think
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
school building Aid is a poor public
 
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
policy for reasons somewhat that
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards was was touching
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
on in his comments but but in general
 
01:36:20.450 --> 01:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
any kind of policy that moves public
 
01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
funds from one group of taxpayers to
 
01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:25.310 align:start position:0%
funds from one group of taxpayers to
another

01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
hasn't really accomplished anything
 
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
right for the for the taxpayers maybe
 
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
maybe the handful of school districts
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
that are getting funds are a little bit
 
01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:37.860 align:start position:0%
happier but the other taxpayers where
 
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
the funds are coming from are a little
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
bit unhappier to maybe to the same
 
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.129 align:start position:0%
bit unhappier to maybe to the same
extent

01:36:43.129 --> 01:36:43.139 align:start position:0%
extent
 
01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
the problem is that school building Aid
 
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
um encourages higher taxes not lower all
 
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
right so as as we all remember from
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
Governor Thompson low taxes are the
 
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
result of low spending the problem is
 
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
school building Aid encourages higher
 
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
spending why because on the district
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's getting aided we're we're saying
 
01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
to them if you get Aid you can have a 30
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
million dollar school but it'll only
 
01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
cost you 20 million dollars
 
01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
so the people voting for that school
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
think to themselves well is it worth it
 
01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
to me to get a 30 million dollar school
 
01:37:33.110 --> 01:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
when I only cost me 20. as opposed to
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
um is it if I want a 30 million dollar
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
school and it cost me 30 million dollars
 
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
the making that that decision
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
um correctly right the the but but when
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
you say to someone I'll give you a
 
01:37:51.890 --> 01:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
discount on that school the the general
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
result is going to be more school
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
building than would naturally occur
 
01:38:01.129 --> 01:38:01.139 align:start position:0%
right so we're encouraging higher
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
spending here on schools than what
 
01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
otherwise occur
 
01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
and higher spending it results in higher
 
01:38:13.129 --> 01:38:13.139 align:start position:0%
taxes right so so there's must be a
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
better way to help
 
01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers and help school
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
districts and so on then this then this
 
01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
way which which gives us higher spending
 
01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
and I would say the right way to help
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
those districts is what this committee
 
01:38:31.370 --> 01:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
did two years ago when they reduced the
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax by a hundred
 
01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:35.219 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
right because because we had extra money
 
01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
from taxpayers in general and we wanted
 
01:38:44.450 --> 01:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
to have lower property taxes so we
 
01:38:46.209 --> 01:38:46.219 align:start position:0%
lowered property taxes very
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
straightforwardly but in doing so we
 
01:38:52.129 --> 01:38:52.139 align:start position:0%
didn't encourage higher spending we did
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
we didn't throw off the economics of of
 
01:38:59.330 --> 01:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
how government works right so so this in
 
01:39:01.790 --> 01:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
general is not a good policy and it's
 
01:39:03.649 --> 01:39:03.659 align:start position:0%
not something we should be putting more
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
money into
 
01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:39:09.649 --> 01:39:09.659 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGuire any
 
01:39:09.659 --> 01:39:11.709 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGuire any
questions

01:39:11.709 --> 01:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh thank you Mr chair uh thank
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I know you've
 
01:39:17.810 --> 01:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
been looking at this for a very long
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
time I I guess I'm just looking for
 
01:39:23.770 --> 01:39:23.780 align:start position:0%
first principles as a first principle
 
01:39:27.649 --> 01:39:27.659 align:start position:0%
should the state be supporting building
 
01:39:32.110 --> 01:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
Aid or should the communities be
 
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
accumulating the building Aid in their
 
01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
own resources is there a role for the
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
state in Revenue sharing
 
01:39:42.890 --> 01:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question
 
01:39:48.110 --> 01:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
so I would say in general a bad
 
01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
um bad public policy is what is
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
something we do all the time and that is
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
transfer money from one level of
 
01:39:59.330 --> 01:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
government to another where the
 
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
receiving entity is making all the
 
01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
decisions right so similarly
 
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
um I mean this is why the federal
 
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
government is in such trouble right they
 
01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
pay us a half the amount of money we we
 
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
spend on on Medicaid
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
um and and so we make the decisions do
 
01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
we have Medicaid or not based on the
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
fact that it only costs us 50 of what we
 
01:40:26.810 --> 01:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
get to spend well the net result for the
 
01:40:28.729 --> 01:40:28.739 align:start position:0%
taxpayers is we're spending a lot of
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
money uh more than we would do otherwise
 
01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:35.540 align:start position:0%
if Medicaid was entirely our own program
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
so so in general I think that levels of
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
government should tax and spend on their
 
01:40:47.570 --> 01:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
own and not and not transfer money in
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
this way now
 
01:40:52.970 --> 01:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
um you know in some sense we're ordered
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
by the court Etc to to transfer money
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
and I would agree with
 
01:41:01.370 --> 01:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
um with representative Ladd that an
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
expense of schools is is the is the
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
school itself right and so and so if
 
01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
we're if we're doing adequacy the
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why some fraction of
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
that like rent could be part of that
 
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
that equation
 
01:41:21.890 --> 01:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
um but but in general I don't
 
01:41:25.129 --> 01:41:25.139 align:start position:0%
if you if you make as a condition to
 
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
receiving the check that you spend right
 
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
if you spend this I send you the check
 
01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:35.699 align:start position:0%
then that encourages more spending if
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
you say I send you the check based on
 
01:41:40.189 --> 01:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
some other condition whether you spend
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
or not right then you'll spend
 
01:41:42.719 --> 01:41:47.270 align:start position:0%
or not right then you'll spend
adequately

01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.609 --> 01:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
follow up okay so what I think I heard
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
you say is that yes probably the state
 
01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
has some responsibility to assist the
 
01:41:57.410 --> 01:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
local communities with school building
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
Aid or rent as you put it but that the
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
magic is in how we do it so that we
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
reduce the game playing that's taking
 
01:42:09.649 --> 01:42:09.659 align:start position:0%
place in the in the false incentives
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
that may occur as a result but in
 
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
general yes the state does have a
 
01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility all right let me let me
 
01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
try to be more specific so
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
if you buy the argument that
 
01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:21.430 align:start position:0%
if you buy the argument that
um

01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
we're all in this together and somehow
 
01:42:26.450 --> 01:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
wealthier communities and wealthier
 
01:42:29.770 --> 01:42:29.780 align:start position:0%
individuals should help out poorer ones
 
01:42:32.209 --> 01:42:32.219 align:start position:0%
therefore the state has to have a role
 
01:42:32.219 --> 01:42:33.709 align:start position:0%
therefore the state has to have a role
right

01:42:33.709 --> 01:42:33.719 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
if that's what you're asking right so so
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
the state that's where the state role
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
comes from it's it's it's shifting money
 
01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
from from Able able taxpayers to to you
 
01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
know disabled ones or whatever but
 
01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:49.669 align:start position:0%
know disabled ones or whatever but
um

01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it should be a big
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
role and I don't think that
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
um again it should be based on uh if I
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
spend more I get more right like that it
 
01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
should be you exist therefore you get
 
01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:09.890 align:start position:0%
should be you exist therefore you get
something

01:43:09.890 --> 01:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.450 --> 01:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGuire any
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
leishman thanks Mr chairman thanks for
 
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question so where is the proof
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
If we spend more we get more
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for the all right so
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you an example of the town
 
01:43:28.729 --> 01:43:28.739 align:start position:0%
next to mine
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
um they decided to build a 30 million
 
01:43:34.010 --> 01:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
dollar school and they were told you
 
01:43:38.689 --> 01:43:38.699 align:start position:0%
only have to pay 20 right so so and they
 
01:43:40.609 --> 01:43:40.619 align:start position:0%
decided to do it
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
the the point is what if they were told
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
you wanna if you want this 30 million
 
01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
dollar school you have to pay 30. their
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
decision would be different maybe maybe
 
01:43:54.169 --> 01:43:54.179 align:start position:0%
it would maybe it wouldn't right but but
 
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
their decision would be based on their
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
own true economics right I mean if if
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
you're offered
 
01:44:07.129 --> 01:44:07.139 align:start position:0%
a car for for you know two-thirds of the
 
01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
normal price you're more likely to buy
 
01:44:11.689 --> 01:44:11.699 align:start position:0%
it you won't necessarily buy it right
 
01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.930 --> 01:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.570 --> 01:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
we have a final pink sheet from
 
01:44:43.570 --> 01:44:43.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:44:46.199 --> 01:44:47.030 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
committee

01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh I Rise really because of the previous
 
01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
speaker and I I want to tell you that
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
we've done that
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
we've done that we told the communities
 
01:44:57.169 --> 01:44:57.179 align:start position:0%
uh we're not going to pay we won't even
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
accept the applications and yes some of
 
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
them did it because they had to
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
like they were going to lose their
 
01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
accreditation they had fire and safety
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
or they really just saw that they needed
 
01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
and the the share that the building age
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
share runs a bit you know basically from
 
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
30 percent up to as high as 60 percent
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
in some cases where the economic need
 
01:45:21.250 --> 01:45:21.260 align:start position:0%
justifies it so we're not really
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
incentivizing people to overdo it and it
 
01:45:26.209 --> 01:45:26.219 align:start position:0%
was a very it's very much a struggle
 
01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
even when we had building Aid in New
 
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
Market I believe we ran it uh different
 
01:45:32.530 --> 01:45:32.540 align:start position:0%
approaches by like three or four times
 
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
and each of them failed because it's not
 
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
like people in New Hampshire are trying
 
01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
to spend money uh we we know it's
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
differently in our communities we're
 
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
we're very uh property tax sensitive so
 
01:45:47.149 --> 01:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
to say that you know if you in your the
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
building a program is an incentive to
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
spend more money it's not true
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
it's just false we're trying to do
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
provide an adequate education and an
 
01:45:58.490 --> 01:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
adequate facility and we need the state
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
to act as the partner that it did for
 
01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:01.550 align:start position:0%
to act as the partner that it did for
decades

01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
decades
 
01:46:04.010 --> 01:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
being none thank you for your testimony
 
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%

01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
on school building Aid
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
we will
 
01:46:24.290 --> 01:46:24.300 align:start position:0%

to have another bill another set of
 
01:46:55.729 --> 01:46:55.739 align:start position:0%
Bills starting with House Bill 207 at
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.840 --> 03:02:42.130 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:02:42.130 --> 03:02:42.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:45.950 --> 03:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
have a hearing on House Bill 207
 
03:02:49.849 --> 03:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:52.730 --> 03:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
um at the right bill here
 
03:02:54.070 --> 03:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
relative to school district
 
03:02:56.750 --> 03:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
unanticipated funds
 
03:02:59.750 --> 03:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
and let's see if we have the
 
03:03:01.790 --> 03:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
any of the sponsors here representative
 
03:03:03.889 --> 03:03:03.899 align:start position:0%
Platt is recognized
 
03:03:06.170 --> 03:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you all for
 
03:03:09.290 --> 03:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
hearing uh my testimony I introduced
 
03:03:13.429 --> 03:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
this bill at the request of sau19 Scott
 
03:03:15.230 --> 03:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
grossed the business administrator is
 
03:03:17.090 --> 03:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
behind me and he'll get into the detail
 
03:03:20.150 --> 03:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
as will Laura Taylor Who's the assistant
 
03:03:22.670 --> 03:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
business administrator I did get asked
 
03:03:24.889 --> 03:03:24.899 align:start position:0%
by them to introduce this bill the
 
03:03:28.969 --> 03:03:28.979 align:start position:0%
general concept is uh we to cut costs in
 
03:03:31.550 --> 03:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
in time because twenty thousand dollars
 
03:03:34.429 --> 03:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
the SC the school board has to set up a
 
03:03:38.230 --> 03:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
separate meeting to to accept
 
03:03:41.750 --> 03:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
unanticipated revenues as opposed as
 
03:03:43.309 --> 03:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to doing it in the school board
 
03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
itself which is public but it's just the
 
03:03:48.889 --> 03:03:48.899 align:start position:0%
cost and time of setting that up and so
 
03:03:51.469 --> 03:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
if you raise the threshold from five
 
03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
thousand or Twenty Thousand it will cut
 
03:03:55.070 --> 03:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
the number of times they do that they'll
 
03:03:57.170 --> 03:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
provide all of the detail behind that
 
03:04:00.050 --> 03:04:00.060 align:start position:0%
but that's the general concept
 
03:04:01.670 --> 03:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
and I've got to go back to my own
 
03:04:03.889 --> 03:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
committee so a question or two would be
 
03:04:05.150 --> 03:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
fine but I've got to go back I'm Clark
 
03:04:07.309 --> 03:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
there so they're missing me
 
03:04:08.870 --> 03:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative plant any
 
03:04:10.610 --> 03:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:04:12.290 --> 03:04:12.300 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward Bill thank you
 
03:04:14.150 --> 03:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
03:04:17.090 --> 03:04:17.100 align:start position:0%
and we will next hear from Scott gross
 
03:04:31.070 --> 03:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:38.929 --> 03:04:38.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:42.230 --> 03:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
there we go thank you Mr chairman my
 
03:04:44.330 --> 03:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
voice usually carries pretty well so uh
 
03:04:46.849 --> 03:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
and uh rest of the committee uh again I
 
03:04:48.530 --> 03:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
agree with you I think this is more of a
 
03:04:51.469 --> 03:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
housekeeping type bill it hasn't been
 
03:04:53.630 --> 03:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
um I guess amended in about 17 or 18
 
03:04:56.570 --> 03:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
years and basically
 
03:04:58.070 --> 03:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
um we found ourselves over the last
 
03:05:00.410 --> 03:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
couple of years holding a lot of these
 
03:05:03.050 --> 03:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
public hearings to accept uh donations
 
03:05:06.290 --> 03:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
of funds over uh over five thousand
 
03:05:09.349 --> 03:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
dollars uh and Laura Taylor who is the
 
03:05:10.969 --> 03:05:10.979 align:start position:0%
assistant business administrator said
 
03:05:13.010 --> 03:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
Scott you know you got to do something
 
03:05:15.650 --> 03:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
about about this so I dragged her here
 
03:05:17.510 --> 03:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
today as well
 
03:05:20.690 --> 03:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking the ads uh to put
 
03:05:23.330 --> 03:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
it into a newspaper about a hundred and
 
03:05:25.010 --> 03:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars on average sometimes a
 
03:05:26.830 --> 03:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
little less sometimes a little bit more
 
03:05:29.990 --> 03:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
but it adds just yet another layer of
 
03:05:32.450 --> 03:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
administrative effort that's needed and
 
03:05:34.670 --> 03:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
the cost so um Laura can talk to the
 
03:05:37.429 --> 03:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
cost in a minute uh another issue that
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
has come up like and it's the weather so
 
03:05:43.070 --> 03:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
I'm holding a public hearing uh tomorrow
 
03:05:45.530 --> 03:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to to accept a donation
 
03:05:47.809 --> 03:05:47.819 align:start position:0%
from a PTA in excess of five thousand
 
03:05:48.889 --> 03:05:48.899 align:start position:0%
dollars so we're holding the public
 
03:05:50.809 --> 03:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
hearing well due to the weather tomorrow
 
03:05:52.429 --> 03:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
night we've now canceled that public
 
03:05:54.349 --> 03:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
that that meeting and the public hearing
 
03:05:56.630 --> 03:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
so now we have to have it on Thursday I
 
03:05:58.250 --> 03:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
can't do it because I have to have seven
 
03:06:01.309 --> 03:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
days notice in order to accept those
 
03:06:03.950 --> 03:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
funds so now I have to schedule it for
 
03:06:05.510 --> 03:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
probably another two or three another
 
03:06:08.030 --> 03:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
meeting out so it's those types of
 
03:06:08.040 --> 03:06:08.990 align:start position:0%
meeting out so it's those types of
things

03:06:08.990 --> 03:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:06:11.210 --> 03:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
um again it just needs a little bit of
 
03:06:13.969 --> 03:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
of updating on on those on those funds
 
03:06:16.250 --> 03:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
Laura can speak to uh what we spend
 
03:06:18.769 --> 03:06:18.779 align:start position:0%
typically in a given year in each of our
 
03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
03:06:22.730 --> 03:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
03:06:26.990 --> 03:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:28.429 --> 03:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
03:06:30.650 --> 03:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
I'll ask him you have a white sorry
 
03:06:32.630 --> 03:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
03:06:33.830 --> 03:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:06:35.809 --> 03:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
question so
 
03:06:38.389 --> 03:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
um is this twenty thousand dollars per
 
03:06:41.870 --> 03:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
incident per item yes it would be uh per
 
03:06:43.910 --> 03:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
item and the other thing I I should also
 
03:06:45.889 --> 03:06:45.899 align:start position:0%
mention is that um the level of
 
03:06:48.349 --> 03:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
transparency which I think most most of
 
03:06:50.090 --> 03:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
us pride ourselves in New Hampshire is
 
03:06:52.910 --> 03:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
our level of governmental transparency
 
03:06:55.070 --> 03:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
this still goes on our school board
 
03:06:57.889 --> 03:06:57.899 align:start position:0%
agendas or in the case of a municipality
 
03:07:00.410 --> 03:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
a select board or a Town Council this
 
03:07:02.570 --> 03:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
would still go on their agenda so the
 
03:07:04.910 --> 03:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
public is still duly warned
 
03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
um we put the agendas everyone puts
 
03:07:08.269 --> 03:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
these agendas on the website they're
 
03:07:10.730 --> 03:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
given in advance so there is no lack of
 
03:07:13.969 --> 03:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
transparency it's not like a school
 
03:07:15.889 --> 03:07:15.899 align:start position:0%
district or municipality would be doing
 
03:07:17.690 --> 03:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
anything you know nefarious or anything
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of making a little
 
03:07:21.889 --> 03:07:21.899 align:start position:0%
bit easier to do these jobs and to
 
03:07:24.230 --> 03:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
streamline it follow up
 
03:07:26.030 --> 03:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
um how many did you have in the past
 
03:07:30.830 --> 03:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
year and what was the total amount yeah
 
03:07:37.090 --> 03:07:37.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
in FY 22 Goffstown School District spent
 
03:07:43.550 --> 03:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
um eighteen hundred and thirty five
 
03:07:45.290 --> 03:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
dollars on advertisements for public
 
03:07:45.300 --> 03:07:46.670 align:start position:0%
dollars on advertisements for public
hearings

03:07:46.670 --> 03:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
03:07:49.910 --> 03:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
um we had I would say two or three
 
03:07:51.830 --> 03:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
public hearings that were under the
 
03:07:53.809 --> 03:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollar threshold I don't
 
03:07:55.690 --> 03:07:55.700 align:start position:0%
believe that any members of the public
 
03:07:59.210 --> 03:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
came to those public hearings and all
 
03:08:01.969 --> 03:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
donations were voted in and accepted by
 
03:08:06.050 --> 03:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:08.929 --> 03:08:08.939 align:start position:0%
any follow-up
 
03:08:11.870 --> 03:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
03:08:13.730 --> 03:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:08:15.290 --> 03:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
03:08:15.300 --> 03:08:15.889 align:start position:0%
the questions
um

03:08:15.889 --> 03:08:15.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:17.870 --> 03:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
it has been our practice I was on the
 
03:08:19.670 --> 03:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
school board in Windham in the past and
 
03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a separate meeting for
 
03:08:23.269 --> 03:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
the public hearing we just had it you
 
03:08:25.610 --> 03:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
know a special it we dedicated a part of
 
03:08:27.110 --> 03:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
the school board meeting so those who
 
03:08:29.870 --> 03:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
are not additional costs but do you find
 
03:08:31.910 --> 03:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
the notice requirements which are indeed
 
03:08:33.889 --> 03:08:33.899 align:start position:0%
separate you know such a significant
 
03:08:33.899 --> 03:08:35.809 align:start position:0%
separate you know such a significant
burden

03:08:35.809 --> 03:08:35.819 align:start position:0%
burden
 
03:08:38.450 --> 03:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
so I'm glad that you brought that up um
 
03:08:40.730 --> 03:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
I would say the almost all the time we
 
03:08:42.530 --> 03:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
are holding that public hearing right
 
03:08:44.510 --> 03:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
before our Traditional School board
 
03:08:44.520 --> 03:08:45.769 align:start position:0%
before our Traditional School board
meeting

03:08:45.769 --> 03:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
03:08:48.410 --> 03:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
um the the notice requirements have to
 
03:08:51.410 --> 03:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
be exact so if you mess up in that
 
03:08:53.210 --> 03:08:53.220 align:start position:0%
notice requirement someone could
 
03:08:55.849 --> 03:08:55.859 align:start position:0%
question it so if your date is off or if
 
03:08:58.070 --> 03:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
your time was off you have to then do it
 
03:08:58.080 --> 03:08:58.910 align:start position:0%
your time was off you have to then do it
again

03:08:58.910 --> 03:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:09:00.710 --> 03:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
um so it's not just about putting it in
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
the newspaper you have to proofread the
 
03:09:05.210 --> 03:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
legal notice say from the union leader
 
03:09:07.250 --> 03:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
if there is a typo or something is wrong
 
03:09:09.230 --> 03:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
you could be called into question so
 
03:09:11.809 --> 03:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
it's all those layers so I think you
 
03:09:14.570 --> 03:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
know from my perspective you're just
 
03:09:16.610 --> 03:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
adding more administrative you know
 
03:09:18.830 --> 03:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
burden and again someone had set the
 
03:09:21.290 --> 03:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollar threshold way back
 
03:09:23.570 --> 03:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
um 18 years ago and I just think it's
 
03:09:25.969 --> 03:09:25.979 align:start position:0%
one of these bills that occasionally a
 
03:09:27.349 --> 03:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
bill needs some housekeeping and you
 
03:09:29.389 --> 03:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
need to refresh it based upon current
 
03:09:30.590 --> 03:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
dollars I think this is one of those
 
03:09:33.950 --> 03:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:36.410 --> 03:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips
 
03:09:38.809 --> 03:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
03:09:40.370 --> 03:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question but in the
 
03:09:41.450 --> 03:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
line of the same
 
03:09:43.070 --> 03:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
thought train
 
03:09:44.870 --> 03:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh five thousand dollars was the limit
 
03:09:47.630 --> 03:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
17 years ago just curious are there any
 
03:09:49.250 --> 03:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
mathematicians that have punched you
 
03:09:51.349 --> 03:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
know the numbers in terms of what would
 
03:09:53.450 --> 03:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
that be according you know to inflation
 
03:09:55.969 --> 03:09:55.979 align:start position:0%
numbers today and is that twenty
 
03:09:58.190 --> 03:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar new threshold something
 
03:10:00.050 --> 03:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
that correlates with that inflation
 
03:10:02.210 --> 03:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
change or is this a you know
 
03:10:04.429 --> 03:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
substantially larger threshold
 
03:10:04.439 --> 03:10:05.269 align:start position:0%
substantially larger threshold
um

03:10:05.269 --> 03:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:07.910 --> 03:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know today's money that would
 
03:10:10.849 --> 03:10:10.859 align:start position:0%
suddenly perhaps create a greater need
 
03:10:13.070 --> 03:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
for public notification and
 
03:10:15.170 --> 03:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
participation one that would maybe not
 
03:10:16.610 --> 03:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
have been triggered at the smaller five
 
03:10:19.130 --> 03:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar range
 
03:10:22.910 --> 03:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
I will say that I I did not uh go back
 
03:10:25.309 --> 03:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
18 years ago and and do the compound
 
03:10:28.429 --> 03:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
interest uh equation I I was simply
 
03:10:31.250 --> 03:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
looking at it from the perspective of
 
03:10:34.610 --> 03:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
you know what would be more or less a an
 
03:10:36.530 --> 03:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
amount that would you know offer that
 
03:10:39.410 --> 03:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
level of a higher type threshold
 
03:10:39.420 --> 03:10:40.130 align:start position:0%
level of a higher type threshold
um

03:10:40.130 --> 03:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:42.349 --> 03:10:42.359 align:start position:0%
that number in my opinion is probably 20
 
03:10:43.429 --> 03:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
or 25
 
03:10:46.070 --> 03:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
000 but that's just my my opinion
 
03:10:49.190 --> 03:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
um in looking at just the last year or
 
03:10:50.690 --> 03:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
two with inflation
 
03:10:54.050 --> 03:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
being over eight percent uh I I just
 
03:10:57.110 --> 03:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
think we are seeing so many more of
 
03:11:00.889 --> 03:11:00.899 align:start position:0%
these where local ptas booster clubs you
 
03:11:03.830 --> 03:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
name it want to donate and it just it
 
03:11:09.530 --> 03:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:10.969 --> 03:11:10.979 align:start position:0%
what are the questions representative
 
03:11:13.790 --> 03:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
Heath thank you Mr chair it's good to
 
03:11:15.110 --> 03:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
see you both
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
um in terms of expending those dollars
 
03:11:21.410 --> 03:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
you also need to raise the the your
 
03:11:23.510 --> 03:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
spending Authority so how would that
 
03:11:23.520 --> 03:11:27.290 align:start position:0%
spending Authority so how would that
work

03:11:27.290 --> 03:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
um in in Goffstown and New Boston they
 
03:11:32.809 --> 03:11:32.819 align:start position:0%
have accepted this statute so the
 
03:11:32.819 --> 03:11:34.010 align:start position:0%
have accepted this statute so the
statute

03:11:34.010 --> 03:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:11:35.269 --> 03:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
um was
 
03:11:37.490 --> 03:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
um voted on by the communities of
 
03:11:39.469 --> 03:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
Goffstown and New Boston and and I would
 
03:11:39.479 --> 03:11:40.250 align:start position:0%
Goffstown and New Boston and and I would
say

03:11:40.250 --> 03:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:11:43.309 --> 03:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
a very high percentage of communities in
 
03:11:44.750 --> 03:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire have have
 
03:11:47.210 --> 03:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
been accepted the statute which allows
 
03:11:49.490 --> 03:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
them to accept and expend these types of
 
03:11:52.250 --> 03:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
funds but the requirement is if you read
 
03:11:54.290 --> 03:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
the statute that you have to hold that
 
03:11:56.210 --> 03:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
public hearing as part of that process
 
03:11:59.210 --> 03:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
so not all school districts and
 
03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
communities have accepted it but the
 
03:12:03.230 --> 03:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
vast majority of them have so in that
 
03:12:05.630 --> 03:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
particular case it then increases our
 
03:12:07.610 --> 03:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
spending Authority all right right thank
 
03:12:07.620 --> 03:12:09.469 align:start position:0%
spending Authority all right right thank
you

03:12:09.469 --> 03:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:12:13.010 --> 03:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
03:12:15.769 --> 03:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
Mr you wanted to add something I do
 
03:12:17.570 --> 03:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
thank you as a follow-up to
 
03:12:19.190 --> 03:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips I just
 
03:12:21.110 --> 03:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention that twenty thousand
 
03:12:24.349 --> 03:12:24.359 align:start position:0%
dollar threshold that we are proposing
 
03:12:25.730 --> 03:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
03:12:27.410 --> 03:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
um as the main person that handles our
 
03:12:29.330 --> 03:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
financial audits for Goffstown New
 
03:12:32.750 --> 03:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
Boston and the SAU 19. We Believe twenty
 
03:12:33.889 --> 03:12:33.899 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars has a level of
 
03:12:35.630 --> 03:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
materiality for all school districts in
 
03:12:36.830 --> 03:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:12:37.730 --> 03:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
um twenty thousand dollars for
 
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
Manchester school district is a drop in
 
03:12:41.990 --> 03:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
the bucket but for a smaller District at
 
03:12:45.110 --> 03:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
Hill Berlin it's a more material amount
 
03:12:46.610 --> 03:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
and so we feel like holding a public
 
03:12:49.309 --> 03:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
hearing for that amount better
 
03:12:52.010 --> 03:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
represents all districts in the state
 
03:12:55.910 --> 03:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:57.650 --> 03:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney for a question
 
03:12:59.090 --> 03:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you very
 
03:13:00.469 --> 03:13:00.479 align:start position:0%
much for taking the question just
 
03:13:02.990 --> 03:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
curious if this has made its way and
 
03:13:04.309 --> 03:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
been circulated to other school
 
03:13:06.050 --> 03:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
districts and if you've received any
 
03:13:09.349 --> 03:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
feedback regarding it
 
03:13:11.870 --> 03:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
I cannot speak to other school districts
 
03:13:15.050 --> 03:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
uh both uh Miss Taylor and myself are
 
03:13:18.170 --> 03:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
part of the uh a group called nazbo
 
03:13:19.910 --> 03:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
which is the New Hampshire Association
 
03:13:22.250 --> 03:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
of school business officials we meet on
 
03:13:25.309 --> 03:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis and my peers
 
03:13:28.190 --> 03:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
um all are in support of this it's it's
 
03:13:30.889 --> 03:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
something that is just needed because of
 
03:13:32.929 --> 03:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
this the outdated nature of the of the
 
03:13:35.090 --> 03:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
dollar amount and I think Miss Taylor's
 
03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
point is a really good one in the sense
 
03:13:40.370 --> 03:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
that this is a compromise between larger
 
03:13:42.349 --> 03:13:42.359 align:start position:0%
communities like Manchester Nashua
 
03:13:44.990 --> 03:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth who have you know much much
 
03:13:47.389 --> 03:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
larger budgets than than much smaller
 
03:13:49.190 --> 03:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
communities so this seems to be a happy
 
03:13:51.950 --> 03:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
medium in our opinion not obviously you
 
03:13:54.530 --> 03:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
you are the ultimate Authority on on how
 
03:13:56.990 --> 03:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
this law might progress or the change so
 
03:13:58.429 --> 03:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
we would defer to that but that's the
 
03:14:02.929 --> 03:14:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:04.730 --> 03:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
anything further from the committee
 
03:14:04.740 --> 03:14:05.990 align:start position:0%
anything further from the committee
members

03:14:05.990 --> 03:14:06.000 align:start position:0%

representative Jess Edwards representing
 
03:16:39.110 --> 03:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 31 I'm based in uh
 
03:16:42.290 --> 03:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
in Auburn New Hampshire I'm introducing
 
03:16:46.610 --> 03:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
this bill today because it's a an issue
 
03:16:48.650 --> 03:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
I've tracked for a couple of terms now
 
03:16:48.660 --> 03:16:49.929 align:start position:0%
I've tracked for a couple of terms now
and

03:16:49.929 --> 03:16:49.939 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:54.050 --> 03:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
uh recently has been a few months but it
 
03:16:56.690 --> 03:16:56.700 align:start position:0%
feels recent I had an opportunity to
 
03:16:59.210 --> 03:16:59.220 align:start position:0%
talk to the Auburn Village School
 
03:17:01.690 --> 03:17:01.700 align:start position:0%
principal who's here to testify
 
03:17:05.990 --> 03:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
and she asked me to submit this bill so
 
03:17:08.110 --> 03:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
so here I am
 
03:17:10.550 --> 03:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
what is the history on this bill this
 
03:17:13.730 --> 03:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
bill has been debated in I think two
 
03:17:13.740 --> 03:17:14.830 align:start position:0%
bill has been debated in I think two
terms

03:17:14.830 --> 03:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
terms
 
03:17:19.130 --> 03:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
both times it was passed from a policy
 
03:17:19.140 --> 03:17:22.030 align:start position:0%
both times it was passed from a policy
perspective

03:17:22.030 --> 03:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:27.110 --> 03:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
I tried in both cases to to just let
 
03:17:30.830 --> 03:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
people know that we had a 28a issue
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm here today to really just
 
03:17:36.530 --> 03:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
point out what we already know what our
 
03:17:39.670 --> 03:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation is under 28a
 
03:17:43.730 --> 03:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
28a says if the state mandates it the
 
03:17:45.469 --> 03:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
state shall pay for it
 
03:17:48.650 --> 03:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
the way the original bill
 
03:17:52.010 --> 03:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
two terms ago was written it was written
 
03:17:55.070 --> 03:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
as though to flout the Constitution it
 
03:17:56.990 --> 03:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
was a very short Bill basically two
 
03:17:57.000 --> 03:17:58.190 align:start position:0%
was a very short Bill basically two
sentences

03:17:58.190 --> 03:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
03:18:01.190 --> 03:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
first sentence was essentially there
 
03:18:04.190 --> 03:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
shall be a mandate on schools and in the
 
03:18:06.530 --> 03:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
second sentence a very clear statement
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
that the state shall not pay for it that
 
03:18:13.550 --> 03:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
got negotiated to where the school
 
03:18:16.370 --> 03:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
districts were encouraged to go seek
 
03:18:19.309 --> 03:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
charitable donations and the like but
 
03:18:23.690 --> 03:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
what remained was the state's refusal to
 
03:18:27.650 --> 03:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
sign up to meet its 28a obligation
 
03:18:27.660 --> 03:18:29.150 align:start position:0%
sign up to meet its 28a obligation
so

03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:18:31.610 --> 03:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
um so that's what this is about you may
 
03:18:33.550 --> 03:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
hear testimony
 
03:18:37.969 --> 03:18:37.979 align:start position:0%
about period poverty and how serious an
 
03:18:40.130 --> 03:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
issue this is
 
03:18:41.809 --> 03:18:41.819 align:start position:0%
um and that's not that's not what I'm
 
03:18:43.309 --> 03:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
here to talk about and I hope we don't
 
03:18:45.710 --> 03:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
get distracted by that because that's
 
03:18:47.750 --> 03:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's been the policy decision that's
 
03:18:50.570 --> 03:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh that's already been made I just want
 
03:18:53.570 --> 03:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
to walk you through what this bill does
 
03:18:56.990 --> 03:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
to the existing statute so if you'll
 
03:18:57.000 --> 03:18:57.950 align:start position:0%
to the existing statute so if you'll
flip

03:18:57.950 --> 03:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
flip
 
03:19:01.849 --> 03:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
to the first main page it's all the text
 
03:19:04.610 --> 03:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
of the legislation is just on that one
 
03:19:04.620 --> 03:19:05.769 align:start position:0%
of the legislation is just on that one
page

03:19:05.769 --> 03:19:05.779 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:19:11.510 --> 03:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
on line seven it simply flips the and
 
03:19:13.630 --> 03:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
answers the question who pays
 
03:19:17.030 --> 03:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
because we've said the school districts
 
03:19:19.070 --> 03:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
have to pay but we're mandating it that
 
03:19:22.190 --> 03:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
is the direct violation of 28a so so
 
03:19:26.210 --> 03:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
that gets flipped then line 11 you'll
 
03:19:28.730 --> 03:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
see that there's a a bit of a formula
 
03:19:31.730 --> 03:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
there it says that the schools are
 
03:19:33.769 --> 03:19:33.779 align:start position:0%
eligible for fifteen dollars from the
 
03:19:36.170 --> 03:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for every girl
 
03:19:39.370 --> 03:19:39.380 align:start position:0%
that's uh 12 or older girl or woman
 
03:19:42.889 --> 03:19:42.899 align:start position:0%
now this is not a biology issue this
 
03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
isn't you know should start at 11 and a
 
03:19:48.230 --> 03:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
half or 13 or you know do we need actual
 
03:19:50.870 --> 03:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know evidence this is this is really
 
03:19:54.889 --> 03:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
a simple funding formula which ought to
 
03:19:58.309 --> 03:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
be good enough to keep it lightweight
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
and simple so so it's uh so it says
 
03:20:05.150 --> 03:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars per school year for a
 
03:20:08.150 --> 03:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
person attaining the age of 12 or older
 
03:20:08.160 --> 03:20:09.410 align:start position:0%
person attaining the age of 12 or older
oh

03:20:09.410 --> 03:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:20:11.630 --> 03:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
um line 15.
 
03:20:14.389 --> 03:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
um this is this is kind of new and this
 
03:20:17.330 --> 03:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
tweaks the policy a little bit this this
 
03:20:20.450 --> 03:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
is an effort to uh reduce uh vandalism
 
03:20:22.429 --> 03:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
and petty theft and I think you might
 
03:20:25.309 --> 03:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
hear testimony from the Auburn Village
 
03:20:28.309 --> 03:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
School on on what the impact uh and and
 
03:20:31.010 --> 03:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
cost is associated with that and and
 
03:20:34.550 --> 03:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
this is just basically allowing them to
 
03:20:37.929 --> 03:20:37.939 align:start position:0%
make reasonable efforts to to reduce
 
03:20:41.389 --> 03:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
vandalism and theft
 
03:20:45.110 --> 03:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
line 17 if there's going to be a request
 
03:20:46.790 --> 03:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement there needs to be a
 
03:20:49.250 --> 03:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
new form so it directs that a new form
 
03:20:54.469 --> 03:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
be created line 19 line 19 is something
 
03:20:58.750 --> 03:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
that you know I I think if the committee
 
03:21:02.590 --> 03:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
balked at the at the at the ball price
 
03:21:05.090 --> 03:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
maybe this is where it might be because
 
03:21:07.730 --> 03:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
this is essentially retroactively going
 
03:21:12.050 --> 03:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
back and making the schools whole for
 
03:21:14.150 --> 03:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
the time period in which we had failed
 
03:21:16.630 --> 03:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
to meet our constitutional obligation
 
03:21:21.170 --> 03:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
and that allowing for a back pay it's on
 
03:21:23.630 --> 03:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
a much limited basis instead of the
 
03:21:26.990 --> 03:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars per female it it I think
 
03:21:28.990 --> 03:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
it becomes five dollars
 
03:21:33.110 --> 03:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
so even with that though the difference
 
03:21:35.090 --> 03:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
between the first year and the
 
03:21:37.450 --> 03:21:37.460 align:start position:0%
subsequent years is
 
03:21:41.450 --> 03:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
853k so it's a pretty substantial amount
 
03:21:44.630 --> 03:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
that we saddled the districts in without
 
03:21:47.929 --> 03:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
meeting our prior obligation so so that
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
would be the May Cole clause
 
03:21:55.250 --> 03:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
and then line 24 is an effective date it
 
03:21:57.170 --> 03:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
basically just says that this would go
 
03:21:59.809 --> 03:21:59.819 align:start position:0%
in an effect if signed and it would go
 
03:22:02.809 --> 03:22:02.819 align:start position:0%
into effect for the next school year and
 
03:22:06.769 --> 03:22:06.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:08.870 --> 03:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
03:22:10.070 --> 03:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
03:22:10.080 --> 03:22:11.389 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
McGuire

03:22:11.389 --> 03:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
03:22:12.769 --> 03:22:12.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:22:14.570 --> 03:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:22:14.580 --> 03:22:15.230 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

03:22:15.230 --> 03:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:17.450 --> 03:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
yeah it's that second part that that
 
03:22:21.050 --> 03:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
troubles me that the past is the past
 
03:22:24.230 --> 03:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
and it's hard to fix it you know and are
 
03:22:26.269 --> 03:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
we are we opening a can of worms here
 
03:22:29.210 --> 03:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
for trying to write all the wrongs of
 
03:22:31.690 --> 03:22:31.700 align:start position:0%
all past legislators
 
03:22:31.700 --> 03:22:33.610 align:start position:0%
all past legislators
legislatures

03:22:33.610 --> 03:22:33.620 align:start position:0%
legislatures
 
03:22:36.650 --> 03:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
rather than just doing the right thing
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
for ourselves and going forward
 
03:22:41.510 --> 03:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
but you know I think that's an excellent
 
03:22:43.429 --> 03:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
question and one I've kind of thought a
 
03:22:45.429 --> 03:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
little bit about and I I could see
 
03:22:48.230 --> 03:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
wanting to drive a wedge to to to to
 
03:22:51.650 --> 03:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
make the past the past but I also felt
 
03:22:54.170 --> 03:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
it incumbent upon me to communicate to
 
03:22:58.010 --> 03:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
the committee uh what it has cost the
 
03:23:00.650 --> 03:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
schools for are not doing our duty under
 
03:23:03.130 --> 03:23:03.140 align:start position:0%
our the Constitution and that cost is
 
03:23:05.990 --> 03:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
853k that
 
03:23:08.330 --> 03:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
um if we don't pay them then that's what
 
03:23:11.450 --> 03:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
we're asking them to eat there there's a
 
03:23:14.090 --> 03:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
small precedent on this that I'd share
 
03:23:16.429 --> 03:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
um you know we we spent a lot of time we
 
03:23:17.809 --> 03:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
created that hundred million dollar
 
03:23:20.710 --> 03:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
settlement fund for the sununu center
 
03:23:24.290 --> 03:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
abuse and that's 100 million dollars
 
03:23:27.910 --> 03:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's going back into the 60s so so we do
 
03:23:31.429 --> 03:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
have some precedent that we understand
 
03:23:34.490 --> 03:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
Our obligation to the Past
 
03:23:36.530 --> 03:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
um uh even while we're trying to build
 
03:23:38.690 --> 03:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
this new new center that uh that
 
03:23:40.450 --> 03:23:40.460 align:start position:0%
prevents that sort of use in the future
 
03:23:44.929 --> 03:23:44.939 align:start position:0%
so I I I'm guessing this would go to
 
03:23:48.050 --> 03:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
division two and I'm sure that committee
 
03:23:50.870 --> 03:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
could have that conversation and make a
 
03:23:50.880 --> 03:23:52.790 align:start position:0%
could have that conversation and make a
determination

03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
determination
 
03:23:56.090 --> 03:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah I'm not sure those two
 
03:23:58.910 --> 03:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
examples are comparable that the that
 
03:24:00.349 --> 03:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
somehow that what happened at the
 
03:24:03.229 --> 03:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
susanunu center is the fault of the
 
03:24:03.239 --> 03:24:05.349 align:start position:0%
susanunu center is the fault of the
legislature

03:24:05.349 --> 03:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:24:07.670 --> 03:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
back then
 
03:24:09.769 --> 03:24:09.779 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's the fault of the
 
03:24:12.290 --> 03:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
people who did those abuses in my
 
03:24:14.330 --> 03:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
opinion sure but the state's paying for
 
03:24:16.490 --> 03:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
it is kind of my point is that we are
 
03:24:18.590 --> 03:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
setting up some money to pay for the
 
03:24:21.769 --> 03:24:21.779 align:start position:0%
sins of the past and and uh I think we
 
03:24:23.870 --> 03:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
did something similar and there's a term
 
03:24:27.170 --> 03:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
of art for this but it was the um the
 
03:24:29.389 --> 03:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
money that we appropriated so that the
 
03:24:32.630 --> 03:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
people who had uh received poor
 
03:24:35.510 --> 03:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
financial advice from the state could go
 
03:24:38.030 --> 03:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
and get some small percentage of the
 
03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
money that they were out because of the
 
03:24:45.170 --> 03:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
lack of good information so so
 
03:24:47.330 --> 03:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
so now we're standing your very good
 
03:24:49.790 --> 03:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
point I I just want to say that there's
 
03:24:53.150 --> 03:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
another side of the coin thank you
 
03:24:56.330 --> 03:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:24:58.130 --> 03:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham
 
03:24:59.450 --> 03:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you
 
03:25:01.490 --> 03:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for taking my
 
03:25:01.500 --> 03:25:02.929 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for taking my
question

03:25:02.929 --> 03:25:02.939 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:25:06.050 --> 03:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
um the uh first ques do you think the
 
03:25:08.030 --> 03:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
schools would get sufficient funds to be
 
03:25:10.429 --> 03:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
worth the administrative paperwork I
 
03:25:13.550 --> 03:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
mean we have the smallest SAU smallest
 
03:25:15.889 --> 03:25:15.899 align:start position:0%
SAU in the state would probably be
 
03:25:19.150 --> 03:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
getting less than eight hundred dollars
 
03:25:22.429 --> 03:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
and the second related question is how
 
03:25:24.950 --> 03:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
did you come up with fifteen dollars per
 
03:25:27.729 --> 03:25:27.739 align:start position:0%
school year so we we were already
 
03:25:30.290 --> 03:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
supplying menstrual products all along
 
03:25:33.050 --> 03:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't wasn't any new funding for
 
03:25:36.349 --> 03:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
our particular School okay so I think
 
03:25:37.910 --> 03:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
you I think you actually have three
 
03:25:39.410 --> 03:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
points in there
 
03:25:41.990 --> 03:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
um so to the first point
 
03:25:46.130 --> 03:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
um this chart this asks the doe to adopt
 
03:25:48.830 --> 03:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
rules and set up a funding request form
 
03:25:51.290 --> 03:25:51.300 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know that they have to
 
03:25:53.570 --> 03:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
make that a complicated form it I mean
 
03:25:56.150 --> 03:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
based on the math it's what school is it
 
03:25:59.090 --> 03:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
what was the student population what's
 
03:26:00.769 --> 03:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
the math I mean it could be a very
 
03:26:02.570 --> 03:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
simple form that even I could fill out
 
03:26:05.389 --> 03:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
so so there's that
 
03:26:06.710 --> 03:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
um and then I'm sorry what were the
 
03:26:09.670 --> 03:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:09.680 --> 03:26:11.290 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:26:11.290 --> 03:26:11.300 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:26:14.870 --> 03:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
actually uh I was a weasel and I went to
 
03:26:17.269 --> 03:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
the Auburn Village School principal and
 
03:26:18.769 --> 03:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
said give me a number that would
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
compensate you for your costs so she's
 
03:26:23.150 --> 03:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
going to come up and you could you can
 
03:26:26.030 --> 03:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
ask her about that but I basically uh
 
03:26:28.370 --> 03:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
was a clerk on that uh that funding
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
issue and then you did have a third
 
03:26:32.570 --> 03:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
point that wasn't as obvious in there
 
03:26:34.610 --> 03:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm just missing
 
03:26:36.889 --> 03:26:36.899 align:start position:0%
uh it's just that many schools were
 
03:26:38.750 --> 03:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
already supplying these uh and
 
03:26:41.030 --> 03:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
presumably under your adequacy formula
 
03:26:44.090 --> 03:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
yeah so so that is not in the formula I
 
03:26:46.670 --> 03:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
think that's a fine point because yes in
 
03:26:48.710 --> 03:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
fact schools were predominantly already
 
03:26:51.410 --> 03:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
taken care of this what what what
 
03:26:55.790 --> 03:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
happens though is that we triggered uh
 
03:26:59.450 --> 03:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
28 a being considered when we made it a
 
03:26:59.460 --> 03:27:00.349 align:start position:0%
28 a being considered when we made it a
mandate

03:27:00.349 --> 03:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
03:27:04.429 --> 03:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
you know and so so to the extent that we
 
03:27:07.510 --> 03:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
set up a system in which they uh
 
03:27:07.520 --> 03:27:09.130 align:start position:0%
set up a system in which they uh
incurred

03:27:09.130 --> 03:27:09.140 align:start position:0%
incurred
 
03:27:12.349 --> 03:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
additional costs because they were able
 
03:27:15.110 --> 03:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
to manage waste and manage theft and the
 
03:27:17.809 --> 03:27:17.819 align:start position:0%
like and then all of a sudden the
 
03:27:20.030 --> 03:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
perception at least is that the rules
 
03:27:22.849 --> 03:27:22.859 align:start position:0%
were kind of mandatory and easy and wide
 
03:27:26.210 --> 03:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
open it opened the door for more Supply
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
to be consumed than they had been so so
 
03:27:31.790 --> 03:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
I I don't know I don't know how you
 
03:27:34.309 --> 03:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
split that you know maybe in testimony
 
03:27:36.590 --> 03:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
if it sounds like it ought to be seven
 
03:27:39.229 --> 03:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
dollars per student instead of 15 but
 
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying I want us to
 
03:27:43.849 --> 03:27:43.859 align:start position:0%
recognize that there is this wedge where
 
03:27:46.729 --> 03:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
we violated 28a when we imposed an
 
03:27:49.370 --> 03:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
additional mandate causing them
 
03:27:52.130 --> 03:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
additional costs we we are at least
 
03:27:54.229 --> 03:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
obligated to meet the additional costs
 
03:27:57.290 --> 03:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:59.210 --> 03:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:28:02.510 --> 03:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
03:28:04.729 --> 03:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
represent representative Murray thank
 
03:28:07.309 --> 03:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair along similar lines I guess
 
03:28:10.490 --> 03:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
given your primary concern here seems to
 
03:28:12.710 --> 03:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
be the unconstitutionality of the
 
03:28:15.050 --> 03:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
current situation if this does not pass
 
03:28:17.030 --> 03:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
do you see it impacting what's going on
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
now will that will the current policy
 
03:28:20.090 --> 03:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
and the current
 
03:28:23.570 --> 03:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
um form of doing this maintain
 
03:28:26.389 --> 03:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
okay so practically probably not because
 
03:28:30.530 --> 03:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
in uh let's say people who are trained
 
03:28:33.469 --> 03:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
and experienced in the art do see this
 
03:28:35.290 --> 03:28:35.300 align:start position:0%
as being an
 
03:28:35.300 --> 03:28:37.030 align:start position:0%
as being an
unconstitutional

03:28:37.030 --> 03:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
03:28:41.269 --> 03:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
intrusion on based on 28a it would still
 
03:28:43.429 --> 03:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
be incumbent upon a school district to
 
03:28:46.309 --> 03:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
Sue and the cost of a lawsuit probably
 
03:28:48.889 --> 03:28:48.899 align:start position:0%
is not worth the amount that they would
 
03:28:52.070 --> 03:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
save and so so we've kind of found this
 
03:28:56.990 --> 03:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
little back Pond or back pool of things
 
03:28:58.550 --> 03:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
that we're doing wrong that we should
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
get right but nobody wants to do the
 
03:29:03.530 --> 03:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
right thing to fix it in the first place
 
03:29:06.290 --> 03:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
so so I'm I'm proposing that we just fix
 
03:29:06.300 --> 03:29:08.330 align:start position:0%
so so I'm I'm proposing that we just fix
it

03:29:08.330 --> 03:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:29:09.769 --> 03:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:29:11.809 --> 03:29:11.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:29:11.819 --> 03:29:12.889 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

03:29:12.889 --> 03:29:12.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:16.190 --> 03:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
in that vein
 
03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
is there can you speak to the
 
03:29:21.410 --> 03:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the costs if there
 
03:29:22.910 --> 03:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
were vandalism or what schools would
 
03:29:24.530 --> 03:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
03:29:25.910 --> 03:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
um if you're saying that it's
 
03:29:28.550 --> 03:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional to for the schools to
 
03:29:30.110 --> 03:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
provide this on their own as opposed to
 
03:29:32.210 --> 03:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
the state providing it then you also
 
03:29:33.950 --> 03:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
have in here the provisions around
 
03:29:36.050 --> 03:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
vandalism do you see the state picking
 
03:29:37.610 --> 03:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
that up or does the school district pick
 
03:29:38.809 --> 03:29:38.819 align:start position:0%
that up
 
03:29:41.330 --> 03:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
so I I need to come back because I've
 
03:29:44.210 --> 03:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
been inarticulate if if your takeaway is
 
03:29:45.710 --> 03:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm I'm saying it's
 
03:29:48.290 --> 03:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional to provide them
 
03:29:51.410 --> 03:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
I it's unconstitutional for the state to
 
03:29:55.190 --> 03:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
mandate them and force the school to pay
 
03:29:57.710 --> 03:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
for it without our reimbursement that
 
03:29:59.630 --> 03:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
that's my main point yes I get that but
 
03:30:01.610 --> 03:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
now I'm asking about
 
03:30:03.229 --> 03:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
um if a school decides to do something
 
03:30:06.170 --> 03:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
for vandalism apropos protecting these
 
03:30:09.349 --> 03:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
products uh where does that lead you in
 
03:30:10.429 --> 03:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
your discussion around the
 
03:30:13.130 --> 03:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of paying for that I
 
03:30:15.590 --> 03:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
think that secondary and not tied to the
 
03:30:17.750 --> 03:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
constitutionality issue if we allow them
 
03:30:20.929 --> 03:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
to implement common sense safeguards to
 
03:30:25.370 --> 03:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
prevent vandalism and theft then I I
 
03:30:27.349 --> 03:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
just think that's good public policy I
 
03:30:29.690 --> 03:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
don't think any of us are pro vandalism
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
or theft so
 
03:30:34.370 --> 03:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
um so so I don't I don't see that as
 
03:30:36.410 --> 03:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
part of the Constitutional issue I just
 
03:30:38.210 --> 03:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
that that's more of the good government
 
03:30:40.969 --> 03:30:40.979 align:start position:0%
part of this from my point of view in
 
03:30:42.229 --> 03:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
local control they know what they're
 
03:30:42.239 --> 03:30:44.269 align:start position:0%
local control they know what they're
doing

03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:30:46.070 --> 03:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:30:48.170 --> 03:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
representative leishman thanks Mr
 
03:30:50.570 --> 03:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
chairman and thanks uh chairman Edwards
 
03:30:52.910 --> 03:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question are you aware of
 
03:30:55.490 --> 03:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
any school districts not providing these
 
03:30:57.490 --> 03:30:57.500 align:start position:0%
products at the moment
 
03:31:00.710 --> 03:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
I think all the school districts for the
 
03:31:03.410 --> 03:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
last two terms have been mandated by law
 
03:31:06.830 --> 03:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
to comply with this requirement I so I'm
 
03:31:08.690 --> 03:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
going to just change your question a
 
03:31:10.550 --> 03:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
little bit because I think it's a more
 
03:31:13.969 --> 03:31:13.979 align:start position:0%
interesting question to to ask prior to
 
03:31:15.889 --> 03:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
our passing the law were there any
 
03:31:19.250 --> 03:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
schools that we're not helping kids get
 
03:31:21.070 --> 03:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
the medical supplies that they needed
 
03:31:23.750 --> 03:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
and although there were a number of
 
03:31:25.910 --> 03:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
anecdotal horror stories during the
 
03:31:28.130 --> 03:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
testimony and I was I was I don't
 
03:31:29.630 --> 03:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
remember if I was on a relevant
 
03:31:31.550 --> 03:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
committee or if I was just interested in
 
03:31:33.170 --> 03:31:33.180 align:start position:0%
the topic but
 
03:31:36.170 --> 03:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
um but what what you heard were these
 
03:31:38.510 --> 03:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
sort of generic arguments that you know
 
03:31:40.309 --> 03:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
bad things are happening because girls
 
03:31:42.769 --> 03:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
are too intimidated to go to the school
 
03:31:44.750 --> 03:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
nurse or it's not appropriate or it's
 
03:31:47.269 --> 03:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
too inconvenient but I I don't recall
 
03:31:50.630 --> 03:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
any specific examples of here's School X
 
03:31:54.050 --> 03:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
and town y that is not providing this
 
03:31:56.510 --> 03:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
Supply to our students
 
03:31:59.450 --> 03:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks Mr chairman
 
03:32:02.690 --> 03:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
further committee questions
 
03:32:04.610 --> 03:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:32:04.620 --> 03:32:06.650 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
what

03:32:06.650 --> 03:32:06.660 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:32:09.229 --> 03:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I gave you two cards sir one is
 
03:32:12.229 --> 03:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
principal Collins and one is uh the
 
03:32:19.490 --> 03:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:22.070 --> 03:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
I apologize for my handwriting
 
03:32:25.010 --> 03:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
so so he doesn't want us to do cursive
 
03:32:37.990 --> 03:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:41.450 --> 03:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate you listening to
 
03:32:45.590 --> 03:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:48.769 --> 03:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking to you operationally and
 
03:32:51.650 --> 03:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
I'm just giving you my experience we
 
03:32:54.769 --> 03:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
installed we have a K-8 school so we
 
03:32:57.170 --> 03:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
have Littles and Biggs they share
 
03:33:00.769 --> 03:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
bathrooms we installed dispensers we
 
03:33:03.170 --> 03:33:03.180 align:start position:0%
purchased and installed special
 
03:33:06.229 --> 03:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
dispensers that did not require money
 
03:33:10.670 --> 03:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
and we filled them with tampons and pads
 
03:33:13.070 --> 03:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
since we've done that and I believe it
 
03:33:15.830 --> 03:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
was last July that the bill came into
 
03:33:15.840 --> 03:33:16.910 align:start position:0%
was last July that the bill came into
play

03:33:16.910 --> 03:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
play
 
03:33:20.690 --> 03:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
we have had septic issues we have had
 
03:33:24.170 --> 03:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
pads stuck to ceilings pads stuck to
 
03:33:27.110 --> 03:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
walls and it is really not the fact that
 
03:33:29.809 --> 03:33:29.819 align:start position:0%
we've like you said representative of
 
03:33:32.990 --> 03:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
Stringham we've always provided these
 
03:33:35.750 --> 03:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
products to our students we provided it
 
03:33:38.630 --> 03:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
through them through guidance counselors
 
03:33:42.170 --> 03:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
through female teachers through our
 
03:33:45.530 --> 03:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
nurse through myself as principal so we
 
03:33:48.410 --> 03:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
were there for our students personally
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
on a more personal basis now we have
 
03:33:53.950 --> 03:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
students going into the bathrooms
 
03:33:57.110 --> 03:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
stuffing the toilets and it's it's
 
03:34:00.349 --> 03:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
costly and and I think my point with
 
03:34:03.530 --> 03:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards was I went from
 
03:34:05.929 --> 03:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
something that worked really really well
 
03:34:08.690 --> 03:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
to something that I see a lot of waste
 
03:34:12.530 --> 03:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
and it's just really purely operational
 
03:34:15.950 --> 03:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
and waste is my perspective of bringing
 
03:34:19.309 --> 03:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
this to to you today
 
03:34:21.410 --> 03:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
03:34:24.170 --> 03:34:24.180 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
03:34:26.090 --> 03:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney
 
03:34:27.650 --> 03:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
03:34:29.570 --> 03:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm sorry that that
 
03:34:32.090 --> 03:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
happened to you and your school
 
03:34:34.010 --> 03:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
um you helped to craft the language of
 
03:34:36.710 --> 03:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
this bill I assume or you helped to
 
03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
draft it to some degree my question is
 
03:34:42.469 --> 03:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
this there's no opt out of this
 
03:34:44.750 --> 03:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
so what are your thoughts on that sound
 
03:34:46.210 --> 03:34:46.220 align:start position:0%
like you had a system that was working
 
03:34:47.929 --> 03:34:47.939 align:start position:0%
and now
 
03:34:50.330 --> 03:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
um this further says that it's just
 
03:34:52.309 --> 03:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
going to be done in a different way
 
03:35:02.030 --> 03:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:04.130 --> 03:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
red light good afternoon everyone my
 
03:35:05.510 --> 03:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
name is Alan villanov I'm the school
 
03:35:08.570 --> 03:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
board chair last 17 years
 
03:35:11.030 --> 03:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
um that's really a policy question
 
03:35:12.349 --> 03:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
um we were here more to speak about the
 
03:35:14.870 --> 03:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
cost that this is uh driven up for us on
 
03:35:16.370 --> 03:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
our budget
 
03:35:18.889 --> 03:35:18.899 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't believe there is as
 
03:35:20.630 --> 03:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
you point out any language about opting
 
03:35:22.429 --> 03:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
out if that was something that you
 
03:35:23.690 --> 03:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
wanted to change I think that's a
 
03:35:25.790 --> 03:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
completely different bill
 
03:35:27.950 --> 03:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think would have we might
 
03:35:29.450 --> 03:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
be interested in such a thing because we
 
03:35:31.610 --> 03:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
we weren't a district that was
 
03:35:34.490 --> 03:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
interested in the the first uh iteration
 
03:35:37.070 --> 03:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
of this anyway as Dr Collins points out
 
03:35:41.090 --> 03:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
it wasn't an issue for us before now the
 
03:35:42.650 --> 03:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
legislature has put something on us that
 
03:35:45.229 --> 03:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
is actually an issue so it's not just
 
03:35:47.929 --> 03:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
the waste product but we we're having
 
03:35:49.790 --> 03:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
trouble as perhaps many other districts
 
03:35:52.969 --> 03:35:52.979 align:start position:0%
are in in employment of uh clean Crews
 
03:35:55.370 --> 03:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
and staff and janitors so every anytime
 
03:35:56.690 --> 03:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
any of this stuff goes wrong in the
 
03:35:58.849 --> 03:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
bathroom that's time that we have to
 
03:36:01.010 --> 03:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
take away from our cleaning crew and
 
03:36:03.349 --> 03:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
again our custodial staff to go and deal
 
03:36:04.849 --> 03:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
with this we're already down two
 
03:36:04.859 --> 03:36:06.349 align:start position:0%
with this we're already down two
janitors

03:36:06.349 --> 03:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
janitors
 
03:36:08.510 --> 03:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's very costly we we had
 
03:36:09.710 --> 03:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
the money to put in for the machines
 
03:36:12.650 --> 03:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
that weren't wasn't reimbursed which is
 
03:36:14.990 --> 03:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
fine and you know I I understand the
 
03:36:16.570 --> 03:36:16.580 align:start position:0%
unders the
 
03:36:19.370 --> 03:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
regressiveness of part of the bill to
 
03:36:20.690 --> 03:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
pay for the old things we'd be happy to
 
03:36:23.150 --> 03:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
move forward in Auburn with with just
 
03:36:25.550 --> 03:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
paying for it Forward I mean it is I
 
03:36:27.710 --> 03:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
know in in representative strangle's
 
03:36:30.290 --> 03:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
district perhaps it's you know 800 or
 
03:36:32.570 --> 03:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
something but that's still that's just
 
03:36:34.250 --> 03:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
the cost of a product it's not the cost
 
03:36:36.830 --> 03:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
of somebody going to fill the machine to
 
03:36:38.510 --> 03:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
maintain that machine again the cleanup
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
and all these other things it's it's
 
03:36:41.630 --> 03:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars in these districts
 
03:36:44.030 --> 03:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
or at least in our district to say
 
03:36:45.349 --> 03:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
nothing of what happens in the much
 
03:36:47.630 --> 03:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
larger districts where we are just a
 
03:36:49.910 --> 03:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful little kid Aid school you
 
03:36:51.710 --> 03:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
should stop by sometime
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
um so we're just trying to to do right
 
03:36:56.870 --> 03:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
by our taxpayers as well I don't know if
 
03:37:00.290 --> 03:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt for did you want
 
03:37:06.110 --> 03:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
to add further if I may add I I feel as
 
03:37:06.120 --> 03:37:07.070 align:start position:0%
to add further if I may add I I feel as
though

03:37:07.070 --> 03:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
though
 
03:37:09.769 --> 03:37:09.779 align:start position:0%
um a student alone in a bathroom dealing
 
03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
with some of the things that they're
 
03:37:14.929 --> 03:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
dealing with is is not a great situation
 
03:37:17.750 --> 03:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
given the mental health situation of a
 
03:37:21.290 --> 03:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
lot of our students today and that
 
03:37:23.690 --> 03:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
connection that that just that one
 
03:37:27.410 --> 03:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
incident might connect them to someone
 
03:37:29.929 --> 03:37:29.939 align:start position:0%
in our school that will be their trusted
 
03:37:33.229 --> 03:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
adult forevermore because they know that
 
03:37:36.410 --> 03:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
that person helped them with that so I
 
03:37:39.290 --> 03:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
feel as though I think Jess said it is
 
03:37:41.630 --> 03:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
like have faith that we are there for
 
03:37:45.170 --> 03:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
our students and that we will do our job
 
03:37:47.929 --> 03:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt for a question
 
03:37:50.450 --> 03:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
is there is there anything in the
 
03:37:52.490 --> 03:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
current law that requires you to have
 
03:37:54.650 --> 03:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
machines and to do this in the in the
 
03:37:54.660 --> 03:37:56.410 align:start position:0%
machines and to do this in the in the
bathroom

03:37:56.410 --> 03:37:56.420 align:start position:0%
bathroom
 
03:37:59.110 --> 03:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
that is the current law
 
03:38:02.929 --> 03:38:02.939 align:start position:0%
very good man mandated by a previous
 
03:38:02.939 --> 03:38:05.030 align:start position:0%
very good man mandated by a previous
legislature

03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:38:08.510 --> 03:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:38:15.710 --> 03:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
next have a card from representative
 
03:38:28.130 --> 03:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:29.990 --> 03:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Steve
 
03:38:31.790 --> 03:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
Woodcock I represent Conway New
 
03:38:34.729 --> 03:38:34.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and I just like to speak a
 
03:38:37.550 --> 03:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
minute about the bill uh not about the
 
03:38:38.750 --> 03:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill representative
 
03:38:41.210 --> 03:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
Edwards has talked about that how this
 
03:38:42.710 --> 03:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
bill came into play
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure as to respond to
 
03:38:46.370 --> 03:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt's question I'm not
 
03:38:48.469 --> 03:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
sure it requires that it has a
 
03:38:51.790 --> 03:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
mechanical distribution piece in the law
 
03:38:55.969 --> 03:38:55.979 align:start position:0%
but beyond that my concern here today is
 
03:38:59.210 --> 03:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
that the bill was initiated uh because
 
03:39:01.190 --> 03:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
of an attendance issue
 
03:39:02.870 --> 03:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
if you recall those of you in the United
 
03:39:05.210 --> 03:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
States should be four uh because we're
 
03:39:07.550 --> 03:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
talking about three or four days per
 
03:39:09.170 --> 03:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
month of students who did not attend
 
03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
particularly from low income areas times
 
03:39:13.929 --> 03:39:13.939 align:start position:0%
10 months that's 30 days of school time
 
03:39:17.330 --> 03:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
those students weren't there uh and that
 
03:39:20.330 --> 03:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
still was existing uh if you recall at
 
03:39:21.889 --> 03:39:21.899 align:start position:0%
that point I testified in the floor as
 
03:39:24.290 --> 03:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
an actual example of the teacher and
 
03:39:26.990 --> 03:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
having that circumstance and it was not
 
03:39:29.870 --> 03:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
just a student it was widespread
 
03:39:34.309 --> 03:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
my my concern with the mechanism that's
 
03:39:37.070 --> 03:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
before you today is not is not the the
 
03:39:40.490 --> 03:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh method uh my concern is that this may
 
03:39:42.590 --> 03:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
negate the law when you go to the
 
03:39:46.490 --> 03:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
section in terms of line 15 16 and 17.
 
03:39:50.330 --> 03:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
and that was the that was the opt-out or
 
03:39:52.969 --> 03:39:52.979 align:start position:0%
the general inference from years ago
 
03:39:55.729 --> 03:39:55.739 align:start position:0%
well we can we can go to the school and
 
03:39:58.130 --> 03:39:58.140 align:start position:0%
error so we can go to the phys ed
 
03:40:01.010 --> 03:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
teacher or a female nurse or someone and
 
03:40:02.809 --> 03:40:02.819 align:start position:0%
it did cause a stigma it did cause long
 
03:40:06.349 --> 03:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
lines and I I feel uh unfortunate for
 
03:40:07.790 --> 03:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
the Village Elementary School but it may
 
03:40:09.110 --> 03:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
be because it's an elementary school and
 
03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's a but it may not be but nothing
 
03:40:12.710 --> 03:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
requires that
 
03:40:14.809 --> 03:40:14.819 align:start position:0%
um so that was my concern that the the
 
03:40:17.929 --> 03:40:17.939 align:start position:0%
intent of the law is doing well uh
 
03:40:19.370 --> 03:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
sitting in the education committee I
 
03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to speak with
 
03:40:22.910 --> 03:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
principals administrators often and
 
03:40:25.790 --> 03:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
vandalism is rare uh what was what was
 
03:40:27.349 --> 03:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
happening initially was a lot of the
 
03:40:28.910 --> 03:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
product was going because people didn't
 
03:40:31.010 --> 03:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
expect it to be there and then it wasn't
 
03:40:33.290 --> 03:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
when it wasn't was there next month and
 
03:40:35.210 --> 03:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
next week the next day that that stopped
 
03:40:37.849 --> 03:40:37.859 align:start position:0%
uh some folks just have just regular
 
03:40:41.389 --> 03:40:41.399 align:start position:0%
straw baskets there it's not intended as
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
a fifteen dollars and the other part is
 
03:40:45.229 --> 03:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
the cost here it's not intended for
 
03:40:48.290 --> 03:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars per per student
 
03:40:48.300 --> 03:40:48.889 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars per per student
um

03:40:48.889 --> 03:40:48.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:50.750 --> 03:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
for the cost of this because we both
 
03:40:52.849 --> 03:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
know that's not these aren't high
 
03:40:55.070 --> 03:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
quality high qual top products these
 
03:40:57.410 --> 03:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
aren't the tampix Galore these are
 
03:40:59.330 --> 03:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
random generic pieces
 
03:41:01.670 --> 03:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
um so it's not a big demand item by many
 
03:41:03.110 --> 03:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
of the women most that can afford to
 
03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
have their own menstrual products at
 
03:41:06.110 --> 03:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
home these are the folks that can't
 
03:41:07.670 --> 03:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
afford it that was the whole point of
 
03:41:10.910 --> 03:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
this and and just to update on the cost
 
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
to concern me so just for your own
 
03:41:16.370 --> 03:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
iteration today's Walmart prices
 
03:41:23.750 --> 03:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
36 Tampax 5.98 36 tampons 970. uh pads
 
03:41:28.190 --> 03:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
from equate 60 for 8.97 and I guess the
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
always must be a higher brand 36 for 10
 
03:41:32.990 --> 03:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
47. having not used any of those
 
03:41:35.389 --> 03:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
products I cannot verify the quality I'm
 
03:41:37.849 --> 03:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
just telling you what today's market was
 
03:41:41.269 --> 03:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
um so I think the 15 dollars per student
 
03:41:43.550 --> 03:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
is way over way overpriced if you're
 
03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
going to reimburse anyone and it's not
 
03:41:48.110 --> 03:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
it's not for everyone it's not it's not
 
03:41:51.710 --> 03:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
the intent so my concern frankly is is
 
03:41:51.720 --> 03:41:54.050 align:start position:0%
the intent so my concern frankly is is
um

03:41:54.050 --> 03:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:56.750 --> 03:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
just the loss of the law that when you
 
03:41:59.030 --> 03:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
go to 15 we'll get to well the guidance
 
03:42:01.070 --> 03:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
counselor has it the teacher has it go
 
03:42:02.870 --> 03:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
see someone else and we know what
 
03:42:04.250 --> 03:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
happened there it doesn't happen as you
 
03:42:06.650 --> 03:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
get older it's just like we we're all
 
03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
aware of the kids and for the most part
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
who are in high school who have free
 
03:42:12.110 --> 03:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch or don't go because they
 
03:42:13.610 --> 03:42:13.620 align:start position:0%
can't put it because they they can't do
 
03:42:15.349 --> 03:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
that and this is the bulk of the kids we
 
03:42:18.290 --> 03:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
have here so I'm asking you to uh think
 
03:42:20.690 --> 03:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
about as you discuss this law and exec
 
03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
on this law those that input I'll be
 
03:42:25.010 --> 03:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions I thank you for
 
03:42:26.090 --> 03:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
your time
 
03:42:27.710 --> 03:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for questions
 
03:42:31.910 --> 03:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:33.650 --> 03:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:42:33.660 --> 03:42:36.590 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
again

03:42:36.590 --> 03:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:38.269 --> 03:42:38.279 align:start position:0%
I have a card from
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:51.530 --> 03:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:53.510 --> 03:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:42:53.520 --> 03:42:54.110 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and
um

03:42:54.110 --> 03:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
all of the committee I appreciate being
 
03:42:57.349 --> 03:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
in front of my name is Jeff Monroe I'm
 
03:43:01.370 --> 03:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
CEO of uh representing a brand of new
 
03:43:04.670 --> 03:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
innovation called egal pads on a roll
 
03:43:07.010 --> 03:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh when you pass this bill many years
 
03:43:09.050 --> 03:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
ago I've been in the janitorial business
 
03:43:11.809 --> 03:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
for 42 years calling on all your schools
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
so I have a vast background of of the
 
03:43:17.090 --> 03:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
Jansen and what it is
 
03:43:18.950 --> 03:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to make some points on a new
 
03:43:20.630 --> 03:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
technology that's out there that will
 
03:43:22.849 --> 03:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
reduce costs and still give your
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
constituents uh the product they need
 
03:43:28.010 --> 03:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
it's based on a rolling could be on it
 
03:43:31.190 --> 03:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
on a toilet paper holder not a machine
 
03:43:34.309 --> 03:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
that costs three hundred dollars so I
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a few points that we have
 
03:43:38.630 --> 03:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
economical Solutions today that I'd like
 
03:43:41.510 --> 03:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
you to be considered on you don't have
 
03:43:44.269 --> 03:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
to buy an expensive machine with the pro
 
03:43:47.750 --> 03:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
of pill fridge maybe there's not a
 
03:43:51.050 --> 03:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
receptacle there and maybe it's a pin of
 
03:43:53.570 --> 03:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
of us educating the facilities manager
 
03:43:56.750 --> 03:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
so that would be part of our job the
 
03:43:58.150 --> 03:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
product is being
 
03:44:02.210 --> 03:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
tested right now at UNH and city of
 
03:44:04.550 --> 03:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
Cambridge today I'll just give you an
 
03:44:09.849 --> 03:44:09.859 align:start position:0%
idea had a budget of 15 but the Sanitary
 
03:44:12.469 --> 03:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
products really come down to to about
 
03:44:15.050 --> 03:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
two to three dollars out of that budget
 
03:44:18.650 --> 03:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
and the last point is we need to be we
 
03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
need to have equality uh you know
 
03:44:23.389 --> 03:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
there's no one carrying toilet paper
 
03:44:26.870 --> 03:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
into the uh stall
 
03:44:28.910 --> 03:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
um it's a woman's right to have that
 
03:44:32.809 --> 03:44:32.819 align:start position:0%
equality for uh what what she does in
 
03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
the in this in the uh cost of this is
 
03:44:37.610 --> 03:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
not what you think
 
03:44:37.620 --> 03:44:39.229 align:start position:0%
not what you think
so

03:44:39.229 --> 03:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:41.389 --> 03:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
um that's my statements thank you Mr
 
03:44:43.130 --> 03:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
chairman appreciate the information
 
03:44:44.570 --> 03:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:44:46.969 --> 03:44:46.979 align:start position:0%
representative Mueller thank you Mr
 
03:44:48.469 --> 03:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:44:51.050 --> 03:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
question I thought I heard you say that
 
03:44:52.790 --> 03:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
this may reduce Bill footing I
 
03:44:54.349 --> 03:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
completely understand what it reduces
 
03:44:56.210 --> 03:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
cost because it's much you know more
 
03:44:58.729 --> 03:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
economically you know feasible than a
 
03:45:00.830 --> 03:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
dispenser but I have no idea how putting
 
03:45:02.150 --> 03:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
this on a roll would actually reduce
 
03:45:04.250 --> 03:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
pillfering did I misunderstand or could
 
03:45:06.410 --> 03:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
you elaborate they will you know there
 
03:45:08.990 --> 03:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
will be there will be some pilferring
 
03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
but uh what I've found in putting out
 
03:45:12.469 --> 03:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
the biggest towel system in the United
 
03:45:12.479 --> 03:45:13.490 align:start position:0%
the biggest towel system in the United
States

03:45:13.490 --> 03:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
States
 
03:45:16.910 --> 03:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
um there will be in initially but the
 
03:45:19.610 --> 03:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
role goes on and it also has a dispenser
 
03:45:22.550 --> 03:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
too which will be dispensed one at a
 
03:45:22.560 --> 03:45:23.210 align:start position:0%
too which will be dispensed one at a
time

03:45:23.210 --> 03:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:45:23.220 --> 03:45:24.670 align:start position:0%
time
so

03:45:24.670 --> 03:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:28.070 --> 03:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
economically there will be some in the
 
03:45:31.070 --> 03:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
beginning but state of Utah has mandated
 
03:45:33.769 --> 03:45:33.779 align:start position:0%
it totally and 19 other states just so
 
03:45:34.910 --> 03:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:45:37.309 --> 03:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:45:38.990 --> 03:45:39.000 align:start position:0%

I am representative Greg Hill

um serving the town of Northfield
 
03:47:13.250 --> 03:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
the snowy town of Northfield
 
03:47:17.210 --> 03:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
um I think I have in front of you a
 
03:47:21.790 --> 03:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
fairly easy Bill to uh to handle it's
 
03:47:25.670 --> 03:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory it's simply looking uh
 
03:47:27.290 --> 03:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
for an amount of money a hundred
 
03:47:29.809 --> 03:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to uh
 
03:47:32.929 --> 03:47:32.939 align:start position:0%
to begin the process of recodification
 
03:47:36.130 --> 03:47:36.140 align:start position:0%
of our education statutes
 
03:47:38.269 --> 03:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
this has been something that's been
 
03:47:40.250 --> 03:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
talked about since I've been here in
 
03:47:40.260 --> 03:47:41.950 align:start position:0%
talked about since I've been here in
2010

03:47:41.950 --> 03:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
2010
 
03:47:44.690 --> 03:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
but to my knowledge nothing has been
 
03:47:46.990 --> 03:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
attempted in along those lines
 
03:47:50.710 --> 03:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
I believe this is a nonpartisan idea
 
03:47:54.290 --> 03:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that what happened just
 
03:47:55.990 --> 03:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
in the last year
 
03:47:59.150 --> 03:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
pointed out the need for it for me and
 
03:48:01.729 --> 03:48:01.739 align:start position:0%
maybe this will help some of the the
 
03:48:04.570 --> 03:48:04.580 align:start position:0%
newer members of your Committee
 
03:48:08.330 --> 03:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
in my town we had two mathematics
 
03:48:11.750 --> 03:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
teachers both eighth grade
 
03:48:13.429 --> 03:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
um both of them taking continuing
 
03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
education to get a master's
 
03:48:19.570 --> 03:48:19.580 align:start position:0%
both of them borrowed money to do that
 
03:48:22.309 --> 03:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
from two different lenders
 
03:48:25.729 --> 03:48:25.739 align:start position:0%
the lenders after the program completed
 
03:48:27.590 --> 03:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
and they and they submitted their
 
03:48:27.600 --> 03:48:29.050 align:start position:0%
and they and they submitted their
paperwork

03:48:29.050 --> 03:48:29.060 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
03:48:33.229 --> 03:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
one lender reimbursed seventeen thousand
 
03:48:36.349 --> 03:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
and the other reimbursed eight thousand
 
03:48:39.070 --> 03:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
and the only difference was
 
03:48:41.050 --> 03:48:41.060 align:start position:0%
the company
 
03:48:44.450 --> 03:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
determined one company determined that
 
03:48:47.150 --> 03:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
the eighth grade teacher was a primary
 
03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
school or Elementary School teacher and
 
03:48:53.450 --> 03:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
and pointed out the rsas that they use
 
03:48:56.150 --> 03:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
for to calculate that and the other
 
03:48:58.610 --> 03:48:58.620 align:start position:0%
program considered the eighth grade to
 
03:49:00.309 --> 03:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
be a secondary school
 
03:49:03.769 --> 03:49:03.779 align:start position:0%
teacher and pointed to the rsas that
 
03:49:05.090 --> 03:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
showed that
 
03:49:09.710 --> 03:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
so this is this is
 
03:49:12.410 --> 03:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
illustrative of of the problem that we
 
03:49:16.910 --> 03:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
have that in some cases our our rsas are
 
03:49:20.030 --> 03:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
conflicting and some they're duplicative
 
03:49:23.210 --> 03:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
in some cases they're missing
 
03:49:26.570 --> 03:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
um so this is a situation where I think
 
03:49:29.630 --> 03:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
instead of just layering Solution on
 
03:49:32.150 --> 03:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
solution it may be a good time to start
 
03:49:34.030 --> 03:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
recodification entirely
 
03:49:40.190 --> 03:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
um I will point out two pieces of the
 
03:49:42.889 --> 03:49:42.899 align:start position:0%
bill that uh or two notes I guess I
 
03:49:46.070 --> 03:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
would like you to take note of or or be
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
aware of one is um Roman three
 
03:49:51.229 --> 03:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
where it says the commissioner or
 
03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
designee shall have exclusive
 
03:49:57.530 --> 03:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
supervisory authority over the attorney
 
03:50:00.590 --> 03:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
apparently the commissioner is not
 
03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
thrilled about that piece of language
 
03:50:04.910 --> 03:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
and so there may be a an amendment
 
03:50:09.290 --> 03:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
coming or forthcoming to division two uh
 
03:50:11.330 --> 03:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
probably tomorrow I'm guessing you may
 
03:50:14.229 --> 03:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
want to ask the doe that is
 
03:50:17.269 --> 03:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
representative that is here the second
 
03:50:20.210 --> 03:50:20.220 align:start position:0%
is uh the OLS director stopped me in the
 
03:50:24.010 --> 03:50:24.020 align:start position:0%
hallway just before 1 30 to mention that
 
03:50:27.769 --> 03:50:27.779 align:start position:0%
this is an idea that OLS is reviewing as
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
well and they think that there may be
 
03:50:30.720 --> 03:50:31.870 align:start position:0%
well and they think that there may be
um

03:50:31.870 --> 03:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:36.290 --> 03:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
Merit to perhaps do looking at this
 
03:50:41.510 --> 03:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
model for all of uh our statutes so this
 
03:50:43.849 --> 03:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
this will be an ongoing situation that
 
03:50:46.130 --> 03:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
you can uh you can be sure will be
 
03:50:48.110 --> 03:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
coming your way
 
03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
um with that I'm happy to answer any
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any
 
03:50:56.469 --> 03:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
um but I would like to get some honest
 
03:50:59.570 --> 03:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
footwork ahead here to to see if we can
 
03:51:01.870 --> 03:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
get something going for a recodification
 
03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
03:51:05.570 --> 03:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
03:51:05.580 --> 03:51:06.889 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
cabrills

03:51:06.889 --> 03:51:06.899 align:start position:0%
cabrills
 
03:51:09.410 --> 03:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you uh
 
03:51:10.870 --> 03:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
03:51:13.670 --> 03:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
given the hundred thousand dollars that
 
03:51:16.190 --> 03:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
would be allocated and given whatever
 
03:51:18.769 --> 03:51:18.779 align:start position:0%
the attorney's fees may be what
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of the education statutes you
 
03:51:23.450 --> 03:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
think you'd be able they would be able
 
03:51:26.990 --> 03:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
to cover with a hundred thousand dollars
 
03:51:29.450 --> 03:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
um my hope is all of them
 
03:51:31.429 --> 03:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
if if I thought it was going to cover
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
half I would have made it two hundred
 
03:51:33.359 --> 03:51:35.929 align:start position:0%
half I would have made it two hundred
thousand

03:51:35.929 --> 03:51:35.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:37.370 --> 03:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for your
 
03:51:37.380 --> 03:51:39.410 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for your
question

03:51:39.410 --> 03:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:45.650 --> 03:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
03:51:47.870 --> 03:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:51:47.880 --> 03:51:49.010 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman thank you
representative

03:51:49.010 --> 03:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:51:51.769 --> 03:51:51.779 align:start position:0%
at one time the legislature had a
 
03:51:54.610 --> 03:51:54.620 align:start position:0%
special Committee just for recodific
 
03:51:58.370 --> 03:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
recodifying laws do you think this is a
 
03:52:01.370 --> 03:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
might be a better task for a legislative
 
03:52:05.090 --> 03:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
committee or possibly a summer uh for
 
03:52:08.450 --> 03:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
for the education committee
 
03:52:12.229 --> 03:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question I um
 
03:52:14.090 --> 03:52:14.100 align:start position:0%
I have no idea
 
03:52:14.100 --> 03:52:14.750 align:start position:0%
I have no idea
um

03:52:14.750 --> 03:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:16.610 --> 03:52:16.620 align:start position:0%
the honest answer
 
03:52:16.620 --> 03:52:17.269 align:start position:0%
the honest answer
um

03:52:17.269 --> 03:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:20.269 --> 03:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
I really just want something to get done
 
03:52:22.130 --> 03:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
um it's clear that something needs to be
 
03:52:24.410 --> 03:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
done and we can talk about uh additional
 
03:52:26.389 --> 03:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
committees we had a committee on
 
03:52:28.010 --> 03:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
committees for instance uh
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
representative evil will attest and that
 
03:52:32.450 --> 03:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
took us two terms before we could get
 
03:52:35.510 --> 03:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
that accomplished so
 
03:52:39.670 --> 03:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
um this was my best shot at trying to
 
03:52:42.469 --> 03:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
make something happen so I appreciate
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:47.990 --> 03:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie for a question
 
03:52:50.269 --> 03:52:50.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh if you remember
 
03:52:53.570 --> 03:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
right uh 11 12 we looked at this very
 
03:52:56.269 --> 03:52:56.279 align:start position:0%
carefully on the education committee we
 
03:52:58.370 --> 03:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
figured it'd take six years
 
03:53:01.130 --> 03:53:01.140 align:start position:0%
to do this properly to go through the
 
03:53:05.150 --> 03:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
education law which is quite a big task
 
03:53:08.210 --> 03:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
it would overlap several terms
 
03:53:09.769 --> 03:53:09.779 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
03:53:13.010 --> 03:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question uh the
 
03:53:14.690 --> 03:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
representatives memory is much better
 
03:53:17.690 --> 03:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:19.250 --> 03:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:53:25.670 --> 03:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:27.349 --> 03:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
numeral two
 
03:53:30.710 --> 03:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
legislation as it's proposed the report
 
03:53:32.210 --> 03:53:32.220 align:start position:0%
and findings
 
03:53:34.090 --> 03:53:34.100 align:start position:0%
for any recommendations would be
 
03:53:36.229 --> 03:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
basically given to the commissioner of
 
03:53:38.809 --> 03:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education solely I'm
 
03:53:40.610 --> 03:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
wondering what the thought process is
 
03:53:43.790 --> 03:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
through this section my question is if
 
03:53:45.769 --> 03:53:45.779 align:start position:0%
we're expending public dollars shouldn't
 
03:53:48.889 --> 03:53:48.899 align:start position:0%
there be some public reporting as well
 
03:53:50.990 --> 03:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:51.710 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
um

03:53:51.710 --> 03:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:53.769 --> 03:53:53.779 align:start position:0%
it would be my
 
03:53:57.290 --> 03:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh that the attorney
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
shall report uh the findings and
 
03:54:02.450 --> 03:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the commissioner but
 
03:54:04.550 --> 03:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
i s I would suggest
 
03:54:06.889 --> 03:54:06.899 align:start position:0%
um just as with the committee on
 
03:54:06.899 --> 03:54:08.090 align:start position:0%
um just as with the committee on
committees

03:54:08.090 --> 03:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
committees
 
03:54:11.030 --> 03:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
um the process was a representative
 
03:54:13.550 --> 03:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
would then submit legislation with those
 
03:54:15.670 --> 03:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations and it would come to
 
03:54:18.410 --> 03:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
another house committee and then through
 
03:54:21.410 --> 03:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
the through the Senate just the same way
 
03:54:25.010 --> 03:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
um probably could spell that all out but
 
03:54:27.050 --> 03:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
that would be my guess is how how the
 
03:54:29.870 --> 03:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
process would take place because the the
 
03:54:32.269 --> 03:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner doesn't have the ability to
 
03:54:34.490 --> 03:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
change our statutes it would it would
 
03:54:35.570 --> 03:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
have to come through and probably
 
03:54:37.670 --> 03:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
through legislative Administration the
 
03:54:41.689 --> 03:54:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:46.429 --> 03:54:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
 
03:54:51.530 --> 03:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:55:03.650 --> 03:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:05.870 --> 03:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Scott
 
03:55:07.729 --> 03:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
Rose I'm a business administrator for
 
03:55:10.550 --> 03:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
the SAU 19 and which represents
 
03:55:14.150 --> 03:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
Goffstown in New Boston I am speaking in
 
03:55:16.990 --> 03:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
favor strong favor of this bill
 
03:55:20.570 --> 03:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
most recently I sent a letter to the
 
03:55:23.090 --> 03:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Education seeking funding
 
03:55:27.290 --> 03:55:27.300 align:start position:0%
and it was for a 50 54 year old RSA I'm
 
03:55:30.950 --> 03:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to give it to you it is 198 colon
 
03:55:34.189 --> 03:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
19 and it deals with area school aid so
 
03:55:36.110 --> 03:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
when we talk about recodification we
 
03:55:37.550 --> 03:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
talk about looking over some of the
 
03:55:39.050 --> 03:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
statutes that are out there I'm going to
 
03:55:40.849 --> 03:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
indulge me almost it'll take me 30
 
03:55:43.429 --> 03:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
seconds to read it as an incentive to
 
03:55:45.170 --> 03:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
receiving and sending districts which
 
03:55:47.269 --> 03:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
undertake the obligations of an area
 
03:55:50.809 --> 03:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
school the State Board shall from funds
 
03:55:52.849 --> 03:55:52.859 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the general court to
 
03:55:54.769 --> 03:55:54.779 align:start position:0%
carry out the provisions of this chapter
 
03:55:57.670 --> 03:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
pay annually to each receiving District
 
03:55:59.870 --> 03:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
sums in accordance with the following
 
03:56:02.269 --> 03:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
schedule for each pupil from the sending
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
District in average daily membership in
 
03:56:06.530 --> 03:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
the preceding school year in an
 
03:56:08.929 --> 03:56:08.939 align:start position:0%
elementary school forty five dollars in
 
03:56:10.849 --> 03:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
a in a junior high school or equivalent
 
03:56:13.670 --> 03:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
sixty dollars in an area high school 75
 
03:56:13.680 --> 03:56:14.689 align:start position:0%
sixty dollars in an area high school 75
dollars

03:56:14.689 --> 03:56:14.699 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:56:17.510 --> 03:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
the chapter is school money not the
 
03:56:19.429 --> 03:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
section I sent a letter to the
 
03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Education requesting over
 
03:56:23.210 --> 03:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
thirty seven thousand dollars in the
 
03:56:24.410 --> 03:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
last two years
 
03:56:26.750 --> 03:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
to which I was told that the funds were
 
03:56:29.450 --> 03:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
not appropriated by the legislature but
 
03:56:31.130 --> 03:56:31.140 align:start position:0%
funds were appropriated by the
 
03:56:32.990 --> 03:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
legislature for school money so I
 
03:56:34.250 --> 03:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
disagree with the Department of
 
03:56:35.750 --> 03:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
education's attorney and their
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation my board is going to
 
03:56:40.189 --> 03:56:40.199 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not they're going to
 
03:56:40.199 --> 03:56:41.630 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not they're going to
litigate

03:56:41.630 --> 03:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
litigate
 
03:56:44.630 --> 03:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'd hate to do that because laws if this
 
03:56:47.210 --> 03:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
law needs to be off the books if that
 
03:56:49.070 --> 03:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
incentive is no longer needed then
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
strike the law but the law is on the
 
03:56:53.389 --> 03:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
books and it uses strong language it
 
03:56:55.189 --> 03:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
uses the word shall the State Board
 
03:56:57.769 --> 03:56:57.779 align:start position:0%
shall so now my board has to determine
 
03:57:00.050 --> 03:57:00.060 align:start position:0%
are they going to file a lawsuit against
 
03:57:02.090 --> 03:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
the state board and ultimately the
 
03:57:05.389 --> 03:57:05.399 align:start position:0%
legislature for a law that is not being
 
03:57:07.450 --> 03:57:07.460 align:start position:0%
currently funded or paid
 
03:57:10.429 --> 03:57:10.439 align:start position:0%
so this is just one example and I
 
03:57:12.050 --> 03:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
actually have an excellent relationship
 
03:57:14.150 --> 03:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Ed I like them
 
03:57:17.210 --> 03:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
but it's a good example of why you need
 
03:57:19.550 --> 03:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
to go through these statutes
 
03:57:22.389 --> 03:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
periodically because there is a lot of
 
03:57:26.210 --> 03:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
outdated statutes that are out there so
 
03:57:28.490 --> 03:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much and there are any
 
03:57:30.590 --> 03:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
questions I guess I'm here so
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for pointing that out
 
03:57:34.670 --> 03:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members
 
03:57:36.769 --> 03:57:36.779 align:start position:0%
Yeah question representative McGuire
 
03:57:39.050 --> 03:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for uh
 
03:57:41.809 --> 03:57:41.819 align:start position:0%
taking my question so it's possible on
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
things like this that house bill 2 might
 
03:57:47.590 --> 03:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
suspend section
 
03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
198.19 for the biennium or something
 
03:57:52.070 --> 03:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
like that do you know if that's done or
 
03:57:55.070 --> 03:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
I I don't know and that's something that
 
03:57:56.450 --> 03:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
um some certainly would have to be
 
03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
investigated by our school attorney as
 
03:58:01.550 --> 03:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
to what may or may not apply but in in
 
03:58:02.570 --> 03:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
03:58:05.450 --> 03:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
the day-to-day operations of what folks
 
03:58:07.910 --> 03:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
like myself do or perhaps uh you know
 
03:58:09.469 --> 03:58:09.479 align:start position:0%
other superintendents Etc we're looking
 
03:58:10.969 --> 03:58:10.979 align:start position:0%
at these statutes and we're trying to
 
03:58:13.490 --> 03:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
follow them to you know you you've
 
03:58:15.229 --> 03:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
created them you've enacted them we want
 
03:58:16.790 --> 03:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
to follow them we want to follow the law
 
03:58:19.610 --> 03:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
so when I read the law I don't
 
03:58:22.250 --> 03:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily know about how spill two and
 
03:58:23.450 --> 03:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
all the other things that might
 
03:58:26.750 --> 03:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
supersede it so in Candor I so for me if
 
03:58:28.070 --> 03:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
it was cleaned up it would be easier to
 
03:58:29.510 --> 03:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
say hey this and that this this never
 
03:58:32.510 --> 03:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:34.790 --> 03:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
03:58:37.550 --> 03:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps you've sent some ideas to this
 
03:58:37.560 --> 03:58:40.309 align:start position:0%
perhaps you've sent some ideas to this
lawyer

03:58:40.309 --> 03:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:42.950 --> 03:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:58:45.110 --> 03:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
no questions then next we'll call on
 
03:58:54.650 --> 03:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:00.830 --> 03:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:00.840 --> 03:59:03.410 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

03:59:03.410 --> 03:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:05.389 --> 03:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record Caitlyn
 
03:59:07.189 --> 03:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
Davis from the Department of Education I
 
03:59:09.229 --> 03:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
don't frequently bring props with me
 
03:59:12.349 --> 03:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
when I testify but this is the
 
03:59:15.050 --> 03:59:15.060 align:start position:0%
Department of Education law book
 
03:59:17.450 --> 03:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
um we sometimes see old versions used as
 
03:59:19.130 --> 03:59:19.140 align:start position:0%
door stops around this building
 
03:59:21.349 --> 03:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
specifically but as you can see it's
 
03:59:23.150 --> 03:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
quite large
 
03:59:25.670 --> 03:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
um and there's a lot of information very
 
03:59:28.130 --> 03:59:28.140 align:start position:0%
very useful information so useful in
 
03:59:29.389 --> 03:59:29.399 align:start position:0%
fact that there's a bill being heard
 
03:59:32.330 --> 03:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
right now in House Education to make
 
03:59:33.889 --> 03:59:33.899 align:start position:0%
sure the Department of Education is
 
03:59:36.469 --> 03:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
providing copies of the law book paper
 
03:59:38.450 --> 03:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
copies to all of the members on the
 
03:59:38.460 --> 03:59:39.530 align:start position:0%
copies to all of the members on the
committee

03:59:39.530 --> 03:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:59:43.250 --> 03:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
now I've been doing this since 2010
 
03:59:46.010 --> 03:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
working with you all and the number of
 
03:59:47.689 --> 03:59:47.699 align:start position:0%
times that we go through and we read
 
03:59:50.510 --> 03:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
this bill or this law book and we find
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
areas that conflict each other drive us
 
03:59:55.309 --> 03:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely crazy and I don't have a law
 
03:59:58.010 --> 03:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
degree so then I go walk down to Diana's
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
office and say Diana I found this law
 
04:00:02.870 --> 04:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
that says this and another law over here
 
04:00:04.670 --> 04:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
that conflicts with it what am I
 
04:00:06.410 --> 04:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
supposed to do do I get to pick and
 
04:00:08.389 --> 04:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
choose when it's convenient for me
 
04:00:10.969 --> 04:00:10.979 align:start position:0%
she typically says no unfortunately and
 
04:00:12.349 --> 04:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
then I ask another lawyer what their
 
04:00:14.990 --> 04:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
opinion is see if I can get a better one
 
04:00:18.170 --> 04:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
um but it's just there's laws that have
 
04:00:19.729 --> 04:00:19.739 align:start position:0%
been on the books for over a hundred
 
04:00:22.250 --> 04:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
years at the Department of Education and
 
04:00:25.070 --> 04:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
through years and years of rewriting
 
04:00:29.330 --> 04:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
better more or more consistent or just
 
04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
different laws there have been a lot of
 
04:00:34.250 --> 04:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
old things that have been with men left
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
in other areas or not touched or just
 
04:00:40.490 --> 04:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
have become become outdated over the
 
04:00:42.889 --> 04:00:42.899 align:start position:0%
years and it really is not helpful for
 
04:00:44.689 --> 04:00:44.699 align:start position:0%
the department and for school districts
 
04:00:45.830 --> 04:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
when they're trying to understand the
 
04:00:48.710 --> 04:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
work that they're required to do I can
 
04:00:50.750 --> 04:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
think of a simple example from this
 
04:00:51.650 --> 04:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
morning when we're talking about
 
04:00:53.689 --> 04:00:53.699 align:start position:0%
building aid for example so
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney started talking to
 
04:00:56.510 --> 04:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education about
 
04:00:58.670 --> 04:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
providing funding building Aid funding
 
04:01:01.969 --> 04:01:01.979 align:start position:0%
to Charter Schools a few years ago well
 
04:01:03.889 --> 04:01:03.899 align:start position:0%
she came in and she sat with Amy Clark
 
04:01:05.870 --> 04:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
and Amy Clark had said to me I don't
 
04:01:07.070 --> 04:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
know why we aren't we don't just give
 
04:01:08.689 --> 04:01:08.699 align:start position:0%
building Aid to Charter Schools the
 
04:01:10.910 --> 04:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
building a law discusses charter schools
 
04:01:12.590 --> 04:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
throughout it and what even wrote down
 
04:01:14.870 --> 04:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
what right down to what rates a charter
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
school should receive
 
04:01:18.410 --> 04:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
and then in the charter school law it
 
04:01:20.030 --> 04:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
says Charter Schools can't receive
 
04:01:21.349 --> 04:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
building AIDS
 
04:01:23.090 --> 04:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
so right then and there it's just a
 
04:01:25.429 --> 04:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
great example of a conflict there's
 
04:01:27.410 --> 04:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
another a lot of examples you know these
 
04:01:29.150 --> 04:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
laws some of them there might be a law
 
04:01:31.370 --> 04:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
from 1960 that's a great law still
 
04:01:33.769 --> 04:01:33.779 align:start position:0%
really applicable but it's unclear maybe
 
04:01:35.450 --> 04:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
if it's applicable to a charter school
 
04:01:37.610 --> 04:01:37.620 align:start position:0%
because in 1960 when that law was
 
04:01:39.889 --> 04:01:39.899 align:start position:0%
written Charter Schools were not did not
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
exist here in New Hampshire so the
 
04:01:43.790 --> 04:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
number of times and examples of things
 
04:01:45.349 --> 04:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
like that that are just present
 
04:01:46.849 --> 04:01:46.859 align:start position:0%
challenges on behalf of the department
 
04:01:48.950 --> 04:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
on behalf of schools could just really
 
04:01:51.530 --> 04:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
use some external partner to kind of
 
04:01:54.170 --> 04:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
look at this say you know what are we
 
04:01:55.849 --> 04:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
what is the intent what are we supposed
 
04:01:58.189 --> 04:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
to be doing maybe moving sections around
 
04:02:00.070 --> 04:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
and really just helping everybody
 
04:02:02.809 --> 04:02:02.819 align:start position:0%
be better at implementing the
 
04:02:04.490 --> 04:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
requirements of the legislature and the
 
04:02:06.110 --> 04:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
laws that you've chosen to write for an
 
04:02:06.120 --> 04:02:08.750 align:start position:0%
laws that you've chosen to write for an
education

04:02:08.750 --> 04:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:10.130 --> 04:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
so you didn't mark on here for either of
 
04:02:14.330 --> 04:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
you whether you're in favor of this bill
 
04:02:17.990 --> 04:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
or whether this is an impossible task or
 
04:02:20.150 --> 04:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
um so very infrequently do we say we're
 
04:02:21.469 --> 04:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
in favor but I will go ahead and say
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative for a question
 
04:02:32.570 --> 04:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for my
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
question so you guys have a lot of
 
04:02:35.870 --> 04:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
expertise I'm guessing there's others in
 
04:02:37.490 --> 04:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
the department with a lot of expertise
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
in these kinds of issues
 
04:02:41.809 --> 04:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
given your knowledge of that how long do
 
04:02:42.710 --> 04:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
you think it would take to actually go
 
04:02:46.370 --> 04:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
through that book and figure it out so I
 
04:02:47.689 --> 04:02:47.699 align:start position:0%
do think it is going to be a very
 
04:02:49.370 --> 04:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
challenging task
 
04:02:52.849 --> 04:02:52.859 align:start position:0%
um so with the department will we assume
 
04:02:54.110 --> 04:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
the process would be is for the
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to if this bill
 
04:02:58.250 --> 04:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
is to pass and give us an appropriation
 
04:03:01.729 --> 04:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
release an RFP to get vendors to
 
04:03:03.710 --> 04:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
potentially apply that hopefully do this
 
04:03:05.570 --> 04:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
work and kind of give give us some ideas
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
of whether we think this is something
 
04:03:08.750 --> 04:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
that could be reasonably accomplished
 
04:03:09.950 --> 04:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
with the amount of money that's being
 
04:03:12.469 --> 04:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
proposed or not and if it comes down to
 
04:03:14.330 --> 04:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
well we can only do certain sections
 
04:03:16.250 --> 04:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
then you know we'll take that and we'll
 
04:03:18.410 --> 04:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
start going through that process
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
there are a ton of education laws this
 
04:03:23.570 --> 04:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
is also a ton of Education rules that
 
04:03:26.090 --> 04:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
also will need to be reviewed so it will
 
04:03:29.210 --> 04:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
likely take quite a bit of time which is
 
04:03:30.950 --> 04:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
part of why we would like to have an
 
04:03:32.510 --> 04:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
external partner do this work rather
 
04:03:34.010 --> 04:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
than just put it on our existing
 
04:03:35.570 --> 04:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
attorneys that work at the Department of
 
04:03:38.269 --> 04:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
Education there's no feasible way that
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
Diana and our other attorneys and our
 
04:03:41.510 --> 04:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
partners at the Attorney General's
 
04:03:43.010 --> 04:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
office could accomplish this work
 
04:03:47.570 --> 04:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
without dedicating a full time to this
 
04:03:49.429 --> 04:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
work on top of all the additional work
 
04:04:00.130 --> 04:04:00.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:03.229 --> 04:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you it's pretty much a
 
04:04:04.969 --> 04:04:04.979 align:start position:0%
follow-up to representative verf's
 
04:04:04.979 --> 04:04:06.170 align:start position:0%
follow-up to representative verf's
question

04:04:06.170 --> 04:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:04:09.830 --> 04:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
um given given that you've had people
 
04:04:13.309 --> 04:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
working with that book for a while it uh
 
04:04:15.530 --> 04:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
It just strikes me that you know the 80
 
04:04:17.570 --> 04:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
20 rule may be able to come in effect
 
04:04:21.410 --> 04:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
here so if there's about 20 percent of
 
04:04:23.929 --> 04:04:23.939 align:start position:0%
the portions of the statute that are
 
04:04:27.710 --> 04:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
creating 80 percent of the problems is
 
04:04:31.070 --> 04:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
there a kind of a way to identify the
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
priorities for repair instead of saying
 
04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
this whole I I think you kind of implied
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
it in your last answer but but can that
 
04:04:43.610 --> 04:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
be done before legislation has passed to
 
04:04:46.130 --> 04:04:46.140 align:start position:0%
tell us what the priorities are so the
 
04:04:47.389 --> 04:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
problem with that is it's a really
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
inclusive project of all of the all of
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
the laws because I would say for example
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
the building law has been Rewritten Fair
 
04:04:56.090 --> 04:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
like recently and we said all right that
 
04:04:57.590 --> 04:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
makes sense so you maybe don't need to
 
04:04:59.269 --> 04:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
focus on that but then this Charter
 
04:05:02.030 --> 04:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
School issue has come to light and they
 
04:05:04.070 --> 04:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
if you we directed somebody to look at
 
04:05:05.870 --> 04:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
say just the building a law the school
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
money law or the charter school law
 
04:05:11.870 --> 04:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
you're probably not going to get a
 
04:05:13.790 --> 04:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
product that we really need at the
 
04:05:16.849 --> 04:05:16.859 align:start position:0%
department we are as individuals when
 
04:05:18.590 --> 04:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing our job are constantly
 
04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
trying to adjust the existing law I can
 
04:05:24.830 --> 04:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
give you a couple good examples so last
 
04:05:29.450 --> 04:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
year a bill passed to rewrite RSA 198 38
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
through 42 which is the law around the
 
04:05:33.050 --> 04:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
payment of the adequate education
 
04:05:36.170 --> 04:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
funding formula that funding formula law
 
04:05:39.010 --> 04:05:39.020 align:start position:0%
we had an LBA audit I believe it was in
 
04:05:42.530 --> 04:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
2013 or 14 we had proposed some
 
04:05:44.950 --> 04:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
legislation at that time to fix it
 
04:05:47.090 --> 04:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
representative Sally fellows when she
 
04:05:48.290 --> 04:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
worked at the Department of Education
 
04:05:50.510 --> 04:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
had initially drafted that legislation
 
04:05:52.490 --> 04:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
we tried several times to get that
 
04:05:54.769 --> 04:05:54.779 align:start position:0%
legislation passed and it wasn't until
 
04:05:56.689 --> 04:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
last summer where we finally were able
 
04:05:58.670 --> 04:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
to get that legislation passed to fix
 
04:06:01.370 --> 04:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
just that small section I have another
 
04:06:03.710 --> 04:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
proposal that will be heard in the
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
Senate shortly about fixing the account
 
04:06:09.290 --> 04:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
the accountability assessment law us so
 
04:06:10.610 --> 04:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
this is something that we are doing
 
04:06:13.010 --> 04:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
through our work on a regular basis at
 
04:06:15.050 --> 04:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education but we are
 
04:06:16.849 --> 04:06:16.859 align:start position:0%
really looking for a comprehensive look
 
04:06:19.429 --> 04:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
at all of all education laws
 
04:06:21.170 --> 04:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
and I will just simply add to that for
 
04:06:22.969 --> 04:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
the record Diana Fenton um an attorney
 
04:06:25.550 --> 04:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Ed this is as
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn said this is really an issue
 
04:06:28.969 --> 04:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed in in
 
04:06:31.309 --> 04:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
totality the department continually
 
04:06:33.469 --> 04:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
brings forward and identifies issues
 
04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed but that
 
04:06:38.150 --> 04:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
really is a piecemeal approach and this
 
04:06:39.769 --> 04:06:39.779 align:start position:0%
is a wonderful opportunity for someone
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
to look at this holistically and then
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
give guidance to the respective
 
04:06:46.010 --> 04:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
committees in terms of how we can better
 
04:06:47.809 --> 04:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
address the issues that are raised
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
really on a day-to-day basis as we work
 
04:06:53.330 --> 04:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
with this book um
 
04:06:59.929 --> 04:06:59.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:59.939 --> 04:07:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

04:07:01.750 --> 04:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:07:06.050 --> 04:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
it's it seems to me that you have a
 
04:07:08.830 --> 04:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
practical hurdle to cross and that is
 
04:07:11.990 --> 04:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
for whoever is ultimately the the
 
04:07:14.330 --> 04:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
project manager or the the lead subject
 
04:07:17.210 --> 04:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
matter expert they already need to know
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
the law pretty well and then that gets
 
04:07:23.570 --> 04:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
to be a fairly finite group of people I
 
04:07:26.090 --> 04:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
mean as you think imagine who might
 
04:07:28.370 --> 04:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
actually get this external contract to
 
04:07:29.630 --> 04:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
do this work
 
04:07:32.210 --> 04:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
is there is there an organization or a
 
04:07:34.370 --> 04:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
person that's already prepared to be
 
04:07:36.650 --> 04:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
efficient or or there's a bunch of the
 
04:07:39.769 --> 04:07:39.779 align:start position:0%
money just going to go to learning what
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:46.910 --> 04:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
I feel that you know most lawyers could
 
04:07:49.790 --> 04:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
could pick up this project and undertake
 
04:07:52.309 --> 04:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
it it's reading through the statutes
 
04:07:54.530 --> 04:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
it's looking at it holistically it's
 
04:07:56.210 --> 04:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
figuring out where there are conflicts
 
04:07:57.710 --> 04:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
it's figuring out where there are
 
04:08:00.110 --> 04:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
programs that are no longer necessary or
 
04:08:02.510 --> 04:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
needed one of the programs that we
 
04:08:06.670 --> 04:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
identified as RSA 193 colon 31 and it's
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
from 1985 it's uh it's education of
 
04:08:14.150 --> 04:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
missing children and that's a task that
 
04:08:17.570 --> 04:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
has now been taken on by DHHS as part of
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
their human trafficking role and so this
 
04:08:22.130 --> 04:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
is an area that while it is on the books
 
04:08:23.450 --> 04:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
and this has been mentioned in previous
 
04:08:23.460 --> 04:08:24.769 align:start position:0%
and this has been mentioned in previous
testimony

04:08:24.769 --> 04:08:24.779 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:08:27.170 --> 04:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
this is not a program that is actively
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
being engaged with another agency has
 
04:08:33.889 --> 04:08:33.899 align:start position:0%
taken it on and so I I feel confident
 
04:08:35.809 --> 04:08:35.819 align:start position:0%
that there are many lawyers who would be
 
04:08:37.729 --> 04:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
capable even without necessarily an
 
04:08:40.010 --> 04:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
educational background of reviewing
 
04:08:42.410 --> 04:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
these laws and and doing the work that
 
04:08:44.450 --> 04:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
we need them to do and identifying some
 
04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
of these areas of concern
 
04:08:48.950 --> 04:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:50.929 --> 04:08:50.939 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative
 
04:08:52.560 --> 04:08:54.170 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative
emmerich

04:08:54.170 --> 04:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
emmerich
 
04:08:57.170 --> 04:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh it it would
 
04:09:00.050 --> 04:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
seem to me in my past lives I've been
 
04:09:03.710 --> 04:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
involved in manuals where we kept a rata
 
04:09:05.870 --> 04:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
you know the oops we didn't catch that
 
04:09:08.809 --> 04:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
one uh do you have such a
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know spreadless uh Excel or anything
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
that says oops this doesn't jive with
 
04:09:17.210 --> 04:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
that I mean it would seem it would start
 
04:09:19.429 --> 04:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
to settle in to uh representative
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
Edwards point that they're probably
 
04:09:23.150 --> 04:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:09:26.510 --> 04:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
fewer areas than than we think and it
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
would seem like a waste of time to read
 
04:09:30.830 --> 04:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
the whole thing for these seven areas
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
that are a disaster for example so I
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you think it's fewer
 
04:09:37.429 --> 04:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
areas I think once we start this product
 
04:09:39.710 --> 04:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
process it's going to be much more areas
 
04:09:41.870 --> 04:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
than we had ever really anticipated
 
04:09:44.689 --> 04:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
so um it's funny because Diana and I
 
04:09:46.610 --> 04:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
were sitting yesterday in her office and
 
04:09:48.590 --> 04:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
talking about coming here to testify on
 
04:09:50.389 --> 04:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
behalf of this bill and we were both
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
just kind of like throwing areas like
 
04:09:54.050 --> 04:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
well what about this what about that we
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
don't have a formal document the
 
04:09:56.750 --> 04:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has been
 
04:09:58.550 --> 04:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
maintaining but I can tell you from
 
04:10:00.410 --> 04:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
sitting down with me and my staff and
 
04:10:02.750 --> 04:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
the administrators that know these laws
 
04:10:04.250 --> 04:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
and rules and work with them on a daily
 
04:10:06.769 --> 04:10:06.779 align:start position:0%
basis that we can come up with a pretty
 
04:10:09.469 --> 04:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
comprehensive list quickly that will
 
04:10:11.689 --> 04:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
maybe scare put some potential people
 
04:10:14.030 --> 04:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
from doing the work but
 
04:10:17.269 --> 04:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:19.490 --> 04:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
representative papavichi Miller and then
 
04:10:21.469 --> 04:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
representative Marty
 
04:10:23.389 --> 04:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:10:25.610 --> 04:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
taking the questions we've already heard
 
04:10:27.349 --> 04:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
the opinion of the Prime sponsor on the
 
04:10:29.630 --> 04:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
timeline and the budget of this If This
 
04:10:30.889 --> 04:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
Were a question asked of you without
 
04:10:33.050 --> 04:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
considering an existing law and we would
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
ask you how much time and how much money
 
04:10:37.010 --> 04:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
would be needed to perform a project
 
04:10:38.710 --> 04:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
like this what would be your rough
 
04:10:41.090 --> 04:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
estimate of both the timeline and the
 
04:10:41.100 --> 04:10:42.769 align:start position:0%
estimate of both the timeline and the
budget

04:10:42.769 --> 04:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:10:44.750 --> 04:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
um I mean honestly from the Department's
 
04:10:46.610 --> 04:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
perspective we haven't done a lot of
 
04:10:48.410 --> 04:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
research on how how much a project like
 
04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
this will cost we will like we do with
 
04:10:53.870 --> 04:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
all of our projects releasing RFP see
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
what those proposals say and those will
 
04:10:58.010 --> 04:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
come with timelines we have actually
 
04:11:00.349 --> 04:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
kind of spitballed some ideas internally
 
04:11:02.570 --> 04:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
saying that you know is this the kind of
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
some is there companies that exist that
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
do this work already on behalf of
 
04:11:08.210 --> 04:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
different laws and states and whatnot
 
04:11:11.090 --> 04:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
but we are really just in the foundation
 
04:11:12.889 --> 04:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
of starting to look at getting this work
 
04:11:14.630 --> 04:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
done so we don't have a great answer for
 
04:11:18.170 --> 04:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
that Mr Quick follow-up follow-up you
 
04:11:20.090 --> 04:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned potentially putting on an RFP
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
to get a reasonable quote what would be
 
04:11:25.250 --> 04:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
the timeline and cost for that is that
 
04:11:26.990 --> 04:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
something that could be done in time for
 
04:11:28.729 --> 04:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
us to still consider the bill and any
 
04:11:32.929 --> 04:11:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:32.939 --> 04:11:33.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:11:33.790 --> 04:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:37.790 --> 04:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
so I I don't think that we would get the
 
04:11:41.210 --> 04:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
quality of bids back or um on an RFP if
 
04:11:42.889 --> 04:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
there weren't a log requiring the
 
04:11:44.510 --> 04:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
department to do that
 
04:11:46.370 --> 04:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
um there's no there's very little cost
 
04:11:48.530 --> 04:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
associated with putting out an RFP it's
 
04:11:50.510 --> 04:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education staff and time
 
04:11:53.090 --> 04:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
that that associate with RFP but we
 
04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
typically wouldn't start that until
 
04:11:57.110 --> 04:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's at least some formal requirement
 
04:12:00.349 --> 04:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the department thank you
 
04:12:02.570 --> 04:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
representative Murray for a question
 
04:12:05.809 --> 04:12:05.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh two things
 
04:12:08.570 --> 04:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
um when you with great difficulty try to
 
04:12:10.849 --> 04:12:10.859 align:start position:0%
clean up some of these areas that have
 
04:12:13.429 --> 04:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
you know issues that you you're aware of
 
04:12:15.170 --> 04:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
what can you do to make sure that you
 
04:12:17.150 --> 04:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
haven't created an additional conflict
 
04:12:19.849 --> 04:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
with some law that's back in 1950 or
 
04:12:22.670 --> 04:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
whatever and the second question is can
 
04:12:24.530 --> 04:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
you assure us that there it seems to me
 
04:12:26.929 --> 04:12:26.939 align:start position:0%
we can't be the only ones facing this
 
04:12:30.349 --> 04:12:30.359 align:start position:0%
issue and can you assure us or give some
 
04:12:33.410 --> 04:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
information around agencies that do this
 
04:12:34.910 --> 04:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
for their living that this is their
 
04:12:37.309 --> 04:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
professional job
 
04:12:39.830 --> 04:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
so we don't have the second part of your
 
04:12:41.330 --> 04:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
question we don't have that data right
 
04:12:44.090 --> 04:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
now um because we are just in the very
 
04:12:46.490 --> 04:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
beginning of starting this process
 
04:12:47.809 --> 04:12:47.819 align:start position:0%
um I hope there are companies out there
 
04:12:49.250 --> 04:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
that do this and this is something that
 
04:12:52.010 --> 04:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
very easily just fits into existing work
 
04:12:53.389 --> 04:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
um I also do you know there's many
 
04:12:54.710 --> 04:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
attorneys in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:12:57.469 --> 04:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
that are experts in education law that
 
04:13:00.110 --> 04:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
may want to step in and do this role
 
04:13:05.330 --> 04:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
um as far as creating additional areas
 
04:13:07.610 --> 04:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
where there might be conflicts that's
 
04:13:08.929 --> 04:13:08.939 align:start position:0%
actually why we're looking for a
 
04:13:10.370 --> 04:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach rather than
 
04:13:12.050 --> 04:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
saying let's just do the building Aid
 
04:13:13.729 --> 04:13:13.739 align:start position:0%
law and now let's do the assessment law
 
04:13:16.969 --> 04:13:16.979 align:start position:0%
and these one-off pieces have we've been
 
04:13:18.530 --> 04:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
able to kind of fix our one-off pieces
 
04:13:20.330 --> 04:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
but it's the whole picture now that is
 
04:13:24.110 --> 04:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.120 --> 04:13:28.330 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:13:28.330 --> 04:13:28.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:30.710 --> 04:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:13:33.050 --> 04:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
testifying would you believe that any
 
04:13:35.150 --> 04:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
publicity from one of my bills is good
 
04:13:37.070 --> 04:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
publicity so I'm glad I could provide
 
04:13:40.070 --> 04:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
you the uh example to begin your
 
04:13:44.809 --> 04:13:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:46.490 --> 04:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
04:13:48.410 --> 04:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt
 
04:13:48.420 --> 04:13:49.250 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt
um

04:13:49.250 --> 04:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:51.530 --> 04:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that if you're going to
 
04:13:53.950 --> 04:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
examine something as as
 
04:13:57.170 --> 04:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
large as the education law
 
04:13:59.269 --> 04:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
that it's going to take more than a
 
04:14:01.550 --> 04:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer and it's going to take more than
 
04:14:03.410 --> 04:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh you know the uniform the UniFi the
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
commission on uniform state laws has
 
04:14:10.790 --> 04:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
been in the existence for 30 or 40 years
 
04:14:11.929 --> 04:14:11.939 align:start position:0%
at least
 
04:14:16.010 --> 04:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
and uh the the American Bar Association
 
04:14:20.750 --> 04:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
has come up with a number of standard
 
04:14:24.410 --> 04:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
laws including uh the Uniform Commercial
 
04:14:28.010 --> 04:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
Code and things like that uh but that's
 
04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
a major undertaking and and what we're
 
04:14:34.130 --> 04:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
talking about here is a a series of laws
 
04:14:36.170 --> 04:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
enacted at different times under
 
04:14:38.809 --> 04:14:38.819 align:start position:0%
different circumstances which are viewed
 
04:14:42.530 --> 04:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
from today's perspective have got real
 
04:14:44.870 --> 04:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
difficulties and it's not just a matter
 
04:14:48.110 --> 04:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
of one conflicts with the other one may
 
04:14:49.550 --> 04:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
conflict with one which may then
 
04:14:51.769 --> 04:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
conflict with three or four others and
 
04:14:53.630 --> 04:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
you have to have a process for
 
04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
eliminating the conflicts before you can
 
04:14:58.929 --> 04:14:58.939 align:start position:0%
decide what you want to have for a law
 
04:15:03.170 --> 04:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm suggesting that uh this
 
04:15:06.110 --> 04:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
particular statute is probably a little
 
04:15:10.189 --> 04:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
too easy going in that in those terms uh
 
04:15:13.010 --> 04:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
to be worthy of well I certainly
 
04:15:14.809 --> 04:15:14.819 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't want to stick a
 
04:15:16.429 --> 04:15:16.439 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars on it and just
 
04:15:18.050 --> 04:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
hand it to the commissioner of education
 
04:15:20.269 --> 04:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
and say I have a ball
 
04:15:21.530 --> 04:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:15:24.110 --> 04:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
and to your point um I I believe all the
 
04:15:26.150 --> 04:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
things you just said are absolutely true
 
04:15:28.849 --> 04:15:28.859 align:start position:0%
and we really need to start someplace we
 
04:15:30.290 --> 04:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
need to start this as a talking point
 
04:15:31.849 --> 04:15:31.859 align:start position:0%
for the Department to really help us
 
04:15:33.530 --> 04:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
improve our operations and that's why
 
04:15:34.910 --> 04:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
we're coming to the committee with this
 
04:15:38.030 --> 04:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
proposal and you know we would love more
 
04:15:40.969 --> 04:15:40.979 align:start position:0%
money and more time but we we've got to
 
04:15:42.769 --> 04:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
get it going because I don't want to be
 
04:15:45.290 --> 04:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
sitting here in 13 more years from now
 
04:15:50.030 --> 04:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
and saying which that might happen so
 
04:15:50.040 --> 04:15:52.309 align:start position:0%
and saying which that might happen so
mm-hmm

04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
anything further from the committee
 
04:15:57.410 --> 04:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you
 
04:15:57.420 --> 04:15:58.490 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you
thank you Mom

04:15:58.490 --> 04:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mom
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
in Romans 3 it talks about the
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
commission commissioner or designee will
 
04:16:06.590 --> 04:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
have exclusive uh supervisory Authority
 
04:16:09.650 --> 04:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
who would you who do you think should
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
um should it be the legislature or so I
 
04:16:14.689 --> 04:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
I think we're gonna
 
04:16:15.950 --> 04:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
um we actually spoke with the Attorney
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
General's office this morning and we're
 
04:16:19.490 --> 04:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
going to ask to say the Department of
 
04:16:21.290 --> 04:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
Education and consultation with the
 
04:16:23.330 --> 04:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office that's the
 
04:16:25.250 --> 04:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
language they would like and we at the
 
04:16:26.809 --> 04:16:26.819 align:start position:0%
department are fine with that and we've
 
04:16:28.370 --> 04:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
talked to representative Hill about
 
04:16:30.050 --> 04:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
potentially amending it to include that
 
04:16:31.370 --> 04:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
04:16:32.689 --> 04:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
um obviously the other thing is too is
 
04:16:33.830 --> 04:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and the department
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
can't write bills we have to ask you all
 
04:16:37.429 --> 04:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
to do that and thankfully representative
 
04:16:39.410 --> 04:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
Hill wrote this one for us
 
04:16:41.689 --> 04:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
um but in the proposal would eventually
 
04:16:44.210 --> 04:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
end up in the hands of the legislature
 
04:16:46.070 --> 04:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
um hopefully proposing and adjusting
 
04:16:47.929 --> 04:16:47.939 align:start position:0%
those bills or those laws as needed okay
 
04:16:51.050 --> 04:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:54.349 --> 04:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
anything further from committee members
 
04:16:55.790 --> 04:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:16:58.010 --> 04:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
I will close the hearing
 
04:17:01.790 --> 04:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
on Bill 468 and I will announce that all
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
these bills will be going through
 
04:17:05.809 --> 04:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
division two does representative
 
04:17:08.030 --> 04:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
emmerich want to announce any time that
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
you'll be hearing them tomorrow
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
starting at 10. and and then 212.
 
04:17:20.450 --> 04:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
all right so anybody anybody with any
 
04:17:23.570 --> 04:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
further interest these will be coming
 
04:17:26.750 --> 04:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:29.450 --> 04:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to remind division three
 
04:17:33.290 --> 04:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
that uh HP 120 is uh going to be heard
 
04:17:35.150 --> 04:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
at three o'clock down in children and
 
04:17:38.210 --> 04:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
family law and it it really helped the
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
whole process of fast tracking and if
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
everyone in division three can attend
 
04:17:46.010 --> 04:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
it looks like the blue sheet on House
 
04:17:48.229 --> 04:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 468 is blank
 
04:17:50.570 --> 04:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
so probably we've heard from everybody
 
04:17:52.309 --> 04:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
that has an interest
 
04:17:52.319 --> 04:17:53.030 align:start position:0%
that has an interest
um

04:17:53.030 --> 04:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:55.309 --> 04:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
I would
 
04:17:57.110 --> 04:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
all right division one has an
 
04:17:57.120 --> 04:17:58.490 align:start position:0%

04:18:59.330 --> 04:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
attendance thank you for your
 
04:19:02.210 --> 04:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
intelligent questions you'll see many
 
04:19:04.610 --> 04:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
areas that we'll be working on in this
 
04:19:07.729 --> 04:19:07.739 align:start position:0%
in this committee and there's lots of
 
04:19:10.189 --> 04:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
ways we can fix them it's going to take
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
all of our mental abilities to try to
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
figure out how but there's lots of ways
 
04:19:16.250 --> 04:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
like some of the things we heard today
 
04:19:18.410 --> 04:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
that we were discussing
 
04:19:18.420 --> 04:19:19.250 align:start position:0%
that we were discussing
um

04:19:19.250 --> 04:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:22.370 --> 04:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
talking about building Aid it's in a
 
04:19:23.689 --> 04:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
separate line
 
04:19:25.490 --> 04:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need to be in a separate line
 
04:19:28.670 --> 04:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
we have more money coming into the
 
04:19:28.680 --> 04:19:29.689 align:start position:0%
we have more money coming into the
um

04:19:29.689 --> 04:19:29.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:32.450 --> 04:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
adequacy then we need
 
04:19:34.490 --> 04:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
because of the decline in enrollment
 
04:19:37.010 --> 04:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
depending on how we use that money
 
04:19:40.670 --> 04:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
We could decide by law to put building
 
04:19:40.680 --> 04:19:41.990 align:start position:0%
We could decide by law to put building
Aid

04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
Aid
 
04:19:42.000 --> 04:19:43.370 align:start position:0%
Aid
under

04:19:43.370 --> 04:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:19:45.889 --> 04:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
under adequacy that's something that we
 
04:19:47.510 --> 04:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
could do here we could change the law if
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
need be to use to put that money in the
 
04:19:51.110 --> 04:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
place where it needs to be
 
04:19:53.689 --> 04:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
or we could look at the formula that
 
04:19:56.510 --> 04:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
puts money into the education trust fund
 
04:19:58.670 --> 04:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
and say too much of this is going in too
 
04:20:00.469 --> 04:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
much of that is going in and we could
 
04:20:03.790 --> 04:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
tweak the percentages that each of those
 
04:20:07.070 --> 04:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
fun sources of funds except for gambling
 
04:20:09.530 --> 04:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
money that all goes into
 
04:20:12.050 --> 04:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
education trust fund but the other
 
04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
sources are all can be variable keep
 
04:20:16.370 --> 04:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
that in mind as we go through these
 
04:20:18.769 --> 04:20:18.779 align:start position:0%
things and try to find out how do we
 
04:20:20.630 --> 04:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
best spend money on education to have it
 
04:20:22.250 --> 04:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
work the way we want it to
 
04:20:25.010 --> 04:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
and of course we welcome the director's
 
04:20:27.050 --> 04:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
comments on any of these thoughts but
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
these are some of the things that have
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
occurred to me as we're discussing all
 
04:20:32.870 --> 04:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
these bills and where the money comes
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
from and where it goes so
 
04:20:35.520 --> 04:20:37.010 align:start position:0%
from and where it goes so
be

04:20:37.010 --> 04:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
be imaginative there are more ways we
 
04:20:41.570 --> 04:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
can use this money than has been done in
 
04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
the past especially as situations change
 
04:20:46.130 --> 04:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
so I thank you all for your attendance
 
04:20:49.849 --> 04:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
and we'll see you on Thursday I think we
 
04:20:52.250 --> 04:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
start at 10 o'clock thank you all for
