18 and senate senate bill 18
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
um allows the tasting
 
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
of um distilleries to come to farmer's
 
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.030 align:start position:0%
of um distilleries to come to farmer's
markets

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
markets
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
and they limit the amount to half an
 
00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
ounce per
 
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
label per person
 
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
it just adds to the rsa
 
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
what the breweries and the
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
wineries are able to do
 
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty much targeted for
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
only uh incubator distilleries
 
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
in in the state and i think you'll hear
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
from a number of the
 
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
distilleries hopefully um i know the one
 
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
from derry
 
00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 align:start position:0%
i believe he should be on the line andy
 
00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.990 align:start position:0%
i believe he should be on the line andy
day

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
and it limits the um
 
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
distilleries to only i think
 
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
distilleries that have that um
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
have 10 000 bottles
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
so that they per year so that they can
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
um keep it an incubator process
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
and in the senate uh senate hearing
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%

everything in this bill is now the way
you

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
think it's uh appropriate uh yes we
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
we worked with uh senator birdsell to
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh craft some of the amended language or
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
the some of the language that you see
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
to limit it to small businesses that are
 
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
operating solely within the state and in
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
an attempt to make sure that this
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
is an effort to promote new hampshire
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
businesses and
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
really not become a platform for larger
 
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.550 align:start position:0%
really not become a platform for larger
uh

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
distilleries from out of state to come
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
in to
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
participate good great uh
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
representative abel has a question for
 
00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:51.990 align:start position:0%
representative abel has a question for
you

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%

review
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
for us how issues
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
like checking identification to make
 
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.069 align:start position:0%
like checking identification to make
sure

00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
someone is uh of legal age and so forth
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
how how that would be is covered in the
 
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
how how that would be is covered in the
bill

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you representative for
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
your question um
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
you can see in the language that you
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
have above
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me lines i believe 2 through
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
10 describe the the
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
process and limitations farmers markets
 
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:29.829 align:start position:0%
process and limitations farmers markets
are

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
a process that is controlled locally
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
so when a distiller is going to
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
participate whether it's a distillery or
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
a winery or a beverage manufacturer
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
they need to register and pay whatever
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
fees are going to be
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
necessary at the local level follow
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
whatever rules
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
that exist at the local level for
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
placement et cetera hours of
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
operation and then it will be incumbent
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
upon any of the licensees
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
who are participating the umbrella that
 
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.590 align:start position:0%
who are participating the umbrella that
exists

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
over this entire process is rsa1795
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
which is a statute that prohibits
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol from being
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
provided or sold to an intoxicated
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
person or to a person under
 
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
21. so any of the businesses that are
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
licensed by the commission
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
would need to adhere to that
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
statutory guideline at all times of
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
their operation
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure if that answers your
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
question sir
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative bartlett
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you for
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
coming to see us um
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
mr moore um mine is a similar question
 
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:39.750 align:start position:0%
mr moore um mine is a similar question
to

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative abel's i mean it was
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
kind of in light of
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
the hearing that we had yesterday and
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
kind of going over enforcement issues
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
made me a little bit more informed
 
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.509 align:start position:0%
made me a little bit more informed
although

00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
although
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
small small amount um again
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
if we're going back to this is a change
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
from beer and wine to hard liquor
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
um and i i see that that it's a smaller
 
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:08.790 align:start position:0%
um and i i see that that it's a smaller
amount

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
that the distillers would be able to
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
offer a half an ounce per label
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any of these small
 
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839 align:start position:0%
distilleries that have more than one
 
00:12:22.839 --> 00:12:24.870 align:start position:0%
distilleries that have more than one
label

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
label
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative i can't tell you for
 
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.470 align:start position:0%
representative i can't tell you for
certain

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
exactly uh how many distilleries have
 
00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
more than one label
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest that probably if a
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
distillery were going to participate
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
they'd probably want to bring
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
their entire line of products so if they
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
were to produce a
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
whiskey or a rum or a vodka or a gin
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
most likely they would want to be
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
bringing those products
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
along that that being said
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
i think there's uh certainly a concern
 
00:12:59.190 --> 00:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
that uh farmers markets don't end
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
turn into a happy hour where you get to
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
just kind of work your way down the line
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
and drink and drink and drink
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh the half ounce again where we look at
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
some of the sizes based upon the alcohol
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
content uh of the products
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
so a half ounce spirits rather
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
if 80 proof or made up of 40 alcohol by
 
00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.750 align:start position:0%
if 80 proof or made up of 40 alcohol by
volume

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
volume
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
and so therefore the decision to confine
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
it to a smaller amount is
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
is really to try to
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
provide the consumer with an opportunity
 
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
to taste but yet
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
it would be something that they could
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
become intoxicated on solely
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
now if if a business that's at a farmers
 
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.269 align:start position:0%
now if if a business that's at a farmers
market

00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
has multiple labels and just wants to
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
start serving them
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
most likely they're going to charge for
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
them to sample it
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
and hopefully the
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
pricing of it would be such that it
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be an encouragement for the
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
for the person to over consume and as i
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned to
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative abel governing and
 
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
overseeing this entire process would be
 
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.230 align:start position:0%
overseeing this entire process would be
rsa1795

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
rsa1795
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
which would uh make it unlawful for the
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
licensee to
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
serve a person to the point of
 
00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:18.389 align:start position:0%
serve a person to the point of
intoxication

00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
intoxication
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
ask another question for the question in
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
clara thanks very much
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
um so i've been to the maiden new
 
00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:26.470 align:start position:0%
um so i've been to the maiden new
hampshire

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
expo and is is
 
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
a mead considered a distilled product
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh no needs are kind of in a world of
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
um their
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
your committee has over the years taken
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
up many definitional changes and
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
percentages of alcohol by volume
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
so within the definition of a beverage
 
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
meat is kind of defined so it's it's
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
it certainly is an alcoholic beverage
 
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.509 align:start position:0%
it certainly is an alcoholic beverage
and

00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
based upon its classification um
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
would be eligible to be brought to a
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
farmer's market
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
for tasting right and the answer would
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
be it's be a wine
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
poor okay so that's a wine and we know
 
00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:13.670 align:start position:0%
poor okay so that's a wine and we know
that

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
moonlight meadery which i happen to like
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
very much um
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
has a lot of meads so they can have all
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
those different
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
they already can have all the different
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
tasting of all the different meads
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am subject to whatever the limit
 
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.389 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am subject to whatever the limit
on

00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
wine is and then if tamworth distillery
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
comes down
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
of course i don't know how many bottles
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
they do per year is that considered an
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
incubator distillery
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
well we would we would use that um i
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
can't tell you for exactly exactly what
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
their production is annually
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
um and i think what we'll probably do if
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
this were to become law
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
is when a business is
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
we would notify these distilleries uh
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
based upon what production levels they
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
have reported
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh if they're eligible to participate in
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
the farmers markets or not
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
okay so that would be up to the liquor
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
commission to notify
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
the distilleries we we would obviously
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
look at their figures they're the ones
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
who report to us their production
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
so we we would make sure that they knew
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
of the law change
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
probably the association is going to
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
inform the members of
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
any law change anyway but we would
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
certainly work with that industry to
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that they understand
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
what the limitations are uh on this uh
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
it should have become law
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and just so uh
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
everybody knows so a half an ounce is
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
actually a
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
third of a shot the shot is actually an
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
ounce and a half
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
so it would be you would have to take
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
three samples before you had a shot
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
but you know what martini has like three
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
in it
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
you couldn't make that taste good enough
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for uh attorney
 
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.110 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for uh attorney
moore

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
moore
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
saying none we thank you very much uh
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%

derry
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate you guys being here
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
today and hearing this
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
um senator bridzel has worked with us in
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
the past and
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
really done a lot of good things and i
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
feel like this is uh the next step
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
in um helping small business uh we would
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
be one of these uh incubator
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
distilleries uh small production and
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
just trying to get our name out there
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
some of these questions actually came up
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
in the senate hearing
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to address that we are a
 
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:08.950 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to address that we are a
business

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
and we take alcohol very seriously
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
and want people to have a safe
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
experience with it
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
we also don't want to give away
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
everything so i do have
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
probably 20 different products i would
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
probably select
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
a handful of those that i would want to
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
display at the farmer's market
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
and then very much like i do in my
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
tasting room when someone comes in and
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
says oh well
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
what do you have my question to them is
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
well what do you like
 
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
because i don't want to taste somebody
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
through everything that i have
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
i would rather narrow down their choices
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
and give them a couple of samples and
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
see what they like because at the end of
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
i want to make that sale so i will also
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
distilleries wineries and breweries tend
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
to work together collectively to make
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone has a safe experience
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to things like iding um
 
00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.350 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to things like iding um
over

00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
serving i just monitoring people's
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
alcohol intake
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
will kind of signal to each other and
 
00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:06.310 align:start position:0%
will kind of signal to each other and
communicate

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
communicate
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
you know this this person probably
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't need anything else
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
and just kind of work as a team so we're
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
we're very excited about this
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%

so we are certainly in that incubator
phase

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%

and certainly would welcome an
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to meet people at farmer's
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%

uh last session this bill this bill
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
passed the senate however it was
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
uh it wasn't included in an anonymous

bill when it went across
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
this bill was refiled at the request of
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire liquor commission
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
a key component of state revenues is the
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
profits produced
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
by the sale of of liquor this bill will
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%

directly ship liquor
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
in turn this would allow the commission
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
to add another arrow
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
in there in their equivalent to promote
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%

00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
it created an online presence
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
this this allows
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
this allows them to expand those these
 
00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.290 align:start position:0%
this allows them to expand those these
opportunities

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:00.300 align:start position:0%

uh to put uh our budget in a positive
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
in a positive mode and this gives the
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
commission another opportunity
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%

00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
representative patuck might be able to
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%

00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
is that um we have that that
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
pesky word shell in there and
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
i know that there are some small
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
retailers that might
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
be interested in and um selling these
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
products but are would a small
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh be required to um
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
apply for a direct shipper permit they
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
may have no interest in
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%

apologize for that
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
i think someone from the commission
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
might be able to address that question
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
right physically and so they're they're
 
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.470 align:start position:0%
right physically and so they're they're
there

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
aren't they representative that's guy
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
attorney morrison available so uh uh

representing western u.s
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
are you referring to representative
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
lang's amendment that we got was floated
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
around yes i am and maybe i was
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
premature in asking the question
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
so the senator might be totally unaware
 
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
that that that amendment is floating
 
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.029 align:start position:0%
that that that amendment is floating
around

00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay i understand thank you oh so but um
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
just so you know
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
attorney uh senator um what the
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
what it is is uh reference to um
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
that allowing in-state beverage
 
00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:16.230 align:start position:0%
that allowing in-state beverage
manufacturers

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh or wineries or and soldiers to be
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
able to direct ship
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
currently uh the only people who can
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
direct ship uh
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire is from out of state
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
and that is what the
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment is about so it's
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
it is a definitely totally different
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
issue is that what you wanted to talk
 
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:35.990 align:start position:0%
issue is that what you wanted to talk
about

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
between uh john mentioned yes mr
 
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:39.669 align:start position:0%

did he go to legislative services and
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%

00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh yes it was distributed um
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
the emails about it but i didn't know
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%

in this and other jurisdictions and as
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
the senator mentioned
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
excuse me this this bill is very
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
important to the commission
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
as we try to maintain our
 
00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:28.310 align:start position:0%
as we try to maintain our
competitiveness

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
competitiveness
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
with other states to give us the
 
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.950 align:start position:0%
with other states to give us the
opportunity

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
as the markets open across the country
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
to register as a direct shipper
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
in other states and to pursue the
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
ship into those states from new
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire as well as the ability
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
to work within the state of new
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire and serve customer needs
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of products that the
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
commission sells
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
and to possibly ship those working with
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire manufacturers to
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
develop a strategy that would
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
make delivery an important part of what
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
the commission does in the way of
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to take any questions
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
underlying bill representative if you
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
if there are any okay um
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
i do not s there's any questions on the
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
um and i i i'm not sure that you have
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
seen this amendment then i assume
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
i i have seen a draft of something
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
floating around
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
if that is in fact what the amendment is
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
i can probably give you some information
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
on it if you'd like
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh the language of yeah just
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
adding including in the state of new
 
00:30:52.159 --> 00:30:52.950 align:start position:0%
adding including in the state of new
hampshire

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
uh so who is eligible to take advantage
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
of the direct shipping
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
license um
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
procedurally sir does that need to be as
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
it has it been officially introduced yet
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
evidently it just did now now
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
i would say that uh um
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
normally if something like this you know
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
i i the chair would have to rule on
 
00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:17.029 align:start position:0%
i i the chair would have to rule on
tremaineness

00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
tremaineness
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
and and then decide whether that
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh we would need to hold a separate
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
hearing on germainus or not
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
at this moment i'm i'm going to hold off
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
on making that decision
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
so because i just need to uh know
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
understand the consequences
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
of adding this this in because it is
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
direct shipping
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
so it is the direct shipping statute so
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
it's certainly germaine enough in terms
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
of the actual rsa
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the intent the
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
difference between between
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
a licensee and that this
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
underlying bill is just the commission
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
but so i guess uh how do you
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about uh in-state
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
producers being able to direct ship to
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you sir for your question um
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
the the if if i understand the amendment
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
which would uh amend
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
rsa 178 colon 27
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
adding in the phrase including the state
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
as you know mr chairman and for the
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
member benefit of the committee members
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
who are not around
 
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
at that time direct shipping was created
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
with largely with the legislation
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
introduced by representative hunt
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
to allow businesses
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
located outside of the state of new
 
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.310 align:start position:0%
located outside of the state of new
hampshire

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
to register with the state of new
 
00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.870 align:start position:0%
to register with the state of new
hampshire

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
and to ship their products into the
 
00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:44.789 align:start position:0%
and to ship their products into the
state

00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
to consumers uh who wish to purchase
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
products that might not be available
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
within the state
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh that has been uh in place for some
 
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.149 align:start position:0%
uh that has been uh in place for some
time

00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
and the change that's
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
that is being proposed would now
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
appear to extend
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
the direct shipper permit
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
process to every licensee
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
who is licensed within the state of new
 
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
it speaks to um including the state of
 
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.389 align:start position:0%
it speaks to um including the state of
excu

00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
excu
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
let me if i could just step back for
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
just a moment
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to kind of parse through
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
the words here with you a bit
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any other provision of
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
law to the contrary any person currently
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
licensed in its state of domicile
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
including the state of new hampshire as
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
a wine manufacturer
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer importer
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
wholesaler or retailer may apply for a
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
direct shipper permit from the
 
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.389 align:start position:0%
direct shipper permit from the
commission

00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's pretty broad and it looks like
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
everybody except a rectifier to me
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
well it's it it doesn't it doesn't have
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
rec it doesn't have rectifiers
 
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
right it doesn't have nano brewers
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
um it speaks to
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
terms such as the use of the word
 
00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:08.869 align:start position:0%
terms such as the use of the word
importer

00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
importer
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
the word importer does not appear in
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
title 13.
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
it presents a challenge to
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
us if this were to pass as written
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
to determine an importer is someone who
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
is licensed maybe in
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state uh facility
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
or the state of the business rather
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
wholesalers are we speaking about
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire wholesalers because if so then
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
i think they would need to be referred
 
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:38.869 align:start position:0%
i think they would need to be referred
to

00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh properly as as to who they are
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
within our statutes so that they be can
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
businesses within the direct direct
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
shipper fee
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me direct shippers statute if you
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
are a wine manufacturer within the state
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
and you want to do this you're going to
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
have to pay a fee of 100
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
because that's what's in the statute
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's what the fee is for wine
 
00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:10.790 align:start position:0%
that's what the fee is for wine
manufacturers

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
if you're an importer or a retailer
 
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
and retailers are not defined either
 
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.430 align:start position:0%
and retailers are not defined either
because

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
we i think we all presume we know what a
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
retailer is but for the purposes of
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
interpreting the statute and applying
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
the statute we would probably want
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
additional clarity as to
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
who would be in that class under the
 
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.510 align:start position:0%
who would be in that class under the
current

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
fee requirements a retailer
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
now that could be on premise could be
 
00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:38.630 align:start position:0%
now that could be on premise could be
off-premise

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
off-premise
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
we don't really know it could be
 
00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:42.150 align:start position:0%
we don't really know it could be
restaurants

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
could be anybody they would have to pay
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
a fee of five hundred dollars
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
to obtain this uh and as as
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
why would their fee be higher that's
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
just the fee schedule that the
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
legislature has
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
put in place in in for the direct
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
shipping in other words
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
the way i read this is that you're
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
getting a direct shipping license
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
over and above whatever license you
 
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
already have correct
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
right now the direct license we don't we
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
don't vary that that license fee based
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
upon the type of
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
this is this is this is the fee these
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
are the fees that are applied
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
to businesses who apply for direct
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
shippers permit to ship
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
into the state by including this
 
00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:28.150 align:start position:0%
into the state by including this
language

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
and by making in my opinion by making
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
this statutory provision applicable to
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
in-state businesses
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
you don't relieve them of the fee
 
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.150 align:start position:0%
you don't relieve them of the fee
requirements

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
you essentially expose them to the fee
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
requirements right
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
you also expose them to the limitations
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
on the quantities that they can ship
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
and go ahead sir i'm sorry that's fine
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
um so by including them here
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
it certainly can be done it could i was
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
i would think it would need further
 
00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:11.030 align:start position:0%
i would think it would need further
clarification

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
within the definition of eligibility for
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
178.27 so that the commission could
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
clearly um i'm not sure mr chairman if
 
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.069 align:start position:0%
clearly um i'm not sure mr chairman if
it's

00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate at this time to mention that
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
there is another bill
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
um senate bill 125 which has yet to
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
appear before your committee
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
in which this issue is addressed from a
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
product from a perspective
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
of intra state shipment a separate and
 
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.550 align:start position:0%
of intra state shipment a separate and
distinct

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
distinct
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
approach to the shipment
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
of alcohol within the state
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
by new hampshire licensees so
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
we have that 125 is is also a direct
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
shipping bill
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
also it has a piece of that heard a lot
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
of stories about 125 so i don't know
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
what's in it
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
it has it has a piece of that in it a
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
piece in it okay and
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
and within that um there would be no
 
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.510 align:start position:0%
and within that um there would be no
charge

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
for licensure current licensee for a
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
current license in new hampshire
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
to obtain a direct shipment so so you're
 
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
suggesting that
 
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
that um maybe this amendment the problem
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
with this amendment is that there's
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
gonna be an action
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
added fee to it but that if uh in 125
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
um everyone would still be able does
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
that include rectifiers and nanos and
 
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.910 align:start position:0%
that include rectifiers and nanos and
125

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
125
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
it does not um it would again
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
subject to whoever drafted the amendment
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
if you're looking for the broadest
 
00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:46.310 align:start position:0%
if you're looking for the broadest
possible

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
application then i think the eligibility
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
pieces in both this bill uh senate bill
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
14 as amended
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
with rsa 178 27
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
and the other senate bill 125 would also
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
examined to make sure that the
 
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.589 align:start position:0%
examined to make sure that the
definitions

00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
were broad enough to include the class
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
of licensees that you would like to see
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate okay
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
all right well the good news is we have
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to figure that out before
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
this bill has these bills have to be out
 
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:22.790 align:start position:0%
this bill has these bills have to be out
of

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
committee we do have a couple of hands
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
up um
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
we'll start uh with uh
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative weston thank you mr chair
 
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.710 align:start position:0%
representative weston thank you mr chair
um

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to mention that when uh mr
 
00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.069 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to mention that when uh mr
moore

00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
moore
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
uh read the amendment he did say
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
that the he did use the word may
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
apply for a direct ship or permit but
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment does say
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
shell which in my mind
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
means that they would be required to do
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
it whether they needed to or not
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
so i know there's a lot of problems here
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
and that it sounds like we'll be
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
working on this anyway but i was just
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
curious that
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
that the way it was read was different
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
from what i have on my
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
clearly the shall the child must be in
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
the statue that that's
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
chow was already in the statute um
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
and i think that it it was
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
really is someone who wrote this bill
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
wrote the lie
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
i would say is the show was saying that
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to ship into new hampshire
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
that was what the challenge meant not
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
that you had to get a license
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
whether you wanted to or not it says
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
only if you wanted to
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
ship into the state of new hampshire
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's what that shell means
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you but i agree with you that
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
it obviously we would not want to
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
force someone to get a license they
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
don't want better pay for it
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative herbert um thank you
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt um all i'm interested in
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
is some direction as to number one
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
uh how much time and then what are we
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
going to do in order to get a finished
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
product uh uh successfully
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh made i don't have any clue
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
i i mean obviously there's sounded like
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
a half a dozen to a dozen
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh things that uh attorney
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
moore uh pointed out as problematic
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
so um and we have another bill
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
which is senate bill and i'm i'm i'm
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
basically very confused so i
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it if the chairman uh
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt could uh kind of lay out a
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
road map
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh as to how we're going to uh
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
well obviously i originally had hoped to
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
have senate bill 125 today but
 
00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.069 align:start position:0%
have senate bill 125 today but
unfortunately

00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
it didn't didn't get to us so yet
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
so um and for whatever reason so i don't
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
know if it was
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know what was the issues going on in
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
the senate just did the senate when did
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
senate bill 125 actually pass the senate
 
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.589 align:start position:0%
senate bill 125 actually pass the senate
yet

00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
turn anymore i believe it has sir okay
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
so um but we'll schedule that hearing
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
and then basically
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know we'll um i i as much as i
 
00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to do subcommittees per se um
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
i guess we would uh you know need to do
 
00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:30.230 align:start position:0%
i guess we would uh you know need to do
a

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
straw poll see how everybody feels i
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
would assume that
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
everyone here is okay with allowing new
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of the direct shipping
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
laws unless if somebody thinks
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
differently then you know i think you
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
you know that that uh
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
they'll need to voice that opinion um
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
but that you know that we all would want
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
them to be able to take advantage of the
 
00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:51.589 align:start position:0%
them to be able to take advantage of the
law

00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh and as long as it's affordable
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
enforceable and done
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
right uh and i'm sure they would like to
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
do it without an extra fee
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
so um if that's what's in senator 125
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
that sounds like that might be
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
the way where it will end up going but
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh in either case we'll have
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
we'll have both these bills to discuss
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
um but in terms of when uh
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
everything has to be out of out of the
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
committee our deadline is may 27th
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
so we literally have practically the
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
whole month of may to
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
to figure these things out so
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman this is aiden i was
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if i could ask you a
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
procedural question
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
certainly where the
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
amendment uh introduced by
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative tusic
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
is now part of senate
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
and certainly certainly the underlying
 
00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.150 align:start position:0%
and certainly certainly the underlying
bill

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
is very important to the commission
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure uh if you feel
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
another they need to remain together
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
just about voices in the background here
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know where that's coming from
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay i would say in my personal opinion
 
00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:22.710 align:start position:0%
okay i would say in my personal opinion
um

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
if that if drag shipping is in senate
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
bill 125
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
my preference would be to take it up in
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
that way i don't have to decide whether
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
there's germain or not
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
okay in terms of the issue um clearly
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh this this bill is a direct shipping
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
bill but
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
it was a it's a bill that is directly
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
just at
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
the uh commission and not licensee so i
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
see representative lang would like to
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
probably weigh
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
in here so um i would say on the face of
 
00:44:51.119 --> 00:44:51.589 align:start position:0%
in here so um i would say on the face of
it

00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
um we would work with them together but
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
um i could if we can get it worked out
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
in senate bill 125
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
then that would be a good thing um i
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
just know that there are some
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
people have had concerns about 25 so i
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
would be concerned
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
with some of the other issues that are
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
in that bill and whether that would
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
also baggage this you know that this
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
issue would not
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
happen if it was in that bill so in that
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
case um then i would want
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
this issue to be in senate bill 14. so i
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
guess we i
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
i want to wait to we do 125 and see
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
where we are with that bill
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
um for now i'll let representative lang
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
testify and then unless
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
unless you have a specific question to
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
me or or
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
you have a question for me yes um just
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
to clarify the answer that you gave
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
aidan at this point the two are separate
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the bill are not
 
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.230 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the bill are not
married

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
married
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment needs to be accepted
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
before it becomes a part of it so there
 
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:43.990 align:start position:0%
before it becomes a part of it so there
is

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill is still clean as
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
far as amendments go am i correct
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
that is correct thank you okay
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
representative lange
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
committee i apologize for being late i
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
was running a little behind this morning
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you for letting me testify
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
again i i brought this amendment um work
 
00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:00.710 align:start position:0%
again i i brought this amendment um work
with

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative um because again i i was
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
felt it was important that new hampshire
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
breweries and and
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
liquor distributors licensees be uh on
 
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.270 align:start position:0%
liquor distributors licensees be uh on
par

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
par
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
with out of state they should not be you
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
know hindered
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh what out of state people can do and
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
and in writing it in this
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
met way one of the things that's
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
happening now
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
is that again the liquor commission and
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
the attorneys
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
have to align the definitions that are
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
in this with our new hampshire
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
statutes to make sure that the licensee
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
in the other state
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
qualifies under these definitions are
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
there a wine manufacturer beverage
 
00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.390 align:start position:0%
there a wine manufacturer beverage
manufacturer

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i'll note that the title of uh
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
senate bill 125
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
is relative to beverage manufacturers so
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
they're already making those
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
determinations as to what licensees fall
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
into what categories
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
um again this is a parity bill it just
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
brings new hampshire
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
businesses in parity with out of
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
businesses we should not be hobbling or
 
00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.390 align:start position:0%
businesses we should not be hobbling or
hindering

00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
hindering
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
our in-state businesses and giving
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
preference to out-of-state businesses
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
um and that is it i will say that 125
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
does have
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
a whole lot more to do with you know
 
00:47:08.839 --> 00:47:10.550 align:start position:0%
a whole lot more to do with you know
defining

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
defining
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer licenses
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
quantities of alcohol that they produce
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
and there's a whole lot more
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
rather than a direct conversation around
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
do we want to allow
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh alcohol licensees to be able to
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
direct ship with inter
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
interstate interest state rather than uh
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
just interstate
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
um and they should be able my opinion is
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
they should be allowed to capture new
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire market as well as any out of
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
state market
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh through the direct direct shipping
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
model and
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
um and i hope the committee would adopt
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
and uh and and move the bill forward
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
even if it's flawed with that shell
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
being misinterpreted
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
well again i i if i if i understood the
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
conversation to shall
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
is that if they want to participate in
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
direct shipping
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh they shall obtain a license and the
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
license fee is a hundred dollars it
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
sounded like
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
and and i'm okay with that be honest
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
with you i mean if if if you
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
want to further amendments bill to to
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
take that uh
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
if it's a new hampshire licensee has
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
already paid for a licensee
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh for a license that they the fee
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
can be waived i'm completely okay with
 
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:18.790 align:start position:0%
can be waived i'm completely okay with
that

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
um but again the idea is right now they
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
can't even participate
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
um in a meaningful way okay so
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
we have two different issues one is we
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know we want them to be able to do
 
00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:29.990 align:start position:0%
you know we want them to be able to do
this

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
okay and the question is to be able to
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
is it what is the best way to do this so
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
we go look at their
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
statute and their license and put it in
 
00:48:39.839 --> 00:48:41.109 align:start position:0%
statute and their license and put it in
there

00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
versus putting it in this section which
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
would mean they would have to pay an
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
extra fee
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
so my take would be is they would
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
probably not want to be in the statute
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
if we could put it somewhere else so
 
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
that they would not have to pay an extra
 
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:55.430 align:start position:0%
that they would not have to pay an extra
fee

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
fee
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure that because the
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
purpose of the fee
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
is the administrative costs of the
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
direct shipping program
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
which one of the things we heard
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday was that lba
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
thinks the commission is dropping the
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
ball uh because they haven't figured out
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
how to make sure
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
that there's no illegal shipments into
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
the state and that people are doing
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
everything properly so
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
there might be some question that the
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
fee is not enough so this is open for
 
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.710 align:start position:0%
fee is not enough so this is open for
discussion

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
either way going that way but i would
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
tell you representative lang
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
before you get you know so pushing this
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
language about why
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know they only a fairness issue um i
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
introdu i
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
sponsored this bill over 20 years ago 20
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
years ago okay and no one
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
no one in the state of new hampshire is
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
ever come up to me and say gee we really
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to direct ship
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
inside the state and the reason being is
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
is that the consumer
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
is now going to have to pay an 8 tax
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
so i would think that most consumers
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
would probably try it if
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
not no santa covered obviously code
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
changed everything where we weren't
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
shopping anywhere but the idea that um
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know we don't even have a bottle
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
bill in the state the idea that now
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
you're gonna charge
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
eight percent for that for that very
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
exclusive whatever product you're buying
 
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:15.829 align:start position:0%
exclusive whatever product you're buying
beer

00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
beer
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
i i always thought was a um
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
a a deterrent from wanting to do
 
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:22.710 align:start position:0%
a a deterrent from wanting to do
business

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
that way and that if the product is made
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it certainly should be
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
available to buy an answer
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
without an eight percent tax added to it
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
i fully agree mr chairman and and again
 
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.190 align:start position:0%
i fully agree mr chairman and and again
i

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh part of this was brought to me by the
 
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
industry itself so they're at least
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
wanting the option and this is the
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
chapter they were
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
they they brought to me and said did you
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
look at this and then i went around and
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
asked around at some of the uh
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
i have a brewery right in my in my
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
community and i went to them and chatted
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
um and they were they were okay with
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
that so again
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
i would tell you that the industry
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
itself is the ones that brought this
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
forward because at least they want the
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
option that they don't have right now
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
and they're willing to pay for that
 
00:50:59.200 --> 00:50:59.829 align:start position:0%
and they're willing to pay for that
option

00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
fair enough okay
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative lang
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
okay see man thank you very much uh
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me representative mcclaire you
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
you very chris oh no okay not all right
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%

uh okay so i have seen no hands up and
 
00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.950 align:start position:0%
uh okay so i have seen no hands up and
attendees

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
attendees
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
no panelists okay so i guess we've
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
fully discussed this issue um
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
and we have four people in support no
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to senate bill 14.
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
and with that oh well i do have a hand
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
and you just have to unmute yourself and
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%

well yes we can perfect
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh good morning mr chairman members of
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is kevin
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
daigle and i am the vice president of
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire grocers association
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
representing convenience stores
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
supermarkets here in the state of new
 
00:52:21.839 --> 00:52:23.109 align:start position:0%
supermarkets here in the state of new
hampshire

00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
i'll start by saying we have not seen
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
and we were not planning to speak to the
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
but do want to speak to the amendment
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
which does not appear to be related to
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
as you guys have discussed well we might
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
understand the desire for parity across
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
all licensees the broadening of the
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
statute could very likely have some
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
including direct impacts and economic
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
consequences for our retailers
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
and a significant disruption of new
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire's long-standing three-tiered
 
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.230 align:start position:0%
hampshire's long-standing three-tiered
system

00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
a system we fully support and believes
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
works well um
 
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
we're not comfortable making this change
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
until it can be thoroughly vetted
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
but that's something it says you guys
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
are looking at doing
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
um and we'd urge the committee at this
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
stage to defer any action on the
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
amendment until there's a better
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
understanding of its intent
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
ramifications thank you
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
um so kevin i'm glad you're here um
 
00:53:20.079 --> 00:53:20.630 align:start position:0%
um so kevin i'm glad you're here um
because

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
my my question to you is um
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
given covet i i've been using instant
 
00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.270 align:start position:0%
given covet i i've been using instant
cart

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
cart
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
for doing my grocery shopping and i know
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
that both
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
hannaford and market baskets are listed
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
there um
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
and don't don't can i buy beer through
 
00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:37.589 align:start position:0%
and don't don't can i buy beer through
my

00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
instacart and from from a grocer i
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
believe you can
 
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
um it's part of their um license as
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
is um so they just need to be able to
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
have that license with them if they're
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
doing to home delivery
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
or whatnot and then making sure the
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
delivery driver is a certain age
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
okay so uh and obviously they can do
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
that without the eight percent tax
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
do you really think an eight percent tax
 
00:54:01.839 --> 00:54:02.230 align:start position:0%
do you really think an eight percent tax
uh

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
is going to hurt you economically when
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
someone is going to buy it
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
i guess directly from the manufacturer
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
the beverage manufacturer
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh why why would they want to pay an
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
eight percent tax when they can buy it
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
for you for
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
with no tax right well i i agree i mean
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
they should be buying it
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
for us um not seeing the amendment um
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
the war the language that we had seen
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
tossed around
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
included everybody i mean so this would
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
also allow distributors to
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
sell direct to a consumer
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh distributors have always had that
 
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.829 align:start position:0%
uh distributors have always had that
right

00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact i was remembering
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
the old days
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
when whenever i wanted you know for
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
college when i don't want to get a keg
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
you the place to get the keg was going
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
directly to the distributor
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
distributors have always had the right
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
to to sell now whether they direct ship
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
no they probably be more than welcome to
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
deliver it right to your door
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
exactly and and they would have that
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
right to do that so they
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
they don't even need the shipping
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
because they can deliver it to you

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to get back in and you're
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not showing up
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh well we don't see your smiling face
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's true but we see
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
you and you got a square so you just
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
have to turn on your video if done
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
might be maybe not because
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
didn't well that's right you had it it
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
was the internet i just moved him in
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
so he should be able because he was an
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
attendee again he was an attendee again
 
00:55:59.599 --> 00:56:00.069 align:start position:0%
attendee again he was an attendee again
right

00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
but i saw him on my screen here but i
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
don't know when you allow him to
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
talk when he's allowed to talk as an
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
attendee he shows up on the screen but
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
he's still an attendee so now he's a
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
panelist you know just when i thought i
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
had this thing down to us
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's tricky okay
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
okay there you are beautiful you can see
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%

00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%

bartzel state senator for district 19
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
which encompasses the towns of derry
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%

00:58:06.839 --> 00:58:08.150 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to introduce senate bill
17.

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
17.
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
i'm the prime sponsor and it's relative
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
to brew pubs allowing customers to bring
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
dogs to the outdoor areas and enabling
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
um and the second part is enabling nano
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
breweries and brew pubs to enter into
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
contracts with contract brewers
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
i will speak to the first part and i
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
think senator sherman is on
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
he um in on
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
paragraph the new paragraph two he will
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
probably speak
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
to because that's his um his amendment
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
that we added to my bill
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
so uh basically what the
 
00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
prime bill was to allow um with the
 
00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:46.630 align:start position:0%
prime bill was to allow um with the
municipalities

00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
um adoption of an ordinance allowing
 
00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.309 align:start position:0%
um adoption of an ordinance allowing
brew

00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
brew
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
allowing person to hold brew pub license
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
it allows the brew pubs to have
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
their customers bring their um
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
dogs to the brew pubs but only in the
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
outdoor patio
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
areas i believe this passed the senate
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
last year and i think it might have
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
passed the house but i can't remember
 
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:12.470 align:start position:0%
passed the house but i can't remember
but

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
again it got lost in the senator
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
patricia because i mean
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
representative petrucci saying no so i
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
definitely passed the hou
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
the senate and um i think it got lost in
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
the omnibus bills last year so
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's my portion in a nutshell
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
so uh this issue has passed the house uh
 
00:59:34.079 --> 00:59:34.390 align:start position:0%
so uh this issue has passed the house uh
uh

00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
in past years not okay and it did pass
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
um but it wasn't limited to just uh
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
brewpubs it was open to all restaurants
 
00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
that have outside
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
outdoor seating and the issue was that
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
we definitely don't want the dogs
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
indoors because that could be
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
with uh um dogs that are or have a
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
or have a mission and um so that it
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
would only be
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
outdoors and but it was so can you
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
address why you're doing brew pubs and
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
not all restaurants that have outdoor
 
01:00:06.079 --> 01:00:07.030 align:start position:0%
not all restaurants that have outdoor
seating

01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
seating
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
well it does have um it does amend 466
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
and i um and i looked at 466 colon 44
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
and it looks like it does a restaurants
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
do allow them on the patios but it may
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
just be the owner's
 
01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:29.030 align:start position:0%
dog from what i was um was reading
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:33.670 align:start position:0%
dog from what i was um was reading
[Laughter]

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
i'd be open to amendment allowing but um
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
i wanted to start um with a small bite
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the apple with brew pubs
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
okay well take a little little step
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
small paw babies yes puppy paws
 
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes okay uh do we have any questions for
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative burrissell yes
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question um
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
senator was one of the motivations for
 
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.309 align:start position:0%
senator was one of the motivations for
this

01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
um bill on in terms of the dogs
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
to actually increase business because
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of people traveling with
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
their dogs now and going out to eat so
 
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
it would actually
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
benefit the um these establishments
 
01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.870 align:start position:0%
benefit the um these establishments
financially

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
financially
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
that was that was a piece of it but the
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
prime reason was i actually had some
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
brew pubs come to me and they had lost
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
customers because hhs came in and told
 
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
them they couldn't have the dogs on the
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
patios so
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
some of the brew pubs did come to me and
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
asked me to
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
change the or add this to the rsas to
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
allow that so that they can
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
um their customers can bring their their
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh dogs
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative um i assume that
 
01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.230 align:start position:0%
okay representative um i assume that
this

01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
means the dog must be on the leash is
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
that written into the uh
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
law i believe um that would be a local
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
ordinance and i think it
 
01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
i've actually been reading some of the
 
01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:04.870 align:start position:0%
i've actually been reading some of the
uh

01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
comments on some of our community pages
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's actually a state law
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
that dogs have to be on leashes
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair well you're right
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard this before
 
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
um and some of the issues that that i
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
have with this
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
mirror what the dhhs sent out to us
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
with um objections such as um you can't
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
control where a dog defecates or
 
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.670 align:start position:0%
control where a dog defecates or
irritates

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
irritates
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's out on a patio who cleans
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
it up
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's you know nothing that that
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
presents this um would the staff of the
 
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:45.589 align:start position:0%
presents this um would the staff of the
restaurant

01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
be responsible how would other customers
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
a dog that was aggressive um
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
would there be would the owner of the
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
business have the ability to
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
deny a customer that was there
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
with a dog if there was a problem with
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
that dog
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
would they be liable if they
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
determined that the dog was aggressive
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
or not behaved was
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
a affecting other dogs that could be
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
in the area i mean there's there's a lot
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
of other questions that are not
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
addressed in this bill
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i i my own opinion is that
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
there are um
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
public safety and sanitary issues
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
when you have dogs around food and i
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
just don't think that the
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
that i mean how how does this bill
 
01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:46.870 align:start position:0%
that i mean how how does this bill
address

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your your uh comments and
 
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
your question and i i think
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
what would happen is and it it
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
i mean if you go to portsmouth they'll
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
they allow dogs on the on the patios i
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
think it would be a local ordinance
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
that if the town or the city
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
wants to add that um that capability to
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
allow their brew problems
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
and it's really up to the brew pubs to
 
01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:17.430 align:start position:0%
and it's really up to the brew pubs to
address

01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
go to the town the selectmen or the um
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
council and say we this is what we'd
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
like to do and then
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
they need to work out an ordinance that
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you i was just gonna ask a
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
little bit of something along the same
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
line as to how we can
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
make some of these issues go away a
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
little bit i i personally own
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
the cutest little puppy she's adorable
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
and sweet but she
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
um she's a pain in the butt and so i
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
would not want to subject
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
someone having a nice hamburger on a
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
nice sunny day
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
and a beer uh to to her cuteness
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
and and yet i do respect the idea that
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
pet owners
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
with pandemic puppies and such are out
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
there and are looking for ways to
 
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
incorporate their pets and their social
 
01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.270 align:start position:0%
incorporate their pets and their social
lives

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
lives
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit more so i guess my question
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
is are you aware of any means by which
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
facilitate localities coming up with
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
ways to make it easier for nano brewers
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
to have these
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
pup these these pet possibilities
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question and i i
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
have to agree i mean i have
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
a 11 month old standard poodle puppy and
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
at this point i would not bring her to a
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
brewery i would not even bring her
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
to home depot at this point until she
 
01:05:39.599 --> 01:05:40.470 align:start position:0%
to home depot at this point until she
gets

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
gets
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
she gets a little bit more trained but
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
again i think it's really
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
the agreement between the nano breweries
 
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.390 align:start position:0%
the agreement between the nano breweries
and

01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
nano breweries slash restaurants however
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
brew pubs um for them to do
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
to for them to negotiate
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh a standard for their locale
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
with the town uh council or the
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
i realize this is a difficult question
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
yeah the statue of the bill uh
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
specifically says a municipality may
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
adopt an ordinance so
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
so obviously the municipality will weigh
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
in and it does
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
i was looking at just uh having advising
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
patrons that dogs are allowed on the
 
01:06:29.599 --> 01:06:30.950 align:start position:0%
patrons that dogs are allowed on the
premise

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
premise
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
in other states in colorado the one i'm
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
thinking of in particular where
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have their dogs outside
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
um the sign
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
the scientists says well-behaved dogs
 
01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:41.270 align:start position:0%
the scientists says well-behaved dogs
are

01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
permitted exactly that's why mine won't
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
go anywhere near one
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
so i i assume that uh municipalities
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
have given the authority to the owner to
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
address the issue and for someone who
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
lives in a summer community who
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
requires everyone to pick up after their
 
01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.349 align:start position:0%
requires everyone to pick up after their
dog

01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
dog
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
and we're pretty well equipped to handle
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
what they leave behind so
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
members for
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
the senator seeing them we thank you
 
01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.109 align:start position:0%

thank you okay so uh next
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
up is another senator
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
who also has an amendment onto this bill
 
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:27.280 align:start position:0%

01:07:48.079 --> 01:07:49.190 align:start position:0%
district 24 which is 11 towns on the
seacoast

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
seacoast
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
with multiple brew pubs and
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
i just want to thank senator bertsel for
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
working with me to allow me to attach
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
to the to her bill
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
essentially this amendment affects
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
two different levels of breweries nano
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
brews and brew pubs
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
you i'm sure are aware mr chair
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
the idea of adding contract brewers to
 
01:08:16.239 --> 01:08:16.709 align:start position:0%
the idea of adding contract brewers to
our

01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
repertoire in new hampshire is something
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
that occurred a few years ago
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
and when i talked to the beverage
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
association and
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
others they said it seems like it was a
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
little bit of an
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
oversight not to include nano breweries
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
and brew pubs
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
but be that as it may in my district
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
there is a brew pub called wim brewery
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
and they approached me as they were
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
looking to expand their capacity
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
but the cost of the overhead locally
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
would have been prohibitive
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
they could not do tenant brewing which
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
is allowed
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
just from a logistics standpoint and the
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
overhead that would be involved in that
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
however they were able to find sorry tom
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about the difference
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
between tenant and contract
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
so people are sure good question yeah so
 
01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.349 align:start position:0%
so people are sure good question yeah so
uh

01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not super expert on this but i will
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
do my best
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
tenant brewing is contract booing is
 
01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:17.510 align:start position:0%
tenant brewing is contract booing is
where

01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
you give your recipe to add a
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
operating large brewer and
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
they will actually brew to your recipe
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
and your specifications on contract
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
tenant brewing is where you go into a
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
similar facility
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
that has more capacity but you bring in
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
your own people your own you're
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
basically using their equipment
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
so currently tenant brewing is allowed
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
for nano pubs
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
and brew pubs but
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
it again as you can imagine it requires
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
a significant
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
investment in overhead and personnel to
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
so what contract brewing would allow
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
in both of these is say you have
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
a barrel a month production which is not
 
01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.070 align:start position:0%
a barrel a month production which is not
much

01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
you have a very popular recipe and you
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
increase your capacity you're basically
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
testing the waters you're thinking about
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
a future investment
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
it's much less expensive to do this
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
through a contract brewer where
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
they will actually create your recipe
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
at your specification the amounts you
 
01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.990 align:start position:0%
at your specification the amounts you
want

01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
and then you bring it back and sell it
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
at your brewery
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
or at your brew pub that way if it takes
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
off then
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
number one you have some funds to
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
reinvest locally
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
into your brewpub or nanobrew and number
 
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:52.550 align:start position:0%
into your brewpub or nanobrew and number
two

01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know that some of the risk
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
is less because it actually is
 
01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.790 align:start position:0%
is less because it actually is
successful

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
the other benefits of the concept of
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
allowing contract brewing staying
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
completely within the limits that are
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
already imposed on nano brews and brew
 
01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.310 align:start position:0%
already imposed on nano brews and brew
pubs

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
pubs
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
is that the nano brew and brew pub
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
as i said will be able to expand
 
01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.030 align:start position:0%
as i said will be able to expand
capacity

01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
without a huge financial risk the
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
contract brewers
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
like it because they typically will put
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
you in in places where they have
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
gaps in production so it's not
 
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
that you're competing with their current
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
production times
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that they they are
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
able to fill out their um
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
there are times when the when the
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
brewery is not
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
actually producing and they can fill in
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
those gaps
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
the third is that the customers have
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
more accessibility to your product and
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
the fourth
 
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
of course is that the state sees the
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
increased revenue
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
of increased production um
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
so the bill is or the the amendment is
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
fairly simple
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
it uh allowed the the biggest hurdle
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
in working with the liquor commission
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
was how do we know if somebody is
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
starting from scratch
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
how do we know what the production
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
levels are and we wanted to be sure that
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
we stuck with the spirit
 
01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
of brew pubs and mana brews which is
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
that you're brewing on site
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
so two of the requirements you'll see in
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
the in the
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
amendment are number one they have to
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
continue to brew on site
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
and it has to be at the level they were
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
brewing on site
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
prior to on an annualized basis
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
prior to contract brewing second of all
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
if they're starting from scratch you
 
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
just can't do it you have to establish
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
your level of production and it has to
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
be at least
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
10 barrels per year which isn't a lot
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
but it it would allow pretty much
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
every nano brew or brew pub that wanted
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
to contract brew it would allow them
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
that capacity
 
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
and certainly wim brewery which has a
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
very tiny facility in hampton
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
would be able to meet that that
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
that hurdle of 10 per year
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
again it respects the spirit
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
of brew pubs and nanopubs where you have
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
on-site brewing
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
it respects the current limits to
 
01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.590 align:start position:0%
it respects the current limits to
production

01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
production
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
these small businesses without
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
putting them at enormous financial risk
 
01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:45.990 align:start position:0%
putting them at enormous financial risk
and

01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if whim will be testifying
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
today i hope they will but
 
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
their estimate just to get up to uh
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
a fraction of what they can do with
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
contract brewing was going to be a 350
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
to 500 000
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
outlay in capital so that was a big
 
01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.470 align:start position:0%
outlay in capital so that was a big
concern

01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh for uh for a small operation um
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
so with that i will stop my testimony
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
and happy to take any questions you
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
might have okay
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh we do have some questions
 
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
oops thank you mr chair um
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
um senator sherman um now i
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
i i had asked um senator bernstein
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
bertsell about um this being an enabling
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
um bill and and she answered that you
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
know that's what the intent
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
is here and so we're getting into a lot
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
of detail about the difference you know
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
between a nano brewery and
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
who can do this but my concern really is
 
01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.390 align:start position:0%
who can do this but my concern really is
about

01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
promoting um the ability to bring dogs
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
onto a eating establishment premise
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
senator sherman is just here for the for
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
this piece with
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
the dogs we're that's for side for the
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
moment but he's
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
he's here for discussing just this
 
01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.229 align:start position:0%
he's here for discussing just this
contract

01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
brewing for brew pups
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
but this is the amendment to the dogs
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh in the senate's mind this is a now an
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
omnibus spill that has multiple
 
01:15:28.159 --> 01:15:29.350 align:start position:0%
omnibus spill that has multiple
questions

01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
oh boy i got lost there along the way
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
um so i'm not seeing the amendment and i
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
looked in my emails
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
this is in the bill this is actually in
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's part two of the bill they said the
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
senate well
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
yes actually section three of the bill
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
so it's uh so yeah so they they
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
will get buckle your seatbelts we're
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to see a little more of this when
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
we see senate bills that there are going
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
to be multiple
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
issues in in thank you very much
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
no problem representative
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
weston yes thank you mr chair and thank
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
you senator sherman for bringing this
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
i i did sort of zero in on the
 
01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.310 align:start position:0%
i i did sort of zero in on the
production

01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
production
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
levels when i was reading this uh
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
because being somebody who's not in the
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
business uh i was curious about the
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
the limits the lowest limit and the
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
highest limit
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
and i noticed that the difference
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
between the
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
um the brew pro pubs and the nano brewer
 
01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
were different and i'm wondering
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
if um the the
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
brew pubs are allowed to produce more
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
than the nano brewery and i wonder if
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
you could tell me why that is
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh i would love to except that we didn't
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
change that
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
that uh that's existing statute the the
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
limits of production are
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
um perhaps the chairman will remember
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
well i would say i would clarify that
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
even though the title of the bill
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
does say nano this section of the bill
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
only talks about brew pub
 
01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
no i actually i'm sorry it actually does
 
01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:11.910 align:start position:0%
no i actually i'm sorry it actually does
address

01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
both nano breweries and brew pubs
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
neither of them right
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
neither of them had the capacity to
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
contract brood
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
and so the concept is that
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
nano brews and brew pubs
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
are very similar in structure they
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
actually are sitting different
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
you know very close to each other in
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
statute but they both have the same
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
concerns is that
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
you know they are typically very small
 
01:17:42.239 --> 01:17:43.110 align:start position:0%
you know they are typically very small
operations

01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
operations
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
with limits on production
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
but being able to put in the investment
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
to expand
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
is is a combination of risk and
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
finding the capital and so the ability
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
to contract brew
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
allows them to test the waters at a
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
lower overhead they both currently as
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you know mr chair they have
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
similar structure and statute in that
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
they can both
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
tenant brew they can locally brew and
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
all this does
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
is for both of them it gives them the
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
because they both face the same hurdle
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i see it now it's so
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
this section two of the bill is nano
 
01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:30.709 align:start position:0%
this section two of the bill is nano
section

01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
three section three is proof
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
what really begs the question then you
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
know bruh
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
you're taking two statutes who were
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
born how would i say this is uh
 
01:18:45.199 --> 01:18:46.630 align:start position:0%
born how would i say this is uh
awkwardly

01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
awkwardly
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
from uh what we had which was a beverage
 
01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.270 align:start position:0%
from uh what we had which was a beverage
manufacturer

01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
and the brew hub was a cute idea that
 
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:54.470 align:start position:0%
and the brew hub was a cute idea that
that

01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
someone who was really going to make
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
that big investment to put in the big
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
tanks and everything
 
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
because they thought people would like
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
to watch it being made and watch that
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
whole process
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
and you're saying well yeah that's why
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
we have that license but they really
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that they
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
they just want to make a barrel a day
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
there and the rest of it's going to be
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
okay i guess they don't feel so bad
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
given that prove ups pay the
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
highest license they pay a cocktail
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
beverage license
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
all right uh so that for that privilege
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
but when you start throwing in nano
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
nano the license is slow the fees low
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
the volume was low because it was
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to be where you were
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
experimenting and trying out something
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
new but to go and
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
do it somewhere else it it defeats the
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of what the nano was
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to be about
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
just understood so uh i am not
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
wedded to nanos because that's not
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
the constituency that brought this
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
forward nano were nano people involved
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
in that in this or how did this get into
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
the bill then
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
no it was there because uh
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
in discussing this with
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers and others and
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
the association
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
share the same concern about as they
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
want to expand as their recipes are
 
01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.270 align:start position:0%
want to expand as their recipes are
popular

01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
popular
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
again it is you know these are small
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
operations and the ability to either get
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
capital or raise capital
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to expand is limited so
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
i absolutely hear what you're saying um
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
if you'll notice on the brewpub side
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
it was very intentional the work i did
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
and working with the chair of the liquor
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
commission to be sure that we
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
kept the spirit of the brew pubs which
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
was the focus of this the nano which is
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
that you have to have on-site brewing it
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
has to be at least at the level you were
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
doing before
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
and um and and you can't do it
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
unless you start out and demonstrate the
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
ability to do
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
a certain level of on-site brewing
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
so i think that's all in keeping with
 
01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
the brew pub the nano brew was added on
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
as uh at the request of others
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
um if you wanted to jettison that
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know i wouldn't uh
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
be seriously wounded they'll be back
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill they'll be back
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
next year so
 
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
right but but i think the on the brewpub
 
01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.550 align:start position:0%
right but but i think the on the brewpub
side

01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely we did everything we possibly
 
01:21:39.679 --> 01:21:40.229 align:start position:0%
absolutely we did everything we possibly
could

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
to keep the spirit of a brewpub alive
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know if if they stop on-site brewing
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
there's no reason they shouldn't
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
go for a production license and a
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant license
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's what they're doing you
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
know they're doing production off-site
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
then they're doing a restaurant but a
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
again as you know it is a significant
 
01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.229 align:start position:0%
again as you know it is a significant
financial

01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
risk to expand and this would be a way
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
that to happen to the benefit of pretty
 
01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:13.430 align:start position:0%
that to happen to the benefit of pretty
much

01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
all parties including the customer the
 
01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.350 align:start position:0%
all parties including the customer the
state

01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
the contract brewers and the brew pubs
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
without and i
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it violates the spirit
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
of a brewpub i think it really does meet
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
that spirit
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
i don't want to get in a running debate
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
but as you know the brew pub
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
is the poster trial of throwing the
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
three-tier system into the trash can
 
01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
and the whole running concept was
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
that they are absolutely making an
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
investment into all those tanks and all
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
that production right there
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
on site to say you said well you pass
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
this then that will help them out
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
no i i can visualize they'll start
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
pulling those tanks out and say we don't
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
we can use that space for more tables
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
more customers so because we're brewing
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
the stuff off-site
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
so maybe we maybe need a new name for
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
it's not really a brew pub it's you know
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's somebody who is a
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
is an outlet of some brewing
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturing that's going on somewhere
 
01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:14.950 align:start position:0%
manufacturing that's going on somewhere
else

01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
location well just to answer that
 
01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:18.629 align:start position:0%
location well just to answer that
concern

01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
they do have they can't pull that out
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
and continue production on site at the
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
same level they were doing it before
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
they just came a month one barrel a
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
month is nothing
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
right but what i know home brewers to do
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
more than that
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
but but what i'm saying is that they
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
have a certain
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
on-site investment uh and
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
that on-site investment they have to
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
continue at at least that level or they
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
have to change their license they can't
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
do it
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
unless they continue that and that's in
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment that but
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make the question if you
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
became a new brewpub number somebody
 
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
opening up a brew pub after this law is
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
passed they can have
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
have this minimum standard of one barrel
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
a month
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
and and be doing it off-site and so it
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
just seems to stretch to call it a brew
 
01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:04.870 align:start position:0%
just seems to stretch to call it a brew
pub

01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
pub
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
when when you have to go looking for the
 
01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:07.990 align:start position:0%
when when you have to go looking for the
tanks

01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
tanks
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
i mean most brew pubs the tanks are
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
right there they're these big you know
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
silos missiles that are parked right
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
inside there you're taking them out
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
so anyway i i get it i get it
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
senator chairman it's not that i'm
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill i just it just it's
 
01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.510 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill i just it just it's
just

01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a wonder okay
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative abel has a question
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes this is a a procedural question
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
really for the chair
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
i think um i just want to
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
clarify for myself and for everyone else
 
01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.709 align:start position:0%
clarify for myself and for everyone else
about

01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh is there a word germaness
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know uh but uh it sound
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
if a bill comes to us uh
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
from the senate and it has different
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
parts but
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
they're not what the house would
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
generally consider to be germaine
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
we can accept that but if we
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
want if we want to make
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
an amend introduce an amendment
 
01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:11.110 align:start position:0%
an amend introduce an amendment
ourselves

01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
do we have to divide the bill into two
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
bills so that we're
 
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
germaine with the one part or do we just
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
go go go forward um because we're
 
01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:24.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with two different issues here
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
so how how do we
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
how do we handle that um well clearly
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
the house and senate have different
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
rules about germanius
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
and um in the house we we require that
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
if it's a non-german amendment it has to
 
01:25:35.679 --> 01:25:36.070 align:start position:0%
if it's a non-german amendment it has to
be

01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
hold a separate public hearing but uh
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
and that's true for everything except um
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 which is allowed to be
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
chock full of anything and everything
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
um we the senate uh uh has
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
in historically and in in overwhelmingly
 
01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:52.790 align:start position:0%
in historically and in in overwhelmingly
the

01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
session uh have uh have put added bills
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
to each other and
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
and and they have decided again to do it
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
again this year and that's their choice
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
and if they send the bill over
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
we we take the bill as is in whatever
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
pieces whatever sections we want
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
and we're free to add our own sections
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
and we're removing sections and then
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
we'll take it up in the committee a
 
01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.270 align:start position:0%
we'll take it up in the committee a
conference

01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
and at that point the committee
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
conference has to has to deal with only
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
those things that are in
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
those two different versions they cannot
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
introduce a new
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment at that point
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you very much thank
 
01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.629 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you very much thank
you

01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
and let's see i do have let me see where
 
01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:43.590 align:start position:0%
and let's see i do have let me see where
my

01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
yeah did you say you want something else
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
say something no i'll get you all set

okay
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
let's see where i have who was going to
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
um so if someone else signed up to speak
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
would just raise their hand
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
so i can find okay all right henry value
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:15.110 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:16.830 align:start position:0%

association
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
and we would just ask if the committee
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
is going to move this bill forward
 
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
that you expand the bill to include
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
all restaurants the house commerce
 
01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:46.470 align:start position:0%
all restaurants the house commerce
committee

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
last session uh passed house bill 1438
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
came out of your committee uh it went to
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
it passed the house and it was sent to
 
01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
and then covert came along and the bill
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
just went
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
anywhere it was laid on the table and uh
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
the session ended so it
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
it never made it all the way to the
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
finish line
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh but uh this committee did pass
 
01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh the bill last year to allow
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
basically allow dogs in outdoor dining
 
01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:20.149 align:start position:0%
basically allow dogs in outdoor dining
areas

01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
at restaurants so it would expand it
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
beyond what this bill
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
is looking to do which is just the brew
 
01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.470 align:start position:0%
is looking to do which is just the brew
pubs

01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
pubs
 
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
and that's it okay
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
and i would just add mr chairman that i
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
sent a copy of house bill 1483 as passed
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
by the house
 
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
and senate bill 450 is passed by the
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
senate last year
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
to all the committee members a little
 
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
while ago so you can
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
they are very different 450 is identical
 
01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:50.470 align:start position:0%
they are very different 450 is identical
to

01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
the first section of senate bill 17
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
but that was part of the confusion i
 
01:28:56.719 --> 01:28:57.430 align:start position:0%
but that was part of the confusion i
think

01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%

robert levine i'm one of the owners of
 
01:29:36.159 --> 01:29:36.629 align:start position:0%
robert levine i'm one of the owners of
the

01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
wim craft pub and brewery
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
in hampton new hampshire
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
we're the ones that have the really
 
01:29:44.239 --> 01:29:46.629 align:start position:0%
we're the ones that have the really
small

01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
brewing facilities it allows us to brew
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
basically one barrel a month um
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
we would like to expand um
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
finding the financing to equip us to a
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
seven-barrel brewery which is
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
what had been in our business plan which
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
would satisfy
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
our brewing requirements would require
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
an additional investment of 350 000
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
at a minimum just the equipment alone is
 
01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:16.790 align:start position:0%
at a minimum just the equipment alone is
150

01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
150
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
000 never mind the expansion of space
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
while we can tenant brew under the
 
01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.910 align:start position:0%
while we can tenant brew under the
statute

01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
tenant brewing is a long-term commitment
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
business commitment with an established
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
requires uh federal registration
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
and approval uh in in
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
in more financial risk as senator
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
sherman explained
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
it we would go in and utilize the
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
facilities with our own personnel
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's a much more intensive
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
commitment uh
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
in business risk for us contract brewing
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh which beverage manufacturers can do
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
and these are the people with the big
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
equipment anyway
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
um allows us to go in
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
to a beverage manufacturer on a one-off
 
01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.149 align:start position:0%
to a beverage manufacturer on a one-off
basis

01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
um it our capital investment
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
is for example uh with uh
 
01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
we've contracted with great north um to
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
do this and then found out that we
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed to under the statute
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
according to liquor commission
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
after we sent in the contract for
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
approval um
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
that would cost us ten thousand dollars
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
and that would get us a 20 barrel
 
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
run of probably one of our best recipes
 
01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
and in that way we could test the market
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
see how uh brewing on that production
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
level is received
 
01:31:47.890 --> 01:31:47.900 align:start position:0%
without having to
 
01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:49.590 align:start position:0%
without having to
[Music]

01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
make a much more intensive investment
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's a one-off deal
 
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
if it works out we like the way that
 
01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
production with our recipe then we could
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
continue to do
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
so without
 
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
the financial risk
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
it levels the playing field a little bit
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
in order to enjoy some of those benefits
 
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
without the additional cost
 
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
in no way shape or form would we ever
 
01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.149 align:start position:0%
in no way shape or form would we ever
consider

01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
removing our brewing equipment on site
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
that this is our business model we could
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
have chosen to be a restaurant
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
we didn't we chose to be a brewpub
 
01:32:39.189 --> 01:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
one of my partners is a brewer and
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%

we hear you great excellent thank you
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
i did send an email to the committee so
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
i will try to keep this brief because
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh folks have at least scanned
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
it um
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
i want to make it clear i like brew pubs
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
nana brews i support it i look forward
 
01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:46.950 align:start position:0%
nana brews i support it i look forward
to

01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
getting back into it uh once we're able
 
01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.149 align:start position:0%
getting back into it uh once we're able
to

01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
um and i think it's it's a real shame
 
01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:53.510 align:start position:0%
um and i think it's it's a real shame
that

01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
this very wise granting of contractual
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility is entangled with
 
01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
a a possibly more contentious issue
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
which is the issue of dogs in outdoor
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
dining areas now
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
the issue of the sanitary uh concerns
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
and the hhs objections
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
that that's a well-worn path i think
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
it's totally valid but i'm not going to
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
bother to repeat it here i want to make
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
some points
 
01:34:17.669 --> 01:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
that are i think also valid and i also
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
want to uh
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so let me just get on with that um
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
plenty of people who want to allow dogs
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
in the outdoor eating and drinking areas
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
i totally get that and i get that that
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
people in favor of this are going to be
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
very vocal and very enthusiastic there's
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
also a significant
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
constituency of us who do not want this
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
but i think the problem is that many of
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
us who don't want it are
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
aware of the status quo comfortable with
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
the status quo and not aware that there
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
might be change on the horizon so what
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
i'm saying is that i think opposing
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
voices are underrepresented because a
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
lot of people are simply not aware of it
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
um and representative van van houten um
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
with with apologies if i mispronounce
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
your last name i think
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
you're you brought a nice perspective to
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
this saying i have a dog i love my dog
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't bring my dog to a pub and i
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
definitely um
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate that i think we a lot of us
 
01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:10.229 align:start position:0%
appreciate that i think we a lot of us
have

01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
anecdotal experience of of maybe one dog
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
in an eating area especially if
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's a service dog very very highly
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
trained doing a job
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
causing absolutely no problems
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
whatsoever i think
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
we need to look into our collective
 
01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
crystal ball
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
and think about a scenario with multiple
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
untrained non-service dogs that are in
 
01:35:31.119 --> 01:35:31.350 align:start position:0%
untrained non-service dogs that are in
an

01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
eating area surrounded by unfamiliar
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
people surrounded by unfamiliar dogs
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
with the noise with the smell of food
 
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:36.390 align:start position:0%
with the noise with the smell of food
with

01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
the people in charge of these dogs
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
drinking alcohol and ask ourselves
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
is this not a recipe for conflict
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
and disturbance i think it's just common
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
sense that there could be a lot of
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
problems and i want to point out
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
based on some of the discussion earlier
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
in this session new hampshire does not
 
01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:53.350 align:start position:0%
in this session new hampshire does not
have

01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
a leash law if you read the statute very
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
carefully the new hampshire state law
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
says a dog simply must be under
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
control which is widely interpreted by
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
many people to be
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
voice control so expand the crystal ball
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
here to a bunch of
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
unleashed dogs because that's what this
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
legislation would do
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
and let's ask ourselves the question do
 
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:14.870 align:start position:0%
and let's ask ourselves the question do
do

01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of pub managers and do a lot of
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
local police departments
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
really want to be getting involved in
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
what i and
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
what i think are the guaranteed
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
conflicts and the guaranteed problems
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
that are going to happen
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
especially when assertions about
 
01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
increased revenue increased business
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
are right no guarantee
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
to give a quick anecdotal example i was
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
on the outdoor dining patio at the
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
whaleback ski area in enfield just this
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
past weekend
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
and there was a group at a table next to
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
me with a dog
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
on a leash i went back to my car to
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
change out of my ski boots and as soon
 
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
as i came back to my table
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
their dog on its leash was sitting there
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
and nuzzling through my backpack trying
 
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
to eat my snacks
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
and the response to them was oh you
 
01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
should kick the dog
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
when it does that and my response was i
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
will not kick a dog
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
ever it's cruel and it's not my job to
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
keep your dog out of my backpack so
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
anecdotal story i don't want to get hung
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
up on it i don't want to move on to
 
01:37:08.229 --> 01:37:08.239 align:start position:0%
reasons that don't have to do with
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
whether a person likes dogs or doesn't
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
like dogs
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
so please please think of these as
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
objectively as possible when there's a
 
01:37:14.159 --> 01:37:15.270 align:start position:0%
objectively as possible when there's a
pandemic

01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
like now and like unfortunately there
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
probably will be in the future
 
01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:21.679 align:start position:0%
people who don't want to eat around dogs
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
do not
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
really have a feasible choice to simply
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
go inside
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
and eat or drink without the dogs around
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
and even if we did is it correct that
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
one group of people
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
should be empowered to displace another
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
group of people for no good reason
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
i think it's worth recognizing that dogs
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
are extremely popular no doubt
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
but the best statistics i've found which
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
by the way were sponsored by pet food
 
01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
companies and pet accessory companies
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
still find that dogs are owned by a
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
minority of u.s households now
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
being in a minority doesn't make
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
somebody wrong and being in a majority
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't make somebody right but the
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
point is
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
a large constituency should not be
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
displaced by another constituency for
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
what appears to be no good reason
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's also true that we don't
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
have a lot of outdoor pub space
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
or outdoor restaurant space in the state
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and i think all
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
citizens deserve to be comfortable using
 
01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:13.350 align:start position:0%
citizens deserve to be comfortable using
them

01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
i think it's feasible for people with
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
dogs to enjoy a pub without their dogs
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
but it's not feasible for some people to
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
enjoy a pub when there are other dogs
 
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.270 align:start position:0%
enjoy a pub when there are other dogs
around

01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
allergies are a real thing uh fears and
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
phobias are real things
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
and i think overall it's just
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's just a shame that these two issues
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
the contractual issue and the dog issue
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
are bound up together and the dog
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
issue itself i think is far too
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
loosey-goosey when you consider that we
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't actually have a statewide leash
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
law what the proposal here is to
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
open up outdoor areas to dogs and then
 
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
let the towns retroactively make
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and policy to address these
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
problems after they've happened
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
that seems very short-sighted i think if
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
dogs are going to be allowed in outdoor
 
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:56.950 align:start position:0%
dogs are going to be allowed in outdoor
spaces

01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
spaces
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
then the parameters to make it
 
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
successful need to be laid out ahead of
 
01:39:00.159 --> 01:39:00.870 align:start position:0%
successful need to be laid out ahead of
time

01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
and i do think they should be laid out
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
by the state because i have
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
experience at the town level of people
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
saying look we're not comfortable
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
making ordinances ordinances that go
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
beyond the state standard
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
i think it would be best if there was
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
some way to separate the very wise
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
business portion of the bill the
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
contractual portion from the societal
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
aspect about whether or not
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
people want to or should be able to
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
drink and eat around dogs
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's possible for the
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
bill to be split up i don't know if it's
 
01:39:31.510 --> 01:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
possible for something like dog friendly
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
dining to be restricted to a certain
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
number of days per month so that each
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
constituency can get what they want or
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
something like that but right now
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
this looks like it's far too vague far
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
too open-ended it doesn't have any
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
specificity to it to set it up for
 
01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.669 align:start position:0%
specificity to it to set it up for
success

01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
success
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
and there's a large number of people who
 
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
are opposed to it
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
many of them are unaware and that's why
 
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
they're not being heard thank you for
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%

and i'm here to provide some background
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
information regarding the current
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
regulations around the allowance of dogs
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
and food establishments
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
so as alluded to previously rsa 466
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
prohibits bringing animals into any
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant or retail store that sells
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
food except under two conditions
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
service animals or a restaurant owner's
 
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:46.709 align:start position:0%
service animals or a restaurant owner's
own

01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
properly disciplined dog is is allowed
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
in non-food preparation areas pro
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
provided there's proper
 
01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
notification to patrons that there is a
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
dog on premises
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
our food code which we've adopted into
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
our administrative rules
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
does not allow companion dogs on
 
01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:06.229 align:start position:0%
does not allow companion dogs on
premises

01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
premises
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
and food establishments and there are
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
several public health reasons that
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
should be considered before
 
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
approving expansion of this law to allow
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
for unlimited dogs
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
amount of dogs to be present in a food
 
01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:18.229 align:start position:0%
amount of dogs to be present in a food
establishment

01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
we are concerned that patrons or
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
restaurant staff may pet or other
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise handle the dogs contaminating
 
01:41:25.350 --> 01:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
their hands without
 
01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
washing them and then going on to
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
prepare food or handle tableware for
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
other patrons
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
the that the dogs may contaminate the
 
01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
chairs with their saliva
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
or from dander or fur which
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
could also be an allergen to that may
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
affect other patrons
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
and then also that dogs may have
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
accidents that could contaminate
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
the dining areas and there's no
 
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
provisions about
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
protocols or procedures for who would be
 
01:41:51.679 --> 01:41:52.790 align:start position:0%
protocols or procedures for who would be
responsible

01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
and and what would be necessary for for
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
proper cleanup
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
should that happen i would be happy to
 
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you have
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh we do have a question representative
 
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
bartlett thanks very much mr chair
 
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming to see us again
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
as always um
 
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
miss smith um one of the things i'm
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
wondering is
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
is there any provision for um whether a
 
01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:22.149 align:start position:0%
is there any provision for um whether a
patron

01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
patron
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
if the if this kind of a bill were to be
 
01:42:24.719 --> 01:42:25.510 align:start position:0%
if the if this kind of a bill were to be
passed

01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
whether the patron would have to um
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
carry insurance what if this dog
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
were to bite someone or another dog
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
is there anything in this that currently
 
01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:41.030 align:start position:0%
is there anything in this that currently
that

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
that would require the well would make
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
the restaurant owner liable for one
 
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:46.709 align:start position:0%
the restaurant owner liable for one
thing

01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
or keep the owner of the dog liable
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
um with insurance
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
so i i am not aware that the bill
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
addresses those two aspects you raise
 
01:42:58.159 --> 01:42:58.470 align:start position:0%
addresses those two aspects you raise
for

01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
two very good points um those wouldn't
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
be specifically addressed in our food
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
safety rules but but i
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
think you raised two points that
 
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
should be also under consideration
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
so do you have rules related now to
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
dogs i mean like i know we have the the
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
pub the the you know
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
but the bed breakfast statue where we
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
allow dogs do
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
did you guys ever generate rules along
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
some of these issues
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
so the only allowances currently are
 
01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:32.950 align:start position:0%
so the only allowances currently are
around

01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
the um the specific carve-outs related
 
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
to to service animals and then also that
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
the restaurant owner
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
there aren't specific rules within those
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
um it's it's just covered within the
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
statute that they're
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
that they're limited i think what we we
 
01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:48.390 align:start position:0%
that they're limited i think what we we
hear

01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
hear
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
often is that folks you know even though
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
there is rules and
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
um a statute in place around this issue
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:43:57.669 --> 01:43:57.679 align:start position:0%
consumers still bring their dogs to
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
places we we deal with many many
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
um several a month with regard to this
 
01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
issue not only restaurants but into
 
01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:05.990 align:start position:0%
issue not only restaurants but into
retail

01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
retail
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
committee members

so you know we thank you very much for
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%

uh and last but not least is aiden moore
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i'm really here
 
01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
to see if there are any
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
technical questions that the committee
 
01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
members might have and if not
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
i thank you for the opportunity to be
 
01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:37.830 align:start position:0%
i thank you for the opportunity to be
here

01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
so otherwise you're okay with the
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
language in the
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
three sections of the bill well we
 
01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:46.149 align:start position:0%
three sections of the bill well we
participated

01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
participated
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
as senator sherman indicated in working
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
through some of the
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
issues dealing with the contract brewing
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
pieces so while
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to the dog questions uh
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly happy
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
to suggest that our our cooperation with
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
the senator was
 
01:45:10.229 --> 01:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
part of what was brought to you in his
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
portion of the amendment
 
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay great and you're willing to take
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
questions i hope i'm certainly happy to
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
take some
 
01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett has a question
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for sticking around mr
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
moore um
 
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many of these very very
 
01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.830 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many of these very very
small

01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
brew breweries that there are um i think
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
come up with bills that only apply to
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
one or two businesses
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
do you in your experience know whether
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
there are there is a need for this bill
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
because there are many of these one
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
barrel a month
 
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
breweries uh
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative uh i i believe you
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
heard from the uh owner of the
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh brewpub that they are and i believe
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
they are the smallest
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
manufacturing uh brewpub
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
brewing capacity is probably the
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
smallest so
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't pretend to suggest i know
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
whether it's needed
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
or not um i think
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
senator sherman gave you compelling
 
01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:30.870 align:start position:0%
senator sherman gave you compelling
information

01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
about the business aspects of why they
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
want to do that
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
and i think representative hunt
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
probably gave you a lot of good
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
political questions about brew pubs and
 
01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:48.790 align:start position:0%
political questions about brew pubs and
nanobrewers

01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
nanobrewers
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
as far as what they were put in place
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
and intended to do so i would probably
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
suggest that
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
we really don't have a position on
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's a good idea or not
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
and would certainly defer to the to the
 
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
committee to determine
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's an appropriate concept to
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
further question vanquier thanks very
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
much um can you tell us
 
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
how many of these very very small um
 
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
brew breweries are in new hampshire
 
01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
well when you say small representative
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
are you speaking about
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
nanobrewers alone or are you speaking
 
01:47:23.679 --> 01:47:24.709 align:start position:0%
nanobrewers alone or are you speaking
about

01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
i can get you statistics and numbers of
 
01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:29.189 align:start position:0%
i can get you statistics and numbers of
the

01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
different categories of manufacturers so
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
we have a beverage manufacturer which is
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
a class of license
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
on its own we have brewpubs which again
 
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
are another type of license
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
and we have nanobrewers and i'd be happy
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
to provide you with the exact number of
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
those businesses
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
i can't give it to you right now but i'd
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
be happy to get that to you today
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
i think that would be helpful like an
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
idea of how many of these very very
 
01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:56.470 align:start position:0%
idea of how many of these very very
small

01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
um breweries there are in new hampshire
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'll make sure you have that today
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
representative thanks very much
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you for
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh maybe this is more appropriate as a
 
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
question for the chair but i think the
 
01:48:18.629 --> 01:48:18.639 align:start position:0%
title is
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
relative to brew pubs allowing customers
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
to bring door
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
dogs into outdoor areas and
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
enabling nano breweries to brew pub
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
and brew pubs to enter into contracts
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
with contract brewers it
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
seems like um this is two
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
completely different bills i wonder if
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to divide the question
 
01:48:39.119 --> 01:48:39.830 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to divide the question
ourselves

01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
the way we would be allowed to on the
 
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
floor uh
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
we are perfectly allowed to do whatever
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
anything send it send it out as two
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
bills we could add more things
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
well now we can't send two bills because
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
then you would have to have another bill
 
01:48:55.679 --> 01:48:56.310 align:start position:0%
then you would have to have another bill
so

01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
you can divide the question like you say
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
on the house floor and vote for one
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
issue and not the other
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
um but otherwise uh we can
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
delete section two of the bill and you
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
know say we don't want to put nanos in
 
01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:08.149 align:start position:0%
know say we don't want to put nanos in
here

01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
we can do anything like with that but
 
01:49:12.149 --> 01:49:12.159 align:start position:0%
you can't create a separate bill you
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
would you can
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
you can you can add and subtract
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
amendments to it
 
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying this i guess it's
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
foregone conclusion the second part of
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have any problems but this
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
first part about dogs in outdoor areas
 
01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:27.669 align:start position:0%
first part about dogs in outdoor areas
could

01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the second part of the bill
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm wondering if we can divide
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
the question in committee
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
if you think it's that's important
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
enough we could
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
certainly uh delete that
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
section of the bill but then and then
 
01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
and then go stick it on a different one
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
for instance we could take section one
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
out of this bill and go
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
throw it in senate bill 125 when it
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
comes to us
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
you know we can we can move things
 
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
around like that but um

provide some relief
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
and what we would like to suggest for
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
the committee's consideration
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
where we would not oppose the bill of
 
01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:49.430 align:start position:0%
where we would not oppose the bill of
three

01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
changes could be made and the first
 
01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
you know given that we're trying to
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
replicate the dine-in
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
experience to go we would recommend that
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
the volumes of alcohol
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
that would be allowed for to go under
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
this new license category
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
should be reduced you know from from its
 
01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:11.430 align:start position:0%
should be reduced you know from from its
current

01:55:11.430 --> 01:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
19 12 ounce beverages or
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
one and a half liters of wine to
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
something that is more comparable to
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
that dine-in experience the second is
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
as it was amended in the senate it has a
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
two-year sunset provision and we would
 
01:55:30.159 --> 01:55:30.870 align:start position:0%
two-year sunset provision and we would
request

01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
that that be reduced to one year
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
and believe that there's adequate time
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
evaluate the utility and necessity of
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
this license category going forward
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
and along those same lines we would
 
01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.270 align:start position:0%
and along those same lines we would
request

01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh that the new licensees
 
01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
under this category would be able to
 
01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:55.350 align:start position:0%
under this category would be able to
report

01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know at some timely basis
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know the the beverages and wine
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
volumes that were sold
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
with the meals to go uh to be able to
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
determine whether
 
01:56:10.709 --> 01:56:10.719 align:start position:0%
this is truly necessary and
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
of value uh for this category as
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
the uh uh i with the idea of evaluating
 
01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
this trial
 
01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh an experiment going forward
 
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
um with that i'd be open to any
 
01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:29.430 align:start position:0%

01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
okay mike i'm promoting you up good
 
01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:05.910 align:start position:0%
okay mike i'm promoting you up good
morning

01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman hunt members of
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh record my name is mike summers i'm
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
the president ceo of the future lodging
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
and restaurant association
 
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
and just to give a little context um
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
this bill that most of the majority of
 
01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
this bill was actually filed in the
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
early part of the 2020 session uh
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
senator french had filed this bill on
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
our behalf we were pursuing this
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
as something the industry would like to
 
01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
try obviously then covet hit and
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
everything kind of went sideways on us
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
the industry etc
 
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
and uh the governor was kind enough to
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
adopt this under an emergency order
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
which has allowed the industry
 
01:57:43.030 --> 01:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
to essentially experiment with this for
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
the you know for the last year
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
so uh we're here testifying in support
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
of uh senate bill 66
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
certainly hope that you will uh we'll
 
01:57:53.189 --> 01:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
move this forward
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
we have two two two minor changes that
 
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
we would request
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
and the two small changes are right at
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
the end of page three
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
lines eighteen and nineteen um
 
01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.189 align:start position:0%
lines eighteen and nineteen um
ultimately

01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
what i think we have concerned with is
 
01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
the two-year sunset provision
 
01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh as you all know uh certainty for
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
industry is an important uh
 
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
factor and so uh if we're going to go
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
through this entire process it would
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
make sense to us as the industry
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
make this a permanent right and feature
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
for the industry to
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
to pursue and and i will say that the
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
the consumers have responded uh pretty
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
positively over the course of the
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic as you know
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh we were we've had a very tough year
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh stating the obvious
 
01:58:35.109 --> 01:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
um you know that uh you know we were
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
closed for a number of months there
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
and obviously one of our biggest outlets
 
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
only outlet was take out delivery and
 
01:58:42.149 --> 01:58:42.159 align:start position:0%
the part of that
 
01:58:44.229 --> 01:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
obviously was uh beer and wine as part
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
of a you know a meal package
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
um so that certainly uh has helped some
 
01:58:48.719 --> 01:58:50.070 align:start position:0%
um so that certainly uh has helped some
businesses

01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
you know uh there's uh some folks that
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
have said that uh you know it's it's not
 
01:58:56.550 --> 01:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
that big a piece of business and frankly
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
they're right it's not a huge piece of
 
01:58:59.350 --> 01:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
business for the industry but
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
for those industry members that have
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
pursued it it's an important piece of
 
01:59:03.910 --> 01:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
their business so
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know we would respectfully
 
01:59:07.589 --> 01:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
request that that you move this forward
 
01:59:11.109 --> 01:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
so the two-year sunset really is our
 
01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
biggest issue there
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
and the other piece that i would ask for
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
is if we could this
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh this essentially allows that uh it
 
01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
would take effect 60 days after passage
 
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that i would urge
 
01:59:27.669 --> 01:59:27.679 align:start position:0%
you to consider is that
 
01:59:30.070 --> 01:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
if the emergency order is to expire we
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't know when that's going to be
 
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
it would make sense for just the
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
continuity if we could uh pass this
 
01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
and have it effective as soon as
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
possible so that there wouldn't be any
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
gap in the ability for businesses to
 
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
have this in a business model and again
 
01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
goes back to certainty that
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
if you have the right under the
 
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
emergency order the emergency order
 
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
expires but then it kicks in as a right
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
later on
 
01:59:52.709 --> 01:59:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh it's almost a guarantee that
 
01:59:54.390 --> 01:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
somebody's gonna get caught selling in
 
01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:54.709 align:start position:0%
somebody's gonna get caught selling in
that

01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
in that gap not knowing that they they
 
01:59:58.229 --> 01:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
weren't didn't have the right to do so
 
01:59:58.239 --> 01:59:58.709 align:start position:0%
weren't didn't have the right to do so
so

01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:00.870 --> 02:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
we would just respectfully ask that we
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh potentially move that to have it
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
um upon passage so
 
02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
i think that's uh the extent of my uh
 
02:00:10.629 --> 02:00:10.639 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'd be happy to try to
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay we do have questions uh
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative weston
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm not sure this
 
02:00:22.149 --> 02:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
really should go to mike summers it's
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
more of a general question
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
we recently discussed hb 593 which was
 
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
delivery services like grubhub and
 
02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:34.950 align:start position:0%
delivery services like grubhub and
doordash

02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
doordash
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering how that their
 
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
services would mesh with this
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
new rule representative thank you for
 
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
the question and frankly
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't affect those third-party
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
delivery systems the way this is drafted
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
the only way that alcohol could be
 
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
delivered they would have to be
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
delivered by an employee of the
 
02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:53.030 align:start position:0%
delivered by an employee of the
establishment

02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
so whilst your third-party delivery
 
02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
companies can deliver food they would
 
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
not be able to participate
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
in um in the delivery of alcohol and
 
02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
frankly that was worked out in the early
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
days so late
 
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
2019 we had met with liquor liquor
 
02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:06.870 align:start position:0%
2019 we had met with liquor liquor
commission

02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:01:10.950 --> 02:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh attorney moore was uh
 
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
part of those conversations and we had
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
essentially talked through
 
02:01:16.629 --> 02:01:16.639 align:start position:0%
the uh chain of liability chain of
 
02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
custody and their concerns and
 
02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's how we really established that it
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
really needed to be an employee that was
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
going to deliver alcohol so essentially
 
02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
left out of this this piece of
 
02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:27.669 align:start position:0%
left out of this this piece of
legislation

02:01:27.669 --> 02:01:27.679 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you uh
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs yes thank you
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
mr summers can you tell me if under the
 
02:01:39.189 --> 02:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh emergency order
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
is there a limit to the amount of
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
alcohol that can be delivered
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh there is uh and is my understanding
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
that the amounts in the emergency order
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
are uh the same as in this bill but
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
attorney moore would probably be the
 
02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
answer that could
 
02:01:54.149 --> 02:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh definitely clarify that for you
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
for the question being clear yeah so my
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
question is do you agree with um
 
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
i believe was mr mourin um who's who
 
02:02:05.109 --> 02:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
was advocating that um the volume be
 
02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
limited under this bill do you agree
 
02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:02:11.109 --> 02:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
i don't i think the uh the the limits
 
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
that are in the bill i think makes sense
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
and and that's simply because if you're
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
in a uh
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
say you have a few friends over for
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
dinner you know two bottles of wine is
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
not going to go very far
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
when you have five or six people in your
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
home so i think that uh
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
you know these are kind of reasonable
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
amounts i think this is manageable
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and i don't think it's an overly
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
large quantity of alcohol frankly
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
and i would also suspect that people are
 
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
going to order based on the number of
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
folks that are there right so they're
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
not going to order the maximum every
 
02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:40.550 align:start position:0%
not going to order the maximum every
time

02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:02:42.070 --> 02:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
if it's a husband and wife having dinner
 
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
they're probably getting one bottle of
 
02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
wine or maybe it's a four pack of
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
craft brews or something but if you're
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
having friends over you may need
 
02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
the the ability to order a little bit
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
more so that everyone can enjoy a
 
02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:54.629 align:start position:0%
more so that everyone can enjoy a
cocktail

02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
cocktail
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.510 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
members

02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.040 align:start position:0%

and then you're good to go okay just
 
02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
have to mute yourself
 
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh can you hear me okay yes we

can
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for allowing me
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
to testify i have not
 
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify um as this
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
committee knows we have been
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
opposed to versions of the bill of this
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
bill because of our concerns around
 
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
greater access to alcohol without
 
02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily providing any more resources
 
02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
to um substance use disorder prevention
 
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
treatment and recovery services however
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
i was
 
02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
we just signed in in opposition on this
 
02:03:56.069 --> 02:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
bill because we thought the senate
 
02:03:58.870 --> 02:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
version and the exercises that we had
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
gone through in the senate
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
was a fair compromise um i think the
 
02:04:05.350 --> 02:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
two-year sunset is something we really
 
02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
feel strongly about
 
02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't realize that there was going
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
to be a move to try to remove
 
02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
that today um and so if um
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
the committee chooses to do so then our
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh passive
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
opposition would ex move to much more
 
02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:20.310 align:start position:0%
opposition would ex move to much more
active

02:04:20.310 --> 02:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
active
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
um i think that we still don't have the
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
data every time we ask
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
really how many groups how many
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
restaurants are taking advantage of this
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
what is the volume
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
we've asked this several times we
 
02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten an answer
 
02:04:37.109 --> 02:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
um i think the move the amendment gets
 
02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
us there a little bit
 
02:04:40.229 --> 02:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
closer i would agree with the earlier
 
02:04:40.239 --> 02:04:41.589 align:start position:0%
closer i would agree with the earlier
testimony

02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
um from brian moran that that third
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
point that he requested would be
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
something we'd be
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
interested in knowing too really what is
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
the volume what are we talking about
 
02:04:51.119 --> 02:04:51.430 align:start position:0%
the volume what are we talking about
here

02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:04:53.669 --> 02:04:53.679 align:start position:0%
is this really making a difference and
 
02:04:54.790 --> 02:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
if that's the case
 
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
then when there is time two years after
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
and we really
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
reevaluate this we hear the data and
 
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
then the legislature can decide
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
so i really encourage the committee to
 
02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
um keep the bill as is um how it was
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
given to you in the senate and keep that
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
two-year sunset so we can just really
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
look at
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
kind of real data and evidence-based
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
policies regarding alcohol accessibility
 
02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you kate oh we do have a question
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative you have a
 
02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
question for ms frye yeah i do
 
02:05:36.149 --> 02:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question if the
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
data shows that there are
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
significant volumes uh would that show
 
02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:41.109 align:start position:0%
significant volumes uh would that show
that

02:05:41.109 --> 02:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
the program to allow take out alcohol is
 
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.350 align:start position:0%
the program to allow take out alcohol is
successful

02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
successful
 
02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
if the volume is high in the data i
 
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
think there's a number of things that we
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
could evaluate if that was the case
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
if if that is high you know if it's
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
something that is working
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
sure that's a great point but do we also
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
know from the data
 
02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
that there are um appropriate stop
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
gaps um to make sure that this is um
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
not affecting for example miners or um
 
02:06:11.589 --> 02:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
other populations or are there other
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
improvements we can make from the bill
 
02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
but you can't make any of those
 
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:24.629 --> 02:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for miss fry
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
c none we thank you very much and
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i appreciate
 
02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:38.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i appreciate
being

02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
able to answer any questions that the
 
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
committee may have on senate bill 66
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm happy to take those questions
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
if you haven't
 
02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
so aiden were you in the room when this
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
two-year sunset
 
02:06:57.750 --> 02:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
got stuck in this build uh excuse me i i
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
did monitor the
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
senate hearing and i think there was
 
02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:02.229 align:start position:0%
senate hearing and i think there was
some

02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh question about um
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
from the senate whether or not um
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
there was adequate data that would look
 
02:07:14.069 --> 02:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
at whether or not this was
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
something that they would like to change
 
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
permanently and therefore
 
02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
i believe the motion was put into put a
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
two-year sunset
 
02:07:26.470 --> 02:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
into the bill um so that
 
02:07:28.229 --> 02:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
the legislature could look at it one
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
more time and determine whether or not
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's something that they'd like to make
 
02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
a permanent
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
public policy i guess it begs the
 
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
questions did this happen right after we
 
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
put the two-year sunset on the
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
on the doordash bill uh
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
i did not participate or listen to the
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
door dash bill
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
but i would think that great legislative
 
02:07:50.550 --> 02:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
minds think alike so
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
well this is a totally different reason
 
02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:53.669 align:start position:0%
well this is a totally different reason
rick

02:07:53.669 --> 02:07:53.679 align:start position:0%
rick
 
02:07:55.589 --> 02:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
isn't right now isn't the governor we
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to have this right now that
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
that this is going on by a governor's
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
order that their alcohol is being
 
02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:01.910 align:start position:0%
order that their alcohol is being
delivered

02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
the the order is has been extended and
 
02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:04.950 align:start position:0%
the the order is has been extended and
to

02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
um answer i forget which representative
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
posed the question but the
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
um amount of alcohol in this bill is the
 
02:08:13.589 --> 02:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
same as what's
 
02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
allowed by the executive order
 
02:08:18.550 --> 02:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
the difference in one of the things that
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
people are looking for as far as
 
02:08:21.669 --> 02:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
measurement is
 
02:08:23.669 --> 02:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
that moving forward if this bill were to
 
02:08:23.679 --> 02:08:24.870 align:start position:0%
that moving forward if this bill were to
pass

02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:08:27.669 --> 02:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
now a business would be needing to pay
 
02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:30.079 align:start position:0%
an additional 250 dollar fee that's
 
02:08:32.870 --> 02:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
something they don't have to pay for now
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
and so therefore we would be able to
 
02:08:36.149 --> 02:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
tell you precisely
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
how many businesses were taking
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
advantage of this because of the fact
 
02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
that they would have to pay the
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
additional fee
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
and i think that would go towards
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
providing um
 
02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
data to the legislature to new futures
 
02:08:50.149 --> 02:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
and other
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
groups who may be interested in
 
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not this is a
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
policy worth pursuing
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
after the after the sunset period
 
02:08:56.719 --> 02:08:58.950 align:start position:0%
after the after the sunset period
expires

02:08:58.950 --> 02:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
expires
 
02:09:00.550 --> 02:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
no that makes no sense because the fee
 
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
is in this bill
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
so yes that's correct we are signing up
 
02:09:06.390 --> 02:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
for the v right so
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
mr summers says get rid of the sunset uh
 
02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:09.990 align:start position:0%
mr summers says get rid of the sunset uh
he's

02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
he's
 
02:09:12.629 --> 02:09:12.639 align:start position:0%
he's saying signing i'm okay with the
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
fee you know
 
02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
forever and ever i can't speak for mr
 
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
summers but
 
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh i would okay certainly say he can
 
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
speak for himself
 
02:09:23.109 --> 02:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
no i understand that but i'm just saying
 
02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
that there they don't seem to have you
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
know there'd be one thing if
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
the fee wasn't there but if he is there
 
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.270 align:start position:0%
the fee wasn't there but if he is there
so

02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative ed houghton has a
 
02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:32.709 align:start position:0%
okay representative ed houghton has a
question

02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr sharon thank you
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
attorney more um
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
assuming that some of these bills that
 
02:09:40.709 --> 02:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that we are seeing
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
is pandemic driven
 
02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
um particularly in the area of liquor
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
were to remain what kind of impact would
 
02:09:50.229 --> 02:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
there be on what we know
 
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
representative that's a
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
a huge question and i think
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
none of us really know exactly how
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to shake out
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
there's certainly a number of changes
 
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
that have been proposed
 
02:10:13.109 --> 02:10:13.119 align:start position:0%
which um my time with the state started
 
02:10:14.310 --> 02:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
in 1981
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
when i first joined the liquor
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
commission's enforcement division
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
and uh during that time there has there
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
continual steps to um
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say consolidate but the
 
02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:29.510 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say consolidate but the
the

02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
clear and distinct lines between retail
 
02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:33.350 align:start position:0%
clear and distinct lines between retail
wholesale

02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
wholesale
 
02:10:37.030 --> 02:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
and manufacturing have become blurred
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
many of the things that were for example
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
privileges enjoyed by the retailers are
 
02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:41.750 align:start position:0%
privileges enjoyed by the retailers are
now

02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
enjoyed by manufacturers
 
02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
and some of the policies that are being
 
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
moved forward they have yet to settle
 
02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
and we really don't have a clear
 
02:10:59.669 --> 02:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
idea regarding what the long-term
 
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
impact will be certainly there is a
 
02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
revenue for the state of new hampshire
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
and that the liquor commission is
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
in the liquor alcohol business is an
 
02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
important source of revenue to the
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
as well as uh public health issues and i
 
02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:17.109 align:start position:0%
as well as uh public health issues and i
think

02:11:17.109 --> 02:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
new futures and ms fry's organization
 
02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:20.470 align:start position:0%
new futures and ms fry's organization
certainly

02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
tries to keep their finger on the pulse
 
02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
of public health questions
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
so you've you've asked a great question
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
and i i would tell you i i really don't
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh have an answer that i could give you
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
that would probably be satisfying
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
the broader question you're asking but
 
02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
there has been a significant amount of
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
legislation moving the session dealing
 
02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
with alcohol
 
02:11:46.229 --> 02:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
and some of the pieces mesh well some of
 
02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
the pieces
 
02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
don't and that's the challenge i think
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
for the agency potentially to administer
 
02:11:54.719 --> 02:11:56.390 align:start position:0%
for the agency potentially to administer
these

02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
should they all pass and i think
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
probably the legislative services
 
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
will be working hard to try to reconcile
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
issues of that may conflict or where
 
02:12:06.719 --> 02:12:07.109 align:start position:0%
issues of that may conflict or where
there

02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
have been passed in two different places
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
and how to resolve them so
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
i've tried to be as responsive as i can
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
to your question representative i
 
02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
i apologize if if i have not been
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
and no i realize the nebulous nature of
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
what i've what i've asked of you and i
 
02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate your insights thank you very
 
02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:27.510 align:start position:0%
appreciate your insights thank you very
much

02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for attorney
 
02:12:30.239 --> 02:12:31.430 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for attorney
more

02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh kate did you put your hand back up
 
02:12:34.870 --> 02:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
again did you
 
02:12:37.030 --> 02:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes i just i did this sorry to bother
 
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
the committee again but i just thought
 
02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:38.709 align:start position:0%
the committee again but i just thought
that

02:12:38.709 --> 02:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:40.709 --> 02:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to add some clarity on the
 
02:12:41.830 --> 02:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
question of where the
 
02:12:44.229 --> 02:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
um two-year sunset came and it was
 
02:12:44.239 --> 02:12:45.350 align:start position:0%
um two-year sunset came and it was
actually

02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
went back a year ago to when all of
 
02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:48.790 align:start position:0%
went back a year ago to when all of
these

02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:12:51.270 --> 02:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills happened in the senate and
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
this was one of them
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
and because the senate had gotten
 
02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
several calls and concerns about this
 
02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
they had actually added in that two-year
 
02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
sunset in the spring
 
02:13:04.870 --> 02:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
because that bill was uh vetoed
 
02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
um that didn't go anywhere and so when
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
the senate had this bill again
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
they put back the piece that they had
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
added in the spring so i just wanted to
 
02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
add that for clarity
 
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
that made me feel so much better today
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
yes you don't have to i didn't worry
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to get into the community
 
02:13:21.030 --> 02:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
of conference and be battling over
 
02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:22.790 align:start position:0%
of conference and be battling over
sunsets

02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
sunsets
 
02:13:26.310 --> 02:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you very much uh
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
all right so is there anyone else would
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
like to speak raise your hand
 
02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
please otherwise uh
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
we have let's see what it is
 
02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
and just briefly mr chairman i want to
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%

obviously turned out to be relatively
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
bad timing
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
we did call the governor's office to
 
02:14:58.229 --> 02:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
inquire about the last main street
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
relief program
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
and learned that new businesses would
 
02:15:02.229 --> 02:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
not qualify because we didn't have
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
revenue in 2019
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
a representative of the governor's
 
02:15:07.030 --> 02:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
office i'm telling you literally in
 
02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:07.750 align:start position:0%
office i'm telling you literally in

02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
quotes
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
told us we should have known better than
 
02:15:11.589 --> 02:15:11.599 align:start position:0%
open restaurants during the
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
in that environment but i'm here
 
02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
mostly to make sure everybody knows that
 
02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
new businesses aren't really new
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh in most cases takes a year to play
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
years to plan in our case
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
we formed our llc in 2000 are you
 
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.320 align:start position:0%

02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
perkins quoca from senate district 21
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
representing the city of portsmouth in
 
02:17:08.790 --> 02:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
the towns of madbury lee durham
 
02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
newington newmarket in newfields i am
 
02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:13.519 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of sb 107 relative to
 
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
financial assistance for businesses
 
02:17:18.469 --> 02:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
affected by the coven 19 pandemic
 
02:17:20.549 --> 02:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
the main street relief fund was designed
 
02:17:22.309 --> 02:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
for main street businesses
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
instead many of these small local main
 
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
street businesses
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
lost out and it was large multinational
 
02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
chain stores that received the
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
assistance we received from the federal
 
02:17:31.439 --> 02:17:32.629 align:start position:0%
assistance we received from the federal
government

02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
many local small businesses were unable
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
to access the main street relief fund
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
because of the arbitrary date imposed on
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
their formation
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
prior to may 26 2019
 
02:17:44.709 --> 02:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
and a requirement to produce financial
 
02:17:47.349 --> 02:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
statements from 2019
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
this unfortunately cut out a large
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
segment of new small businesses
 
02:17:54.070 --> 02:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
which fill new needs in our communities
 
02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
and create the most
 
02:17:57.509 --> 02:17:57.519 align:start position:0%
new jobs at a time when they were really
 
02:17:57.519 --> 02:17:58.790 align:start position:0%
new jobs at a time when they were really
struggling

02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
struggling
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
sb 107 would ensure that newer
 
02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:01.910 align:start position:0%
sb 107 would ensure that newer
businesses

02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
will be able to access any future relief
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
funds regardless of their date of
 
02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:06.870 align:start position:0%
funds regardless of their date of
establishment

02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
because the newer the business the more
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
critical supporting it is
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
these new businesses invest in their
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
business well before they can
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
open and often their opening is delayed
 
02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
due to various factors beyond their
 
02:18:18.479 --> 02:18:19.349 align:start position:0%
due to various factors beyond their
control

02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
such as permitting financing title
 
02:18:22.479 --> 02:18:23.270 align:start position:0%
such as permitting financing title
concerns

02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
supply chains or other items it's
 
02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
important for us to support our newest
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
small businesses by directing any future
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
discretionary federal funding we receive
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
as a state
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
to these newest businesses
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for the opportunity
 
02:18:41.349 --> 02:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
to present sb-107

be happy to try to answer any questions
 
02:18:44.790 --> 02:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
you may have i've been meeting with a
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
group of small business owners who
 
02:18:47.589 --> 02:18:47.599 align:start position:0%
missed out on the main street relief
 
02:18:47.599 --> 02:18:48.309 align:start position:0%
missed out on the main street relief
fund

02:18:48.309 --> 02:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:18:49.910 --> 02:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
because they were too new and i believe
 
02:18:51.750 --> 02:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
many of them are on this call and will
 
02:18:53.190 --> 02:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
be speaking
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
i also believe senator bradley is here
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
to speak and i would be grateful if he
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
could be recognized next
 
02:19:03.509 --> 02:19:03.519 align:start position:0%
okay um yeah i guess just help me out
 
02:19:03.519 --> 02:19:03.830 align:start position:0%
okay um yeah i guess just help me out
here

02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh so we're you're expecting more money
 
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
funded and and and this just doesn't say
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
what the parameters are just says they
 
02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
should get something
 
02:19:15.429 --> 02:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
is that am i reading this right that's
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
right chairman
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
so the intent um is obviously to leave
 
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking so to speak
 
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
to gopher because you know this is
 
02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
obviously what they've
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
done in the past but to express the
 
02:19:32.709 --> 02:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
legislative intent that we do want
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
these newer businesses included in any

um limitations to the coveted
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
relief funds set by the state are set by
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
02:20:19.590 --> 02:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh federal guidelines yeah thank you
 
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%

representative
 
02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
in our case the date of may 26 2019 was
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
not contained in the federal
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines that was um imposed on the
 
02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
businesses by the state
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
okay may i ask another question
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
thanks very much um i'm going to put my
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
insurance hat on because i was
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
in insurance for 35 years and one of the
 
02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:43.510 align:start position:0%
in insurance for 35 years and one of the
issues

02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
that businesses have after a loss is
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
being able to establish
 
02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
what their receipts would have been
 
02:20:56.070 --> 02:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
but for the loss um
 
02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
what kinds of requirements
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
would you see that would be reasonable
 
02:21:07.750 --> 02:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
to put on a newly opened business
 
02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
who had not had receipts
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
sure and thank you again for the
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
thoughtful question representative
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
so i understand that this poses some
 
02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:19.429 align:start position:0%
so i understand that this poses some
challenge

02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
um and i appreciate your insurance
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
analyzing it
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
um however i do you know i do think
 
02:21:28.389 --> 02:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
there are ways that we
 
02:21:33.190 --> 02:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
can help these newer businesses um
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
show or establish you know a loss due
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
specifically to the pandemic
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
for example banks that provide you know
 
02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:42.710 align:start position:0%
for example banks that provide you know
construction

02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
construction
 
02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
financing or even the very lenders that
 
02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
lent to these businesses
 
02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
due diligence based on for example
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
industry standard receipts
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
or market research or appraisals that
 
02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
help those very banks you know project
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
what the income streams will be for
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
these businesses and lending them money
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
and in addition i do think you know
 
02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
there is industry data
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
from around the country that while not
 
02:22:09.439 --> 02:22:09.990 align:start position:0%
from around the country that while not
um

02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:11.910 --> 02:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
while it may not be from that individual
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
business can certainly
 
02:22:16.469 --> 02:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
help us help our businesses you know to
 
02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
to do the diligence we need to do to
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that um
 
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
we can both you know exercise do care in
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
allocating these funds to these
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
businesses and yet recognize that
 
02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
simply because they don't have 2019
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
receipts doesn't mean that they're not
 
02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
a new business that adds to our
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
community and doesn't need our support
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for the senator
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh cnn okay senator bradley because i
 
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
know that's who jeb
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh good morning uh chairman hunt and
 
02:22:56.469 --> 02:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh good to see all of you folks um
 
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
i just want to second the remarks of my
 
02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
colleague represent
 
02:23:06.389 --> 02:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
senator perkins cuoco i think she did an
 
02:23:07.750 --> 02:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
excellent job
 
02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
outlining the testimony that
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
the senate commerce committee heard from
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
a number
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
of small businesses some of whom i
 
02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
believe are on
 
02:23:22.389 --> 02:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
your public hearing this morning
 
02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
i think one of the things that was very
 
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
compelling is
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
when somebody had purchased a business
 
02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
that was an existing business
 
02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
they were deemed to be a new business
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
and they did not have access
 
02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
um to either main street um
 
02:23:44.309 --> 02:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
funds and so it just seems to make sense
 
02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:47.490 align:start position:0%
to all of us in the senate that um
 
02:23:47.490 --> 02:23:48.870 align:start position:0%
to all of us in the senate that um
[Music]

02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
the same kind of criteria apply to these
 
02:23:53.670 --> 02:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
new businesses
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
um that um are for
 
02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
businesses that have been in existence a
 
02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
little longer
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
especially businesses that are brand new
 
02:24:04.319 --> 02:24:05.429 align:start position:0%
especially businesses that are brand new
or

02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:24:08.309 --> 02:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
recently purchased obviously there's
 
02:24:09.270 --> 02:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of money federal
 
02:24:14.230 --> 02:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
money coming to new hampshire
 
02:24:16.469 --> 02:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
i think it's very premature to say what
 
02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
that money is going to be used for but
 
02:24:22.389 --> 02:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
should there be something similar to
 
02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
the main street relief fund or a second
 
02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
version of
 
02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
i think we would hope that these
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
businesses that were
 
02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
not able to participate would be able
 
02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill
 
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
does so um thank you very much mr
 
02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:37.990 align:start position:0%
does so um thank you very much mr
chairman

02:24:37.990 --> 02:24:38.000 align:start position:0%

02:24:41.190 --> 02:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
and appreciate the opportunity to
 
02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:54.840 align:start position:0%

uh okay so now mr clark here
 
02:25:02.950 --> 02:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
now now we can hear from you
 
02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
all right here let me uh
 
02:25:09.270 --> 02:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
so uh as i said i'm doug clark i have a
 
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
couple of restaurants in downtown durham
 
02:25:15.190 --> 02:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
um we uh we applied for the first round
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
of the main street relief
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
and uh we're told that we should have
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
known better than open businesses
 
02:25:23.270 --> 02:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
in 2020 but they
 
02:25:25.110 --> 02:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
we kind of the our story kind of fell on
 
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
deaf ears which is
 
02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
that uh new businesses take years to
 
02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
plan and in our case we formed llc in
 
02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:32.469 align:start position:0%
plan and in our case we formed llc in
2018

02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
2018
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
we heard our general manager in 2019 and
 
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
started our payroll
 
02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
we acquired our property in march of
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
2019 we completed our plans and got all
 
02:25:41.429 --> 02:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
our approvals to the town in the spring
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
of 2019
 
02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
began construction of our restaurant
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
until june of 2019
 
02:25:50.070 --> 02:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
hired a chef in august of 2019 and now
 
02:25:51.910 --> 02:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
we prepared all our menus and recipes in
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
that fall
 
02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
we completed construction in march just
 
02:25:56.389 --> 02:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
to find out that our equipment our
 
02:25:57.830 --> 02:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
fabricator for our kitchen equipment was
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
rhode island
 
02:26:00.389 --> 02:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
and in march rhode island shut
 
02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
everything down so we weren't able to
 
02:26:03.910 --> 02:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
get our equipment delivered until the
 
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
end of may
 
02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
and that's all cobit related so we
 
02:26:09.510 --> 02:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
weren't able to open until june of 2020.
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
um and so uh with that and obviously
 
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
that was a time when we had a six-foot
 
02:26:16.309 --> 02:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
rule i mean the whole
 
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh capacity restrictions were a bit of a
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
problem for us because even though they
 
02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
say you can do 50
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
if you follow the six foot rule in most
 
02:26:25.750 --> 02:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
cases it's really only about 30 or 35
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
of capacity um for us we're uh we're
 
02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
happy to have a big sidewalk so we were
 
02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
able to put 11 outdoor tables
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
in and uh and and just to the point of
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
can you show an effect on your business
 
02:26:40.389 --> 02:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
as most of you probably know
 
02:26:42.389 --> 02:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
summer is usually the slowest time in
 
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
durham um
 
02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
and uh we were doing about a hundred
 
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a month when we had our
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
11 outdoor tables
 
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
when it started to cool down and the
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
students came back in our town the
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
residents are scared to death of the
 
02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:53.830 align:start position:0%
residents are scared to death of the
students

02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
and they kind of slowed down in their
 
02:26:57.349 --> 02:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
willingness to kind of come downtown and
 
02:26:57.359 --> 02:26:58.150 align:start position:0%
willingness to kind of come downtown and
eat

02:26:58.150 --> 02:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
eat
 
02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
so we saw our revenues go from 100 000
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
all three months
 
02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
of the summer and the students came back
 
02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
in september it went down to 80
 
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
in october went down to 60 and from
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
november to february it was down to 50.
 
02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:10.150 align:start position:0%
november to february it was down to 50.
so

02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:11.429 --> 02:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the winter without the
 
02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
outdoor tables our business was half
 
02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
of what it was in the summer and the
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
summer are traditionally the three
 
02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
slowest months of the year in durham new
 
02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:19.510 align:start position:0%
slowest months of the year in durham new
hampshire

02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:27:22.230 --> 02:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
um so and then just the other point is
 
02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
independently owned businesses
 
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
to me need more help than old businesses
 
02:27:26.550 --> 02:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
you know we're sitting here dreamers
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
this is my retirement plan we put
 
02:27:31.349 --> 02:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
all of our life savings into this and
 
02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
then we got hit by coven uh we don't
 
02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:33.910 align:start position:0%
then we got hit by coven uh we don't
have

02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
years of profits in our history where we
 
02:27:37.990 --> 02:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
could have built up any kind of a
 
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
foundation or a base
 
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
you know we're really struggling kind of
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
day to day um and even more to the point
 
02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
new businesses are needed
 
02:27:45.910 --> 02:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
because they're more relevant than old
 
02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
businesses uh and better position to
 
02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
meet the current needs of the community
 
02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
in our case durham durham's downtown had
 
02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
migrated from being
 
02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
in the 60s it was primarily a resident
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
oriented business
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
with 90 percent of our business catered
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
to the residents we had family
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants all over the place
 
02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
over the course of time it reversed and
 
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
now about 90 percent of the business
 
02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
catered to the students
 
02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's a rotating door and so the
 
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
residents to me are the most underserved
 
02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:10.870 align:start position:0%
residents to me are the most underserved
demographic

02:28:10.870 --> 02:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
demographic
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire the
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
residents and the adults of durham
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
and and people don't seem to understand
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
they're always more adults in durham
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
than students any given day of the year
 
02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
and obviously they have far more
 
02:28:21.270 --> 02:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
disposable income the average student
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
comes to town with about 1600
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
in their pocket which is why we have
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
this crazy revolving door of student
 
02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
oriented businesses in downtown durham
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
um and so in closing i just want to
 
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
emphasize the importance
 
02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
of investing in main street uh local
 
02:28:34.710 --> 02:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
investment into
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
local businesses keep money locally
 
02:28:37.910 --> 02:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
instead of the big
 
02:28:39.750 --> 02:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
chains and big you know the the big
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
chain restaurants to me i'm sure that
 
02:28:43.510 --> 02:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
more most of that money goes out of the
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
state when it's all said and done
 
02:28:48.630 --> 02:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
and to us where the the future of um
 
02:28:51.830 --> 02:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
of having economic sustainability um is
 
02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:52.150 align:start position:0%
of having economic sustainability um is
to

02:28:52.150 --> 02:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
make sure we have a main street downtown
 
02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
in every town
 
02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:14.309 --> 02:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
sorry i keep forgetting to turn it on so
 
02:29:17.750 --> 02:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative herbert do you have a
 
02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:19.830 align:start position:0%
representative herbert do you have a
question

02:29:19.830 --> 02:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's a whole new uh there's a 1.9
 
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
trillion dollar
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh bill i think that has been passed
 
02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
and so uh is it your
 
02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
anticipation that you will be able to
 
02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:41.670 align:start position:0%
anticipation that you will be able to
access

02:29:41.670 --> 02:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
access
 
02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh some of the state's money i mean some
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
of the federal money that's coming in
 
02:29:48.630 --> 02:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
through congress into concord
 
02:29:52.150 --> 02:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh that would be aimed at uh businesses
 
02:29:55.270 --> 02:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
i mean even though the governor didn't
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
allow you to
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh enjoy any uh financial aid
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
with the last uh amount of money
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
what is your uh what is your opinion as
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
to your future
 
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
with uh that 1.9 trillion
 
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh of which i think 400 million dollars
 
02:30:16.710 --> 02:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
is expected to land uh on the governor's
 
02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
pockets or desk rather i'm sorry and
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
just would like your opinion as to
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not you think you may be able
 
02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
to access
 
02:30:34.950 --> 02:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's uh well so for us the um it's all
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
i mean if the criteria doesn't change
 
02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
then we again won't
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
qualify um and so for the state money
 
02:30:49.910 --> 02:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh the federal restaurant recovery act
 
02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
is another program
 
02:30:53.270 --> 02:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
and but basically handcuffed with some
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
of the same restraints i do hear there's
 
02:30:57.270 --> 02:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
some provision for small business
 
02:30:59.270 --> 02:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
with but i haven't seen what the details
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
of that formula are yet
 
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
but but for the most part all of these
 
02:31:05.349 --> 02:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
programs tend to disqualify
 
02:31:06.990 --> 02:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
new businesses because you don't have
 
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
2019 revenue
 
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:15.990 --> 02:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
further question for the question
 
02:31:19.349 --> 02:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
so is that no well
 
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
well obviously we're sitting here
 
02:31:24.150 --> 02:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
helping we're hoping and testifying to
 
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
get uh the state to say that new
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
businesses would qualify for the next
 
02:31:29.830 --> 02:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
round of mainstream relief we think
 
02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's critical
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
rather than you know for me i um i ran
 
02:31:35.349 --> 02:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
the innovation department at timberland
 
02:31:35.359 --> 02:31:35.670 align:start position:0%
the innovation department at timberland
we

02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
i was a new business incubator we kept
 
02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
building all these new brands buying
 
02:31:42.790 --> 02:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
companies and uh in the end when the um
 
02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
the chairman decided to sell the company
 
02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
he said let's uh get rid of our
 
02:31:48.550 --> 02:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
distractions my attitude was
 
02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
you can't throw the babies out with the
 
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
bathwater the babies are the future
 
02:31:53.349 --> 02:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
you know the new business is the ones
 
02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
that are going to pave the way that are
 
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
the most relevant and so
 
02:31:57.910 --> 02:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
for the new businesses to be
 
02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
disqualified from federal aid with the
 
02:32:02.950 --> 02:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
old businesses and in my frustration a
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
lot of the old businesses got their
 
02:32:05.750 --> 02:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
mainstream relief and they basically
 
02:32:07.590 --> 02:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
went into hibernation and so they didn't
 
02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
they didn't even maintain a payroll
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
during that period of time whereas
 
02:32:13.750 --> 02:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
we've hired 45 people and we've kept
 
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
them on the payroll
 
02:32:16.790 --> 02:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
ever since we've opened and that's our
 
02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
intent is to
 
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
keep people employed and keep the
 
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
economy going as best we can
 
02:32:25.510 --> 02:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
one final question uh chairman hunt sure
 
02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh if this law if this particular piece
 
02:32:30.630 --> 02:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
of legislation
 
02:32:34.389 --> 02:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
passes uh would that change the
 
02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
i believe somebody's gonna get yeah it
 
02:32:45.270 --> 02:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
depends on what we get but i think
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
anything helps at this point i mean
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
we're clinging on um
 
02:32:51.190 --> 02:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
but uh we're we're losing money uh we're
 
02:32:52.710 --> 02:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh we've had to make
 
02:32:54.550 --> 02:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
major adjustments with our takeout
 
02:32:55.830 --> 02:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
business instead of our our
 
02:32:58.469 --> 02:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
uh dine in business um we've had to
 
02:33:00.710 --> 02:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
invest a lot of money in setting up
 
02:33:03.270 --> 02:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh hepa filters and cleaning systems uh
 
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
in our
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
in our air conditioning systems
 
02:33:07.270 --> 02:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
sanitizers masks
 
02:33:09.590 --> 02:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
um outdoor tables outdoor chairs we
 
02:33:11.270 --> 02:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
actually literally rebuilt the sidewalks
 
02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
in front of our restaurant which cost
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
twenty thirty thousand dollars um but
 
02:33:16.389 --> 02:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
that was how
 
02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
that was the only way we were able to
 
02:33:19.670 --> 02:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
kind of get through last summer and then
 
02:33:21.349 --> 02:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
navigate as best we could through the
 
02:33:21.359 --> 02:33:24.230 align:start position:0%
navigate as best we could through the
winter

02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%

representing strike 9 brewing and
 
02:34:10.230 --> 02:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of our background we
 
02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
also purchased a 5 000 square foot
 
02:34:15.510 --> 02:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
used to be a pharmacy in a
 
02:34:17.670 --> 02:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
revitalization zone of somersworth new
 
02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:18.630 align:start position:0%
revitalization zone of somersworth new
hampshire

02:34:18.630 --> 02:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
in 20 2018 we spent about a year
 
02:34:24.150 --> 02:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
converting the existing building
 
02:34:26.630 --> 02:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
into a brewery and brew pub so just like
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
we went through licensing um permitting
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
um approvals change of use et cetera
 
02:34:40.469 --> 02:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
to open strike nine in september of 2019
 
02:34:43.990 --> 02:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
at the time we employed 20 employees
 
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
we were closed uh per government order
 
02:34:48.550 --> 02:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
on march 16th
 
02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
2020. one of the challenges that we had
 
02:34:55.030 --> 02:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
is we did not develop our business model
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
for a takeout model this is a brew pub
 
02:34:59.270 --> 02:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
for those of you who have been to brew
 
02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:00.230 align:start position:0%
for those of you who have been to brew
pub

02:35:00.230 --> 02:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
pub
 
02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
most people like to go in and enjoy the
 
02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:03.270 align:start position:0%
most people like to go in and enjoy the
entertainment

02:35:03.270 --> 02:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
entertainment
 
02:35:06.950 --> 02:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
um we were closed so
 
02:35:09.030 --> 02:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
we temporarily closed and then reopened
 
02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
in april
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh end of april 2020 uh attempting to
 
02:35:14.469 --> 02:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
try the
 
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
take out model um the end result just
 
02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:18.870 align:start position:0%
take out model um the end result just
from

02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:35:21.990 --> 02:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of revenue is our revenue fell
 
02:35:25.030 --> 02:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
even with a takeout model more than 50
 
02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:25.510 align:start position:0%
even with a takeout model more than 50
percent

02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:35:29.349 --> 02:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
quarter over quarter um so to answer
 
02:35:30.870 --> 02:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh one of the questions that came up
 
02:35:32.790 --> 02:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
from representative bartlett
 
02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that i would
 
02:35:36.070 --> 02:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
advocate for this bill
 
02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
is for businesses that were open but not
 
02:35:40.790 --> 02:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
for a full year
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
you could use a proxy in previous
 
02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:43.910 align:start position:0%
you could use a proxy in previous
quarters

02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
quarters
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
to get a sense for what the receipts
 
02:35:48.309 --> 02:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
were and how much of a
 
02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
loss there was to businesses that were
 
02:35:51.359 --> 02:35:52.070 align:start position:0%
loss there was to businesses that were
open

02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
open
 
02:35:55.030 --> 02:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
less than a year um one of the things i
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
would say is
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know for any of the people speaking
 
02:35:59.429 --> 02:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
today small business owners
 
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
nobody could really foresee the pandemic
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
in the risk assessment of opening a
 
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
business and it's
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
you know overall impact um so
 
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know my view is that for
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
businesses open less than a year
 
02:36:17.830 --> 02:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
they're probably uh equally harmed
 
02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
probably even in some cases more
 
02:36:22.309 --> 02:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
financially impacted
 
02:36:24.230 --> 02:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
because working capital reserves are
 
02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
stressed in the first year of startup
 
02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the first year startup
 
02:36:31.270 --> 02:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of hiring training
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
essentially paying for permitting and
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
license fees
 
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
and really trying to get the business
 
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
open um
 
02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
you know the main street fund would have
 
02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:43.349 align:start position:0%
you know the main street fund would have
helped

02:36:43.349 --> 02:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
helped
 
02:36:46.309 --> 02:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
um sort of get through some of the
 
02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
financial challenges
 
02:36:51.990 --> 02:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh that were had and i think uh you know
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
one of the positive things about this
 
02:36:55.990 --> 02:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
bill is uh if it's passed
 
02:36:58.150 --> 02:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
um it sort of brings uh some sort of
 
02:36:59.190 --> 02:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
parity back
 
02:37:01.990 --> 02:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh to those businesses that were in my
 
02:37:03.110 --> 02:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
opinion more
 
02:37:06.630 --> 02:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
severely impacted as a result of
 
02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:07.270 align:start position:0%
severely impacted as a result of
pandemic

02:37:07.270 --> 02:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:37:11.670 --> 02:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
in being open less than a year
 
02:37:14.309 --> 02:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
one other thing that i'll just note is
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
this came up in the senate hearing
 
02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
there was a question about you know
 
02:37:18.479 --> 02:37:19.590 align:start position:0%
there was a question about you know
funding

02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
of any businesses that may not survive
 
02:37:24.230 --> 02:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a legitimate question
 
02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh for taxpayers and representatives um
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
is you know why fund a business that may
 
02:37:31.590 --> 02:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
fail um
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
i think you know you know
 
02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
businesses that are looking for any
 
02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
funds should be able to provide
 
02:37:42.389 --> 02:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
a profit and loss and a balance sheet
 
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
that does
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
that does indicate that they will
 
02:37:46.319 --> 02:37:47.670 align:start position:0%
that does indicate that they will
survive

02:37:47.670 --> 02:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
survive
 
02:37:50.950 --> 02:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
this pandemic because it's you know
 
02:37:54.150 --> 02:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's taxpayer money that's being issued
 
02:37:57.510 --> 02:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
again i think small businesses have been
 
02:37:57.520 --> 02:37:58.950 align:start position:0%
again i think small businesses have been
hurt

more so than larger businesses but they
 
02:38:04.469 --> 02:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
do have to prove that they can survive
 
02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:07.920 align:start position:0%

putin on the glitz 40 market street
 
02:38:51.910 --> 02:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
downtown portsmouth
 
02:38:56.309 --> 02:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
um this is my fifth year here
 
02:38:58.309 --> 02:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
i was employed i had two jobs to get
 
02:38:59.910 --> 02:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
here and i'm here
 
02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
to testify on behalf of sb 107
 
02:39:07.910 --> 02:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
in favor of it because um
 
02:39:10.309 --> 02:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
with the new businesses you know i think
 
02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be
 
02:39:13.510 --> 02:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
riding on the backs of what has already
 
02:39:15.190 --> 02:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
been said but
 
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
we don't wake up one morning and say
 
02:39:18.309 --> 02:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
tomorrow i'm going to open
 
02:39:21.349 --> 02:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
it takes two to three years to get there
 
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
i worked here i was a dental hygienist
 
02:39:25.750 --> 02:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
health reasons had to retire
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
um landed here with the previous owner
 
02:39:30.790 --> 02:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
and about six months in
 
02:39:32.790 --> 02:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
the conversation she approached me to
 
02:39:34.710 --> 02:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
purchase the business
 
02:39:36.830 --> 02:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
i set right out to score and took my
 
02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:38.070 align:start position:0%
i set right out to score and took my
courses

02:39:38.070 --> 02:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
courses
 
02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
how to own a business first you know how
 
02:39:41.429 --> 02:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
to get your first
 
02:39:44.710 --> 02:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
commercial business loan um
 
02:39:46.630 --> 02:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
i then went to small business
 
02:39:48.389 --> 02:39:48.399 align:start position:0%
development association i'm still
 
02:39:51.030 --> 02:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
a client there and they have guided me
 
02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
through all of this
 
02:39:56.150 --> 02:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
when the first main street grant came up
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
last spring
 
02:39:59.270 --> 02:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
i was like okay i don't qualify i'm kind
 
02:40:00.389 --> 02:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
of new
 
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
gap we also didn't
 
02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
qualify by november of 2020
 
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
i knew we weren't out of this pandemic
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
and heading into another winter
 
02:40:15.269 --> 02:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
um you know where we do slow down
 
02:40:17.750 --> 02:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
we need july august september october
 
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
through december to build up for those
 
02:40:21.349 --> 02:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
quiet months
 
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
i do have record on of my first quarter
 
02:40:28.150 --> 02:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
which was the last quarter of 2019
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
i matched what the previous owner did
 
02:40:32.630 --> 02:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
and a little bit above
 
02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
so the formula worked and what is that
 
02:40:36.309 --> 02:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
formula i always questioned that and
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
with the senate
 
02:40:40.389 --> 02:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
um what that is is your business model
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
and it takes two years to build that get
 
02:40:43.510 --> 02:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
your own ducks in a row and then
 
02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:44.389 align:start position:0%
your own ducks in a row and then
negotiate

02:40:44.389 --> 02:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
negotiate
 
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
get a business valuation and now those
 
02:40:47.990 --> 02:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
procedures to get
 
02:40:51.269 --> 02:40:51.279 align:start position:0%
a loan are based on the previous owner's
 
02:40:54.070 --> 02:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
numbers so we have those numbers um this
 
02:40:56.309 --> 02:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
time there was an appeal process
 
02:40:58.469 --> 02:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
but i got nowhere and i reached out to
 
02:41:00.309 --> 02:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
the governor and the senators and it was
 
02:41:02.550 --> 02:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
senator rebecca cloca that answered my
 
02:41:04.150 --> 02:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
call literally
 
02:41:07.510 --> 02:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
um so here we are now yes it would have
 
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
helped these last three months
 
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
um you know i've reduced orders there
 
02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
was no computerized inventory so what
 
02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
did i do during the shutdown the
 
02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:15.990 align:start position:0%
did i do during the shutdown the
mandated

02:41:15.990 --> 02:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
shutdown last spring i came in every day
 
02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
and if you can kind of see
 
02:41:21.349 --> 02:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
my lovely little shopping here there's a
 
02:41:23.190 --> 02:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
lot of inventory i purchased existing
 
02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:24.230 align:start position:0%
lot of inventory i purchased existing
inventory

02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
inventory
 
02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
i manually put that into the computer i
 
02:41:29.269 --> 02:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
was hoping to get to a shopable website
 
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
thinking some funding would come in but
 
02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's just not in the budget i caught
 
02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:33.510 align:start position:0%
it's just not in the budget i caught
marketing

02:41:33.510 --> 02:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
marketing
 
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
i use my ppp to keep four women employed
 
02:41:39.269 --> 02:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
we cut hours in january and february is
 
02:41:41.110 --> 02:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
to not bleed the payroll till the next
 
02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
ppp comes in
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
um as small business owners already know
 
02:41:48.150 --> 02:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
we work seven days a week
 
02:41:51.110 --> 02:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
and i i can do six days a week here but
 
02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
not seven
 
02:41:53.910 --> 02:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
we used to have four women seven days a
 
02:41:55.990 --> 02:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
week or four people
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
um so my first question
 
02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know not not to be asking
 
02:42:03.030 --> 02:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
rhetorically but to keep moving is you
 
02:42:05.590 --> 02:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
know why may 2019 even in november of
 
02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:06.790 align:start position:0%
know why may 2019 even in november of
2020.

02:42:06.790 --> 02:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
02:42:09.910 --> 02:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
um i had financials to go back to and
 
02:42:11.830 --> 02:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
second there was no robust appeal
 
02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
process there i made two typographical
 
02:42:16.150 --> 02:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
errors and there were it took four weeks
 
02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
to correct that and i was able to
 
02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
correct them
 
02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
but again it came down to the date and i
 
02:42:23.190 --> 02:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
just feel like some of us
 
02:42:24.630 --> 02:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
the new businesses are falling through
 
02:42:27.269 --> 02:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
the cracks and to go back to
 
02:42:29.269 --> 02:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
it was also said purse strings versus
 
02:42:30.309 --> 02:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
heart strings
 
02:42:33.190 --> 02:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
i'm a taxpayer in this state and the
 
02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:33.750 align:start position:0%
i'm a taxpayer in this state and the
country

02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:42:35.670 --> 02:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i would not begrudge anyone
 
02:42:37.750 --> 02:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
receiving any monies
 
02:42:41.110 --> 02:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
um because i'm one of those taxpayers
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
and new businesses are so crucial
 
02:42:48.070 --> 02:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know i'm people were excited to see
 
02:42:49.670 --> 02:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
me take over and add in
 
02:42:52.710 --> 02:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
the inventory that i did um there's room
 
02:42:53.349 --> 02:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
for growth
 
02:42:56.950 --> 02:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
still if i don't make it you will have a
 
02:42:58.710 --> 02:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
corporate hot shop and jewelry store in
 
02:43:00.150 --> 02:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
town i guarantee you because they now
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
know there's room for it because i
 
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
found my niche i grew up from the
 
02:43:05.750 --> 02:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
previous owner the previous owner was
 
02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
here 15 years
 
02:43:10.309 --> 02:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
she that person put this business in
 
02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
yankee magazine polo magazine we're big
 
02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
for derby we're big for easter we're big
 
02:43:15.190 --> 02:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
for bridal
 
02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
so i was affected similar to you know
 
02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:18.230 align:start position:0%
so i was affected similar to you know
event

02:43:18.230 --> 02:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
event
 
02:43:20.830 --> 02:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
people because people weren't going out
 
02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:22.070 align:start position:0%
people because people weren't going out
um

02:43:22.070 --> 02:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:23.670 --> 02:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
and it just would have been nice i'm not
 
02:43:25.670 --> 02:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
i don't want help i don't like
 
02:43:28.870 --> 02:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
asking for help but this is my sole
 
02:43:29.830 --> 02:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
source of income
 
02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
i put like like um mr clark said it's
 
02:43:34.230 --> 02:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
it's sort of my end of life
 
02:43:35.670 --> 02:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
this is what i'm going to do and i work
 
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
hard physically and
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
passionately i'd much rather work with
 
02:43:41.269 --> 02:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
customers than be here
 
02:43:43.269 --> 02:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
because this is public speaking isn't my
 
02:43:44.550 --> 02:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
favorite thing
 
02:43:47.750 --> 02:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
um but i just
 
02:43:50.870 --> 02:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
feel that you know the young the
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
if i have projections for my business
 
02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
that a loan officer and a business
 
02:43:58.309 --> 02:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
valuation could agree to
 
02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
i can also provide that for any
 
02:44:03.030 --> 02:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
financial information and gladly
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
to do so to receive even just a little
 
02:44:06.309 --> 02:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
cushion that
 
02:44:09.910 --> 02:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
sits there just in case a year-long
 
02:44:12.070 --> 02:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic has exhausted anybody's
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
resiliency plan
 
02:44:17.030 --> 02:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
you think three six months okay i i did
 
02:44:18.070 --> 02:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
that i didn't pay myself
 
02:44:19.830 --> 02:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
last winter i haven't paid myself this
 
02:44:22.230 --> 02:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
winter i'm keeping one person employed
 
02:44:24.230 --> 02:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
i'm ready to bring back more
 
02:44:27.910 --> 02:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
um we went curbside i do zooms for
 
02:44:29.429 --> 02:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
people i do private appointments
 
02:44:32.469 --> 02:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
anything i could do to
 
02:44:37.030 --> 02:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
to keep the cash flow going but
 
02:44:39.670 --> 02:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
my december and november were down
 
02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:40.309 align:start position:0%
my december and november were down
fifteen

02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
fifteen
 
02:44:42.550 --> 02:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars i mean i don't i think
 
02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't realize what the
 
02:44:45.429 --> 02:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
shop was doing
 
02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
and because this is a public hearing i'm
 
02:44:48.389 --> 02:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
not i'm not going to discuss that i'm
 
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
happy to provide that to the state
 
02:44:54.150 --> 02:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
um so my third i have two more quick
 
02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:54.870 align:start position:0%
um so my third i have two more quick
questions

02:44:54.870 --> 02:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:44:56.469 --> 02:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
um when they're talking about what
 
02:44:58.070 --> 02:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
funding is coming there's also
 
02:45:01.349 --> 02:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
what could be done with plans for funds
 
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
to redistribute money that might be paid
 
02:45:05.429 --> 02:45:05.439 align:start position:0%
back there are some businesses i'm
 
02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
hearing that have to pay it back because
 
02:45:08.230 --> 02:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
they receive grants from multiple
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
sources i did not
 
02:45:11.910 --> 02:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
um they might have made more money
 
02:45:14.230 --> 02:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
because their industry was more needed
 
02:45:17.429 --> 02:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic so there's maybe a
 
02:45:19.429 --> 02:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
way to funnel the money to us sooner i
 
02:45:20.389 --> 02:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
um and i guess what i woke up in the
 
02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
middle of the night in one of many
 
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
sleepless nights in this past year when
 
02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
i started writing to
 
02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
my governors and my senator my governor
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
and my senators
 
02:45:36.710 --> 02:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
was if i'm not if the people testifying
 
02:45:38.950 --> 02:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
here are not main street as you
 
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
label this grant money then who is
 
02:45:43.670 --> 02:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
and i think some people have answered to
 
02:45:46.389 --> 02:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
that and i don't begrudge the companies
 
02:45:48.469 --> 02:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
who've worked hard but without a year of
 
02:45:51.030 --> 02:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
revenue under my belt
 
02:45:53.269 --> 02:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
i think i've done really well to make my
 
02:45:55.429 --> 02:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
economic injury loan last it's supposed
 
02:45:55.439 --> 02:45:57.110 align:start position:0%
economic injury loan last it's supposed
to

02:45:57.110 --> 02:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:45:59.110 --> 02:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
cover the three months of closure i've
 
02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:00.630 align:start position:0%
cover the three months of closure i've
managed

02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
managed
 
02:46:03.910 --> 02:46:03.920 align:start position:0%

during the pandemic
 
02:50:30.230 --> 02:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
and those who purchased pre-existing
 
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
businesses during the same period
 
02:50:34.830 --> 02:50:34.840 align:start position:0%

02:50:39.429 --> 02:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
as you've heard already this morning
 
02:50:42.150 --> 02:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
than our locally owned small
 
02:50:44.150 --> 02:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial businesses who employ
 
02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
our local residents
 
02:50:47.830 --> 02:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
those who started businesses during this
 
02:50:50.070 --> 02:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
time agonized over business plans and
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
financial projections
 
02:50:53.830 --> 02:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
which were sufficient in most cases to
 
02:50:55.429 --> 02:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
bring to the banks to get the funds for
 
02:50:57.030 --> 02:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
their startups
 
02:50:58.950 --> 02:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
why then would they not also be
 
02:51:00.710 --> 02:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
accommodated in the main street fund
 
02:51:00.720 --> 02:51:02.710 align:start position:0%
accommodated in the main street fund
program

02:51:02.710 --> 02:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:51:04.230 --> 02:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
what if new owners who purchased
 
02:51:06.070 --> 02:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
existing businesses with years of
 
02:51:07.750 --> 02:51:07.760 align:start position:0%

critical funds and yes there was an
 
02:51:21.670 --> 02:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
appeals process which was difficult if
 
02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
not impossible to navigate with business
 
02:51:25.429 --> 02:51:25.439 align:start position:0%

and uh taking the time today uh i pretty
 
02:53:51.510 --> 02:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
much could echo everything that doug
 
02:53:52.150 --> 02:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
clark said
 
02:53:55.030 --> 02:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
i uh purchased a a local thai restaurant
 
02:53:56.630 --> 02:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth new hampshire
 
02:53:59.830 --> 02:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh in uh june of 2019 was opened by
 
02:54:01.349 --> 02:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
december of 2019
 
02:54:03.110 --> 02:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
and then so i had three months of sales
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
before the coveted shutdown on march
 
02:54:05.439 --> 02:54:06.070 align:start position:0%
before the coveted shutdown on march
16th

02:54:06.070 --> 02:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
16th
 
02:54:09.269 --> 02:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
2020. um i guess the only additional
 
02:54:10.469 --> 02:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
point i'd like to make is
 
02:54:13.349 --> 02:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh i'm kind of in a unique situation in
 
02:54:14.950 --> 02:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
portsmouth which is a
 
02:54:16.950 --> 02:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
large um you know tourism accounts for a
 
02:54:18.309 --> 02:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
lot of our uh
 
02:54:21.349 --> 02:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
the local restaurant industry um if you
 
02:54:22.950 --> 02:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
pay attention to the business that
 
02:54:24.950 --> 02:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
businesses that have come and gone
 
02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
since covid uh hit a year ago
 
02:54:32.230 --> 02:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are the larger chains that
 
02:54:35.670 --> 02:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
you know did employ locally but uh
 
02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
that i mean like if if they're a larger
 
02:54:38.790 --> 02:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
chain that
 
02:54:41.190 --> 02:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
has locations from here to atlanta you
 
02:54:42.230 --> 02:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
know they pretty much just look at a
 
02:54:43.670 --> 02:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
balance sheet and then
 
02:54:47.349 --> 02:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh trim the fad for whichever store so
 
02:54:49.510 --> 02:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know wasn't the producer for them so
 
02:54:50.790 --> 02:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
02:54:53.830 --> 02:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
the the larger restaurant groups have as
 
02:54:55.910 --> 02:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
much of a concern for the local economy
 
02:54:59.269 --> 02:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
as a local
 
02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
young business owner like myself i
 
02:55:01.920 --> 02:55:02.950 align:start position:0%
young business owner like myself i
employ

02:55:02.950 --> 02:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
employ
 
02:55:04.550 --> 02:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
everybody lives in the greater
 
02:55:06.630 --> 02:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
portsmouth area that i employ
 
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
and uh and i don't have like an
 
02:55:10.950 --> 02:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
allegiance i guess to um
 
02:55:14.150 --> 02:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere foreign it's just um it's i'm
 
02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
from portsmouth and i
 
02:55:17.429 --> 02:55:17.439 align:start position:0%
want to stay in portsmouth and my
 
02:55:19.429 --> 02:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
business is in portsmouth
 
02:55:22.230 --> 02:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
so i guess if you pay attention to who's
 
02:55:23.349 --> 02:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
02:55:25.510 --> 02:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
to the town uh since all of this it's a
 
02:55:27.590 --> 02:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
lot of larger restaurant groups that
 
02:55:30.710 --> 02:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know could foreseeably do the
 
02:55:32.630 --> 02:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
same thing they're not from here and if
 
02:55:34.710 --> 02:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh if it didn't work out they're they're
 
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
not as invested in the community
 
02:55:39.349 --> 02:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh and then you know they looked at my
 
02:55:41.190 --> 02:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
spot before i opened and
 
02:55:44.070 --> 02:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
i know that they've looked at my spot as
 
02:55:45.590 --> 02:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
coven's hit
 
02:55:49.110 --> 02:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
so um it's you know this bill would help
 
02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:49.670 align:start position:0%
so um it's you know this bill would help
protect

02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
protect
 
02:55:52.469 --> 02:55:52.479 align:start position:0%
uh local i mean it is called main street
 
02:55:54.469 --> 02:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh a main street business that
 
02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm 29 years old and i would like to
