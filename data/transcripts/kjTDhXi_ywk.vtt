for next year that I would appreciate
 
00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:39.309 align:start position:0%
for next year that I would appreciate
co-sponsors

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors
 
00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:42.879 align:start position:0%

for uh the first first two are about
General

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
General
 
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
regulation and cleanup language for
 
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
oplc um anyone who's interested let me
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
know I'll be glad to add you there's
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
another one on for the retirement system
 
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the Restriction of one year
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
of workers comp applying to your
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
um um toward your pension that came up
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
when we had the severely injured
 
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
policeman who said well I would have
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
reached 10 years but I only got credit
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
for one year of being out on workers
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
comp when was actually more like a year
 
00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
and a half so I Mr D yes yes and so I
 
00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
thought that there I can't think of any
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
particular reason why if someone is out
 
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
on workers's comp he shouldn't be
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
included in the pension system for as
 
00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
long as it takes for him to recover so
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
if you're interested in that let me know
 
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
and I'll be glad to add it I'm
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
interested you're in okay
 
00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:52.519 align:start position:0%
good and now look at the
 
00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:55.959 align:start position:0%
language as well all right I will uh
 
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
make a note of that you can put on oh
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
yes please I think it should be uh a few
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
more all right thank you I thought that
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
one would be more
 
00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:11.959 align:start position:0%
popular all right then there's um on
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
Municipal enforcement of building and
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
fire codes which was a request of the
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
building uh building code review
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
board and then there's a student license
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
for Respiratory
 
00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:29.079 align:start position:0%
therapists who are able to start working
 
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
on on some parts of their job before
 
00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
they get their full training and their
 
00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:35.069 align:start position:0%
they get their full training and their
full

00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
license and so this would let them be
 
00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
employed on what they what they have
 
00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:41.190 align:start position:0%
employed on what they what they have
already

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
learned um before before they finish
 
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.630 align:start position:0%
learned um before before they finish
their

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
training so a minor
 
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
one anyone
 
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.470 align:start position:0%
one anyone
else

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%

members for the day at least we have 10
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
quum so I'm opening the executive
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
session on our retained bills and I want
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
to start with House Bill
 
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
1676 which is a sunet commission
 
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:34.750 align:start position:0%
1676 which is a sunet commission
representative

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
broa thank you Madame chair um House
 
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.710 align:start position:0%
broa thank you Madame chair um House
Bill

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
1676 um had to do with the sunsetting
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
Comm of of uh o of um boards and
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
commissions within
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
oplc and the committee I I think the
 
00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:00.519 align:start position:0%
committee's position I believe I'd like
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
to discuss that is that since the
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
introduction of this bill was made last
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
year there's been a lot of changes that
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
have taking place in the office of
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
professional LIC Insurance
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
certification and I think that before we
 
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
look at changing boards and sunsetting
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
some and and
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh sunsetting boards and commissions we
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
should give the organization time
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
to to orient itself and um
 
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.509 align:start position:0%
to to orient itself and um
have

00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
the before further actions is taken on
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
any kind of board structure so at this
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
time I don't think we we should be
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
recommending any further legislation in
 
00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:43.829 align:start position:0%
recommending any further legislation in
this

00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
area that would be my
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:15.829 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
represent the Motions at least seconds
 
00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:21.959 align:start position:0%
I'm I've never been uh never had a
 
00:12:21.959 --> 00:12:24.350 align:start position:0%
I'm I've never been uh never had a
definitive

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
definitive
 
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.189 align:start position:0%
definitive
ruling

00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
ruling
 
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
um oh that's fine we'll uh I I'm not
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
sure it it matters my uh I'd like to say
 
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
on this is that a sunset commission is a
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
to go back and look at what we're doing
 
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
and decide if we still need to do it
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
because there's an awful lot of our laws
 
00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:48.519 align:start position:0%
that haven't been changed in 50
 
00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:50.310 align:start position:0%
that haven't been changed in 50
years

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
and but on the other hand an
 
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
organized review like the sunset
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
commission needs to be supported
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
and so far neither of the candidates for
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
Governor has shown any interest in in
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
doing anything of the sort so I'm not
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
sure I would want to try and impose it
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
at this this
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
else okay in that case the motion is no
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
further not recommended for further
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
legislation and the clerk can call the
 
00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:53.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
we have 10 at the moment but another one
 
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
tell whoever you get to show up when
 
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.389 align:start position:0%
tell whoever you get to show up when
they

00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
you okay got everybody all right vote
 
00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:30.870 align:start position:0%
you okay got everybody all right vote

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
yes and the chair
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
yes T zer all right is if there is there
 
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
any objections to consent if we have
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
one nope not seeing any we'll put that
 
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
right representative uh Shu do you have
 
00:15:23.749 --> 00:15:23.759 align:start position:0%
a motion on House Bill
 
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
1324 yes Madam chair I do um I'll be
 
00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:30.759 align:start position:0%
recommending to not go
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
forward um reason being that um this
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee actually put the bill into
 
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and we heard quite a bit of
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
testimony both at the hearing which was
 
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
quite lengthy and at the
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and then we decided to put
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
it into interim study because there were
 
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
still many questions about the bill that
 
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.590 align:start position:0%
still many questions about the bill that
were

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
unanswered we basically put to the
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh to reach out to the funeral
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
directors uh first I guess I should say
 
00:16:08.189 --> 00:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
that this this was dealing with um the
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
idea of natural organic red reduction of
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
human remains and we heard questions
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
from the Funeral Directors
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
Association and the cemetery
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
Association and also from the dicese of
 
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester of the Catholic church and we
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
basically asked asked the sponsors to
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
reach out to the funeral directors and
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
the cemetery Association to see if they
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
could work out any kind of compromise
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
between what they were saying and what
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
these two groups were saying they saw as
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
concerns with the
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
bill um I reached out last week to Mr
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
Moren uh who represented the funeral
 
00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
directors and to uh the gentleman who
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
represented the cemetery
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
associations and I even checked with uh
 
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
the cemetery committee from my own town
 
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
uh the sponsors had not reached out to
 
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.510 align:start position:0%
uh the sponsors had not reached out to
these

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
folks they did purport that I guess
 
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
seven states in the US have adopted this
 
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
policy uh the one that I could find that
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
had adopted rules was the state of
 
00:17:26.909 --> 00:17:26.919 align:start position:0%
Washington and part of their rules
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
mandated that um
 
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
these remains had to
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
be uh collected if no one claimed them
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
had to be collected in a container or
 
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
many sealed
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
containers uh they also
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
um do advocate for alkaline hydrolysis
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
in Washington which we do not and they
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
put this under that statute according to
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Moren the Funeral Directors
 
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
Association met with um the state of
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
Vermont who has adopted the policy they
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
adopted it two years ago and still have
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
not uh been able to craft rules dealing
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
with it and the main objection with this
 
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
large amount of remains we heard that it
 
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
could be as much as a pickup
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
loadful uh so that's a lot of material
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
to deal with
 
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
and um my point also was that all of our
 
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.350 align:start position:0%
and um my point also was that all of our
Municipal

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:39.799 align:start position:0%
cemeteries would have to adopt some kind
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
of ordinance changes to accommodate
 
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
these kinds of Barrels in their
 
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
facilities So based on the fact that
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
there have been no uh real resolution to
 
00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:52.549 align:start position:0%
there have been no uh real resolution to
these

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
concerns uh I'm recommending not to go
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
forward with this legislation
 
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.669 align:start position:0%
forward with this legislation
all

00:19:02.669 --> 00:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
questions I I Rec agree with
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
representative Shou that we don't need
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
to go forward with this right now it's
 
00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.789 align:start position:0%
to go forward with this right now it's
still

00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:21.799 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
legal for some for a family
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
to to bury someone on their own land
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
with with or without any kind
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
of EMB bombing or or caskets or whatever
 
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
at their choice as long as they just
 
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
notify the town clerk that there is a be
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
a body there and with that in mind and
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
there are natural cemeteries where the
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
same thing can happen so I don't see the
 
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
need for
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
this accelerated process be and at least
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
until they can res solve the issue of
 
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
um having large quantities of of residue
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
that need to be dealt with and it needs
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
to be dealt with in a respectful manner
 
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm I strongly agree we shouldn't go
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
forward with this
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
bill anyone
 
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.470 align:start position:0%

representative

00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:53.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair so I I I
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
think there I agree with repes represent
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
Shu that there are a number of issues
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:06.039 align:start position:0%
unresolved uh but that since there
 
00:21:06.039 --> 00:21:07.029 align:start position:0%
unresolved uh but that since there
clearly

00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
are movements within the the whole
 
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
industry with regard to looking at these
 
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and so forth and the
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
sponsors here um uh so I I think I think
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
it needs to have a natural Evolution
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
rather than being force-fed so to speak
 
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
by by the legislature at this point in
 
00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
my opinion so I'm I'm okay since this
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't bind anybody the sponsor can
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
bring it back on her own if she so
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
chooses um but I'm okay with not
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
recommending it but on the part of the
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
else okay in that case the motion is not
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
recommended for further legislation and
 
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
thought representative Brown is not able
 
00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:00.039 align:start position:0%
to be here and he has told told me he
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
recommends not
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
going he is not recommending for further
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
legislation House Bill
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
1420 that's Communications between
 
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
agencies and
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
citizens is there a
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
second a second okay the the reason is
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
that that is an excellent idea that the
 
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919 align:start position:0%
agency should be responsive to the
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
citizens answer the their phone calls
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
replied to their letters and all that
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
however his bill as written is
 
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
unenforceable and if we tried to enforce
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
it we would have we would be in a
 
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
nightmare of keeping track of phone
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
calls and when the responses were and
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
how the calls got routed if somebody
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
called and didn't know exactly who to
 
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.669 align:start position:0%
called and didn't know exactly who to
speak

00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's we think that's something that the
 
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
managers of each agency should be
 
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.870 align:start position:0%
managers of each agency should be
responsible

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
for and we'll keep an eye on it but it
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
it's not recommended for legislation as
 
00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:15.799 align:start position:0%
such and so I'm that's what the
 
00:24:15.799 --> 00:24:17.909 align:start position:0%
such and so I'm that's what the
recommendation

00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
is anyone else represent schm no oh okay
 
00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:23.909 align:start position:0%
is anyone else represent schm no oh okay
anyone

00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
else I just want to make sure I I I just
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
want the rest the the the newer members
 
00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
of the committee to um realize that the
 
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
request was that they had to respond
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
within three business
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
days which was in some
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
cases difficult if every single call had
 
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
to be handled that way so since there
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
was no priorities or
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
or uh description further than that that
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
was the issue as well
 
00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
yes and and of course there are always
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
cas of well
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr Brown knows all the answers and
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
he'll be glad to talk to you as soon as
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
he gets back from his Hospital stay or
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
his uh or his vacation or whatever
 
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
there's there was no
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility and keeping track of it to
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that it happened would be a
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
nightmare I I don't think it's workable
 
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
I just
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
exactly all right so anyone
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
else those in favor uh the clerk can
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%

00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
110 the motion passes any objections to
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
consent okay representative
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
one thank you madam chair I would like
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
to move uh no uh no future or no further
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh legislation on HB 1653
 
00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:32.549 align:start position:0%
uh legislation on HB 1653
call

00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
second 1653 yes here to speak on it uh
 
00:26:39.149 --> 00:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
sure so um this bill uh is one of many
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
bills that we've heard over the last
 
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
couple years um pertaining to um
 
00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
benefits uh retirement benefits for
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
group two
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
employees especially those who um
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
commenced work prior to July 1st 2011
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
but hadn't been vested by 200 uh
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
whatever it was 12 uh 12
 
00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
um and uh a lot of work has gone into it
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh this year we were able to pass into
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
law hb1 1647 which addresses um the
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
content of this bill and so um further
 
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
consideration I think would be
 
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
unworkable Pro potentially redundant um
 
00:27:17.389 --> 00:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
since this has already become law and
 
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
all of the parties that were involved
 
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
seem to be okay with the way things
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
turned out so um for those reasons I'll
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
say that we probably shouldn't be
 
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
pushing for further legislation at this
 
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.950 align:start position:0%
pushing for further legislation at this
time

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
representive brto the committee received
 
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
three similar bills and the one that we
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
chose to go forward with was
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
1647 and so since that one was the the
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle by which we had a tremendous
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
amount of negotiations within the house
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
and then within the Senate um we really
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
I I know that at this time any other uh
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
retirement bills that are similar to
 
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
that should not be
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
entertained so I agree okay anyone else
 
00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
discussion okay that case the motion is
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
not recommended for further legislation
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
and the clerk can call the
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%

legislation on 1673 uh for all the
 
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
reasons just stated on 1653 that's the
 
00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.029 align:start position:0%
reasons just stated on 1653 that's the
same

00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%

also
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%

identical

11 it's all right clerks are notorious
 
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
for skipping the chairs it's cuz they
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
put you on the top where you belong but
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%

consent

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
okay hoping representative gold would be
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
here representative bro did you have
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
another rep motion
 
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
um I have a motion for House Bill 1689
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
relative to the use of personal
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
identification information by state
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
agencies okay and we recommend no no uh
 
00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
no further legislation on this I'll
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
explain to you the committee we are all
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
concerned with the privacy of
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
identification information within state
 
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
agencies I think it's something that we
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
should be all on our radar but we are
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
also concerned that this bill
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
particularly conflict with the
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
legislative requirements that we placed
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
on agencies such as the Department of
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and we feel
 
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
that well I was thinking my
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation be that the committee
 
00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:10.039 align:start position:0%
feels that before further legislation
 
00:31:11.629 --> 00:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
put forward the nature of this
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
legislation on agencies on agencies as
 
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
well analyzed and understood by the
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
bills um is there a second I'll second
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
you comments
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
pres Bolton you're free to speak if you
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
like sure thank you madam chair and um I
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
would agree that this bill needs to be
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
reworked um I intend to go forward with
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
a another bill this next year and I
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
would appreciate um ultimately when this
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
bill we discuss the bill and vote on it
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
but um I would like to have any sponsors
 
00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:53.799 align:start position:0%
to be on on the bill so that we can do
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
I strongly support that sentiment that
 
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
we should get the bills right before
 
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.590 align:start position:0%
we should get the bills right before
submitting

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
submitting
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
them any other
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
comments all right cler can call the
 
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:start position:0%

00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
okay it's that passes 11 to zero any
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
objection to
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
consent okay we will try
 
00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:49.310 align:start position:0%
consent okay we will try
consent

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.789 align:start position:0%
consent
yes

00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.799 --> 00:32:55.190 align:start position:0%
 
ENT

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
ENT
 
00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
certainly you
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay hi um I would like to make a motion
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
of uh on House Bill 1333 which is
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
relative to the prohibition of state
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
agencies from buying or leasing electric
 
00:33:13.149 --> 00:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
fleet vehicles for 10
 
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
years so all uh and my my recommendation
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
will be that no further legislation is
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
taken on this
 
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
um so there is a concern by some that
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
and by many on electric vehicles however
 
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
I think that state
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
agencies prohibiting state agencies from
 
00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
making their own decisions on this kind
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
of matter is not the in the purview of
 
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature and also to come up with
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
a number of 10 years it seems also
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
random so for these two reasons I don't
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
think that we should that this type of
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
legislation should not be
 
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
entertained in the next
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
session all right it does is there a
 
00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.789 align:start position:0%
session all right it does is there a
second

00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
second by representative
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
Schmid okay any other comments
 
00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:04.110 align:start position:0%
Schmid okay any other comments
representative

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair I know that
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh electric vehicles sometimes get
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
caught up in the Whirlwind of debate
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
over climate change uh issues um but I
 
00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
agree with with representative gerto
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
that I don't think any further um
 
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
legislation should be recommended at
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
this time simply for the fact that we
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
have absolutely no idea what kind of
 
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
innovation will take place over the next
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
10 years uh I know that the prime
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill um mentioned things
 
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
such as our electrical grid and capacity
 
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
um but we don't know whether or not the
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
capacity required to charge these
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles over the next 10 years is going
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
to decline rapidly um expense might
 
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
decline rapidly and I know there were
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
safety concerns over battery use um but
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
those also might stabilize over the next
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
10 years and so we don't want to
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
handicap our agencies from being able to
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
make those kind of decisions at those
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
times I think um all of our jobs in the
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
government is to make the um best
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
decisions that we can with the
 
00:34:57.069 --> 00:34:57.079 align:start position:0%
information that we have in the moment
 
00:34:59.230 --> 00:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
um and so I I assume that's what we'll
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
do now and also over the course of the
 
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
next 10 years so I just don't want to
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
hamstring anybody from uh by being too
 
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
shortsighted in in the
 
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
moment and I'd like to add that this
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
year we also created a commission of
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
various stakeholders to consider the
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
safety and cost effectiveness of
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
electrical cars and they're working on
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
it I wouldn't want
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
to Short Circuit their deliberations by
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
saying we can't buy any cuz I'm I'm sure
 
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
there are some some situations where
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
electrical vehicles are appropriate in
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
state fleets and they and I trust the
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
agencies to figure it out for
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
themselves anyone
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
else representative Schmid I mean these
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
last two remarks are especially uh the
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
millstone around the neck of this
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
proposal you know to try to tie hands
 
00:35:58.109 --> 00:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
for 10 years completely unwise something
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's developing as rapidly as AVS are
 
00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
and chair's remarks are equally
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate so we're going in the right
 
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
direction thank you anyone
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
else okay the clerk can call the rule
 
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
the motion is not recommended for
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%

a all
 
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
right 11 to zero is any objections to
 
00:36:47.069 --> 00:36:47.079 align:start position:0%
consent seeing none we'll do that if
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
there is one all right what do we got
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
here I was expecting representative gold
 
00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:56.839 align:start position:0%
to be here but in her place I will move
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
1679 Atlantic time to not recommended
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
for further
 
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
second second
 
00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.470 align:start position:0%
second second
okay

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
and the point of this is that New
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a very small
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
state we don't really want to be out of
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
sync with our
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
neighbors what we we need a federal or
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
at least a Regional approach to time we
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
and so until and unless Congress
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
Acts or even better than that you know
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
all the New England
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
states we don't want we need to be with
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
our neighbors on time it's it's
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
ridiculous to think that we would have
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
our a separate time zone and
 
00:37:56.349 --> 00:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
um uh I don't think we should waste our
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
legislator's time
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
in trying to deal with this again
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
however nice it would be because we're
 
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
not going to go alone on this
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
one anyone else
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%

00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:14.599 align:start position:0%

a
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
motion thank you um Madam chair for
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
reasons that I stated earlier on House
 
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
Bill let me see if I can remember that
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
pH um house bills
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
1676 I recommend that we don't further
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
review the um conversion combination of
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
reorganization of boards and advisory
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
boards furthermore we took the parts of
 
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
this bill you might might well some of
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
you will not know this but this
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
committee had um retained House Bill 12
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
71 and during the course of the Year
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
during the session we um attached the
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
parts that the
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
committee had not objected to onto
 
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
another bill which the governor vetoed
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
and we could not override the vetto last
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
week so um and it included the
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
combination of some of the boards since
 
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
then we've learned that some of the
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
individuals on for example the
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
acupuncture an Asian art board did not
 
00:40:04.109 --> 00:40:04.119 align:start position:0%
want to be an Advisory Board and also
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
um so I'm recommending that we don't we
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
just start a new and we don't
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
particularly reintroduce this bill next
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
year okay is there a
 
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
Schmidt okay any repres Schmid do you
 
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
else okay if no one wants to represent
 
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.790 --> 00:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
comment okay that's no so the motion is
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%

consent okay all right the last one my
 
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
God we're moving right along is House
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 1408 reorganization of various
 
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.550 align:start position:0%
Bill 1408 reorganization of various
boards

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
and on the advice of Representative gold
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to move that it is recommended
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
for further legislation
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
on one specific
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
Foresters has a requirement for a public
 
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:09.079 align:start position:0%
member that is not involved in the
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
forestry business and they have a great
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
deal of trouble filling that board
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
filling that position and they would
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
like to have another land owner or
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
Timber owner on the board so she is
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
recommending that
 
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
we uh move that forward because the
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
board composition is specified in
 
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
law and
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
so uh I will make that motion on her
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
behalf is there a
 
00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.670 align:start position:0%
behalf is there a
second

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
okay does anyone have a comment question
 
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.109 align:start position:0%
okay does anyone have a comment question
or

00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
discussion I do have a comment because
 
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
and I I'll I'll support the um the
 
00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.510 align:start position:0%
and I I'll I'll support the um the
recommendation

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that there would be
 
00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.870 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that there would be
many

00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
more non Foresters in New Hampshire than
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
Foresters so I'm surprised that that
 
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
position is difficult to fill and why do
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
we have non we do oftentimes have public
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
members that are not related to the
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
field itself for nonbiased for biased
 
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
reasons so um I just would be more I
 
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
I'll be those are the types of things
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
I'll be interested in knowing if the
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
legislation is brought
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
forward that I'm trust we will give it
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
scrutiny all right any other comments
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
questions okay that case the clerk can
 
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
call the
 
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
role represent Simon yes representative
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
