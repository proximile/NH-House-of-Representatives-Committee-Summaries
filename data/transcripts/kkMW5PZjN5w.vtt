previous from in the from the previous
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
work session the discussions were on
 
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.309 align:start position:0%
work session the discussions were on
2272

00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
2272
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
H uh 2273 H and 2274 H so uh the
 
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
2272 H was amendments to line 7 through
 
00:15:52.309 --> 00:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
9 and line
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
26 uh which is
 
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative yes the underlying
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
Bill removes the 80% so what does this
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
do differently uh no this is just um
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
remov to 80% and then it's on line 26 as
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
an additional um Amendment there to
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
apply that removal of the 80% to nonc
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
cor organizations as
 
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.670 align:start position:0%
cor organizations as
well

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
yep representative Aly thank you on I'm
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
still not quite understanding
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
on there is added in a reference to to
 
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
a120 which
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
um is apparently what is referred to in
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
as adjust and adjusted which I don't
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
didn't understand why that was there at
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
all on and on
 
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
a120 is just say referring specifically
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
to the section that says that we are
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
2018 uh representative are you referring
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
to the 2272
 
00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:20.039 align:start position:0%
H uh yeah wasn't that what you were just
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
talking about yes right so the the am
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment to line 26 is just to
 
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
encapsulate the uh to make sure that the
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
removal of the 80% does apply to the
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
well I didn't even see that in in
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
20 where does that show up in the
 
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
law that that they don't apply to the C
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
Corp to the nonse Corp the the federal
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
IRC uh 172 uh sorry the federal IRC uh n
 
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
deduction uh it is this IC 172 uh is
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
applicable to C Corps only and so uh
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
because in New Hampshire with all the
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
business organizations no matter C cor
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
or LLC or or what have you um so I
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
treated equally and the attempt on line
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
26 is just to make sure that it's clear
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
that this removal of the 80% cap as an
 
00:18:26.909 --> 00:18:26.919 align:start position:0%
adjustment as opposed to a limited you
 
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
know so the original language here is uh
 
00:18:33.149 --> 00:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
n as limited by the section so right now
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
the removal of 80% cap is not really a
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
limitation it's more of an adjustment so
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's why we thought that having this
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
language here would make it
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
clearer um and it's just to clarify that
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
that that it is in fact treated equally
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
across businesses somewhere in
 
00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
A1 or somewhere in our code right the
 
00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
the removal of the 80% cap is when it
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
says that U uh except in determining the
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
amount of the an deduction a business
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
organization shall not be subject to any
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
taxable income
 
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
limitation uh under the
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
172 right but I'm I'm asking about the
 
00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:18.350 align:start position:0%
172 right but I'm I'm asking about the
nonse

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
nonse
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
corpse where is that found in
 
00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
our uh no so we we don't have that um so
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
but it's on the Federal Federal IRC
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
yeah oh well so I'll I take it for
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
granted that's that works I guess okay
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
all right continue all right uh so that
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
was uh two 2272
 
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
H so for Amendment 2273 H the amendment
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
was on line 14 which is the change in
 
00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the limitation of the NL
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
carryover limited to 10 years extended
 
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
years representative Aly thank you so
 
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
we're about to switch a lot of the
 
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
people that are paying
 
00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:18.919 align:start position:0%
BPT and we'll have a lot of new people
 
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
who are paying it who weren't paying or
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
some at least weren't paying it before
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
the way this is going to work is that
 
00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.590 align:start position:0%
the way this is going to work is that
their

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
Federal um
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
Federal losses will be carried with them
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
to us from the past yes so um so this
 
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
that was the the discussion in the last
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
work session was with the change from
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
the 10 years to 20 years how about those
 
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
uh business organizations were just on
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
the border and then now it's being
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
extended 20 years so that's when uh this
 
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
is that's being addressed with the new
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
Amendment um
 
00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559 align:start position:0%
2290 h I I don't have a copy of that
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'm sorry we don't have yeah
 
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
you the only one with a copy we could
 
00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
have this copy
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
um right so
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
2290 uh makes it clear that for taxable
 
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
periods ending on or after December 31st
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
2024 net operating losses can be carried
 
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
forward for 20 years so that implies
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
that previous to that those losses can
 
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:27.799 align:start position:0%
only go 10 years correct so that's
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's the change of this it was that
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
was a question I don't know if you
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
brought it up or somebody brought up
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
last time yeah what happens to those
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
people that are in the midst of a
 
00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
10-year carry forward and suddenly it's
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
20 so so really
 
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
2273 obsolete in the sense or or it
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
clarifies 2273 so it's even if we
 
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
decided we wanted all these things 2290
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
is the clarification right of 20
 
00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.029 align:start position:0%
is the clarification right of 20
273

00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay okay and and so businesses that we
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
never taxed before but they're selling
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
into New
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um right now would be carrying
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
their their uh loss records from from
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
the federal government uh with them to

us and we abandon anything before
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
years when we're calculating
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
until we get 10 years out and everybody
 
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:37.400 align:start position:0%

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
page um I'm I'm not getting that part
 
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:42.760 align:start position:0%

before but do qualify now we are told
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
that there at least going to be some of
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
them to replace the money losing from a
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
lot of other
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.149 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
point that you mentioned the word

obsolete for uh 73h is that or are you
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
saying that well it's it's not obsolete
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
but 2290 attempts to clarify
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
2273 thank
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%

have used the full 10 years for net
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
operating losss carry forward uh we we
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
tried to research on that um we are not
 
00:24:26.669 --> 00:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
able to come up with uh with a
 
00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:29.559 align:start position:0%
definitive answer uh this the the
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
collection of the data does not track
 
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.310 align:start position:0%
collection of the data does not track
that

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.710 align:start position:0%
 
way

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
s uh Sarah um representative
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
ORS thank you Mr chair so uh thank you
 
00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so do we have an
 
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
idea which businesses would impact New
 
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and what the dollar uh impact
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
might be uh we we do have an idea on the
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts but which businesses uh
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
to all all businesses are able to uh to
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
claim the netet uh n deductions so in
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
on so I'm referring to the uh the tax
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
expenditure report that uh the latest
 
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
sex expenditure report that was sent out
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
uh this was uh prepared in December of
 
00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
22 uh every year the Dr prepares a tax
 
00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
expenditure report uh and issues it in
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
in December time frame uh so the uh the
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
latest one that's out there is the
 
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
December 22 report and for fiscal year
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
22 uh the net operating
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
loss that the the tax that's decreased
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
by the usage of net operating loss was
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
274 so uh Amendment 2274 is an amendment
 
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
to remove the uh the $10 million cap on
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
the carry forwards as it's currently the
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
N deductions carry over uh limited to
 
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
$10 million uh so this amendment uh is
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
questions yeah represent Aly it's just
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
on I think I remember that that we have
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
no way of knowing how much loss we'd be
 
00:26:46.919 --> 00:26:47.789 align:start position:0%
no way of knowing how much loss we'd be
be

00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:47.799 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
seeing that we'd have to pay for if um
 
00:26:55.149 --> 00:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
if we do this yes that's correct uh we
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately we are not able to
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
information thank you Mr chairman yes Mr
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
Mr Wong uh then are you saying that it's
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
the federal amount that we would use
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
unlimited if this is
 
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.789 align:start position:0%
unlimited if this is
[Music]

00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
removed that that is correct um so the
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers who are claiming net
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
operating losses they will be um if just
 
00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.039 align:start position:0%
only this amendment uh they'll be
 
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
claiming whatever losses they can claim
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
in the any current year but then if they
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
have access losses they'll continue to
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
carry it over to the following year and
 
00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
then um and then but that access carry
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%

uh on a three-day trip at this point
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
business trip uh
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
and we have been working um he has been
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
working especially with the agriculture
 
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
Department uh I think we have someone
 
00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
here yes you uh and there have you got
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
the latest version of the amendment
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday's Okay so so I would like to
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
go into the audience and uh also
 
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519 align:start position:0%
talk um what about this but um the
 
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
situation is that we have an amendment
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
which he sent in draft form but it was a
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
little too drafty uh to on OSS and asked
 
00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:23.519 align:start position:0%
them to get it out by yesterday and they
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
did and he looked at it as he was
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
leaving and and uh rewrote it um
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
fortunately just before he left uh and
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
sent it back to them to redraft and I
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
have what he sent which I read and it
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
looks pretty much like what we all had
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
agreed to do on we discussed this also
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
in dedicated funds yesterday the chair
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
and I were both are both on that
 
00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
committee um on
 
00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.710 align:start position:0%
committee um on
and

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
on there's a certain amount of mess
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
involved in this part of the
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
departmental structure and this cleans
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
it up better than if we tried to do it
 
00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:16.039 align:start position:0%
through dedicated funds and it is the
 
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
same subject the for everybody else the
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
the problem is that uh representative
 
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
Bixby was interested in having uh more
 
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
fertilizer and lming and other testing
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
done because there's almost nothing so
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
the consumers both um of nurseries and
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
of of um on for agricultural purposes
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
have no guarantee that the products
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
being sold in this state are what they
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
say they are um which is a kind of a
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
central function under the Department of
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and so he put in a bill that
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
creates a new dedicated fund just to do
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
that the trouble is there is another
 
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund with too much money in it
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
at the moment which um does
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
that which is supposed to do that and
 
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
which in the compendium of dedicated
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
funds the department states that we all
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
think that we ought to be doing a lot
 
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
more with fertilizing and liing and that
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff testing so
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
um we've been working to replace the
 
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.350 align:start position:0%
um we've been working to replace the
bill

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
with making sure that that is actually
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
done inside of the dedicated fund it's
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to be done in and uh and
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
revising that dedicated fund so that it
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
doing so uh that's what this is I would
 
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
like to be able to pull it out and maybe
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
you can talk while I'm doing
 
00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
that director can you introduce
 
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
yourself my name is Alan Wyman with the
 
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets and
 
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
food I am the division director of
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory services and responsible for
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
the oversight of these programs we're
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
discussing here associated with this
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
bill I think representative alamy stated
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
it fairly clearly um there's not much
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
more I can add other than to say that
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
rules and reg well the regulations and
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
rules preate
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
1985 over time things have gotten
 
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
somewhat squirly as a director I'm
 
00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out you know what uh
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to make sure the money could
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
be tracked as it should be and this
 
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
helps to clean up everything I I um the
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
purpose of moving these closing these
 
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:54.519 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds putting in a separate
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
Simplicity and and tracking better
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
better use of the fund actually better
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
use of the funds for the purpose for
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
which they were they are being um uh
 
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.790 align:start position:0%
which they were they are being um uh
gathered

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
so so does this proposed amendment
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
create a new dedicated
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
fund no what we're trying to do here is
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
is put it into a an a pre-existing
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund but that pre-existing
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund has a name that doesn't
 
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
really match the purpose of the fund I
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
don't know how that long ago that
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
happened or why but it's time to to
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
clean it up and make sure that that the
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
funding is going into the correct
 
00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund with the correct name for
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
the correct purposes uh I mean it's all
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
working that way now but it's so
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
scattered that it's not clear this this
 
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
represent I I don't see the name of the
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
old fund so it's clear that the new name
 
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
is replacing the old fund's name that is
 
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
that is correct how do I know that's not
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
creating another fund uh BEC BEC it's
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
intended to replace the old fund with a
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
different name name so this this this is
 
00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.190 align:start position:0%
different name name so this this this is
going

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
to um it's going to what we currently
 
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
call the scale testing fund
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
the scale testing fund has nothing to do
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
with scale testing it has to do with
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
product registration which is what this
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
this money is for uh the purpose of the
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
money gathered that's being moved to the
 
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
scale testing fund is for product
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
registration inspection sampling
 
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
um so in the process of trying to clean
 
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
things up we also thought it made sense
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
to to correct and there's another bill
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
that will correct the or I say correct
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
but change the scale testing fund to
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
product rist ation
 
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
um so that's more reflective of of what
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
is actually those funds are are are
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
being used
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
for follow up it yes 43520 I should look
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
it up with now but that refers to a
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
scale testing fund so with the amend
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
43520 it now says agricultural products
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
regulatory fund it will be clear that
 
00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
the new name is the same fund with a
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
different name I hope so that's the
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
point and that's the purpose um you know
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process and
 
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
however this manages to flow through
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
that process at the end of the day we're
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
going to have one fund product
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
registration fund used to be called the
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
scale testing fund um and this money is
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
going there all this should not be
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
creating any additional funds it should
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
funds I don't you know relative to the
 
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
legislative process and how those name
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
changes occur I I don't understand
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
that what is what do why that's why I
 
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
asked the question what is preventing us
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
from um I think representative Aly
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um the current
 
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
fund is supposed to do product testing
 
00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
what is what is stopping us from doing
 
00:37:15.319 --> 00:37:16.470 align:start position:0%
what is what is stopping us from doing
product

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
testing so I I came into the division
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
approximately two years ago now when I
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
got in uh I noted as I think everybody
 
00:37:26.309 --> 00:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
already understood that a lot of this
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
testing hadn't been done for quite some
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
time and from my perspective looking in
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh being fairly new to this position
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
what I saw was an extraordinar amount of
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
time being taken up in in in two aspects
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
the organic program takes a significant
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
amount of staff time I don't think years
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
ago that was the case but the program
 
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.630 align:start position:0%
ago that was the case but the program
has

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
exploded um and feed and fertilizer uh
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
registrations where I have two people
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
who sit for months in putting in
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
information into a database which they
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
should be out there doing sampling and
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
inspection so simultaneous to this we
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
also have talks going on to butress off
 
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
the animal industry's database to try to
 
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
create a database in which those two
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
people could spend significantly less
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
time at a desk in putting information
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
and going out and doing sampling and so
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
forth so it's it's a we're we're trying
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
to process things in a way that creates
 
00:38:22.589 --> 00:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
significantly greater efficiencies in
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
the division using taxpayers dollars you
 
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
know um and I just don't
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
from again from my perspective coming in
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
from the private sector these were
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies I saw immediately that
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
probably have been in place for well
 
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
they've been in place for decades so
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of like let's clean
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
things up let's get things efficient
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
let's bring budgets into accounts where
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
they truly belong call them what they
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
truly do and and that just makes life
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
easier certainly for me and it allows us
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
to to focus um our our Personnel where
 
00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.510 align:start position:0%
to to focus um our our Personnel where
they

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:03.030 align:start position:0%
they
belong

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
representa

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.950 align:start position:0%
 
Aly

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you on I promised
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby that I'd speak
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
about the bill on the this is the way he
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
he did it he did not take the time that
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
the drafter is taking now to um modify
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
the existing language he just
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
removed uh the words product testing and
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
product and scale testing uh it has a
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
variety of names of that sort uh
 
00:39:58.349 --> 00:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
throughout and it the purposes of the
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
fund are not uh explained except by the
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
title in the rsas right
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
now on but the it is within the
 
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.950 align:start position:0%
now on but the it is within the
agricultural

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
uh part of the rsas and it was always
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
meant to be dealing with testing of
 
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
agricultural products which included
 
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
udes the livestock agricult in
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
agriculture uh and that is why part of
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
the money is coming
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
from dog
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
licenses um because they are also
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
supposed to be testing dog food products
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that's also not going
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
on on and the scale part of it nobody
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
can figure out as he said but where that
 
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
came from but it hasn't been done in the
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
memory of anybody that's in agriculture
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
at this point so um what the existing
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
language says on which will will be
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
are now
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
in uh now coming into that
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
fund and the other two four uh 4314 and
 
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.710 align:start position:0%
fund and the other two four uh 4314 and
six

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
are pretty
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
small about
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
$300,000 a year I think on that will be
 
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
added into it to help pay for the
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
fertilizer the other problem with this
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
fund is that
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
it has over
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
a um endof year balance of over a
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars that is always there and
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
their revenues and their expenses pretty
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
much equal each other but that is before
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
they do the fertilizer testing and a lot
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
of what it's doing is paying for on the
 
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.910 align:start position:0%
of what it's doing is paying for on the
20th

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
20th
 
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
century um
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
data uh early 20th iny data collection
 
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
and um and
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
registration rather than computerization
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
they are now trying to spread
 
00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:41.079 align:start position:0%
computerization of all of their
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
registration um around the department
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
into databases but they're start they've
 
00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
been starting with the animal products
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
one that the um the commissioner got
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
through last
 
00:42:56.839 --> 00:42:58.390 align:start position:0%
through last
year

00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh which is just starting to be built so
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
we're in the early stages of coming into
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
the 21st century in the agriculture
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
Department uh so it also says which will
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
shall be credited to
 
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.349 align:start position:0%
shall be credited to
the

00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
uh Agricultural and scale testing I
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
can't remember exactly what
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
Horticultural and scale testing I don't
 
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
know where the Horticultural part came
 
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.790 align:start position:0%
know where the Horticultural part came
from

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
but uh except that it's part of
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
Agriculture uh and it will be credited
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
to the that the Agriculture and scale
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
testing fund and the drafter will x that
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
out and put in in bold the agricultureal
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
products regulatory fund which a after a
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
fair amount of discussion inside of the
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
department they decided was the best way
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
to call this because it's what they
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
really meant it to be
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
doing or what they think they've really
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
meant it to be doing for quite some time
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
now so um that's uh that goes throughout
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
here and most of this is just on
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
renaming this
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
fund on getting it straight in the 612
 
00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
set ction which is U the dedicated funds
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
and adding those two
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
small um oh an
 
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.950 align:start position:0%
small um oh an
adding

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
adding
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
purpose which is is on the back there
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the fund uh in the second
 
00:44:50.589 --> 00:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
to last paragraph is the first time that
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the fund is being put
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
into the law which would be very helpful
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
I think for the future
 
00:45:01.549 --> 00:45:01.559 align:start position:0%
uh and uh when he he says uh including
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
the inspection sampling and testing of
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
commercial feed parenthesis
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
43519 that's going to come back from the
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
drafter as something
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.119 --> 00:45:20.109 align:start position:0%
 
4359

00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
4359
 
00:45:20.119 --> 00:45:22.470 align:start position:0%
4359
um

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
and and most of the rest of it is
 
00:45:25.319 --> 00:45:27.309 align:start position:0%
and and most of the rest of it is
changing

00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
the name of
 
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
it and uh establishing the linkage with
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
612 but it does it does what
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby and the uh
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee which passed this
 
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
over to us uh wanted to
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
do uh in that fund is to return it to
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
the purpose that they thought it had had
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
for quite some time and and start the
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
process of of
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh creating the databases that they need
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
in this area as well as as a few other
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
areas I think under your your section so
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
that the agriculture staff can do what
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to be doing which is
 
00:46:23.309 --> 00:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
out in the
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
field okay now excuse me uring plants so
 
00:46:29.549 --> 00:46:29.559 align:start position:0%
yesterday we we learned that uh was it
 
00:46:33.309 --> 00:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
250,000 that was in the budget for the
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
database um does that um does that not
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
free up people
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
director you want or do you want me to
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
do that it's that do you think that's a
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
more legislative or well I could tell
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
you that the
 
00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
250,000 uh is uh more specific to I
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
think the animal industry's database and
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
in their division
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
um we have also the weights and measures
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
which is in desperate need desperate
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
need more probably than anybody uh my
 
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
division also needs a database structure
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
and uh Pier's group uh planted the trees
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
as well um we're still working with uh
 
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
pesticides to figure out what their
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
needs are but that 250 is is for
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
specific to the standing up a DayDay
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
base for animal
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
industry okay so this I'll get you in a
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
minute um so this the original bill
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
created a new dedicated fund correct so
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
now this amendment which is it'll
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
replace all replaces the replace all so
 
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
now we're no longer creating a new
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund we are
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
redefining changing changing the title
 
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
of the current dedicated fund and also
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
being specific on what the dedicated
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
doing okay representative PL will we get
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment in time to handle L
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
today I have Karen trying to work on
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
that but I think he probably sent it to
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
him about the same time he sent this to
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
me which was around 5:00 yesterday
 
00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure whether we could do it
 
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
today or not but the other thing is I
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
think this needs a um public
 
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
hearing so it would have to be done with
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
the next meeting whenever we're going to
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
be able to do that which I think is also
 
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.270 align:start position:0%
be able to do that which I think is also
a

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
problem but we have until the 17th of
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
November for
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
these except that the chair's go leaving
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.030 align:start position:0%
for a
while

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
um director Allen I guess if this
 
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
um if this was not passed what what is
 
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
because we have uh right right now if if
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
if if these funds are transferred over
 
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
to what will be called the product
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory um we'll we'll have Equity
 
00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
between input and output uh the fees
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
coming in in in and the cost going out
 
00:49:19.079 --> 00:49:20.309 align:start position:0%
coming in in in and the cost going out
we

00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
have so theoretically it would be
 
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
problematic into the next budgetary
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
cycle but we have a buffer here in this
 
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
in this budget um that we're hoping to
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
put towards the it upgrades uh so I
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
don't know which which are in process
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
and are going to take time so if it
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass this cycle is it going to
 
00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
be a huge deal I I don't think so um but
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's the situation we're in
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're we're Equity right now between
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
what's coming in what's coming out uh we
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
have a bit of a buffer we're hoping that
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
buffer can be used towards the it
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
upgrades uh for freeing up staff to do
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to be
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
doing what is your what is your buffer
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
right now it was
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
1.7 million was it I one and a half give
 
00:50:09.069 --> 00:50:09.079 align:start position:0%
or take yes um yeah I think that
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
250,000 is coming out of you know and
 
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:13.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not yeah it's coming out of that so
 
00:50:15.789 --> 00:50:15.799 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be probably less than
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
1.5 somewhere 1.45 something of that H
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
once the 250 comes
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
out okay representative Aly if I could
 
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
answer that only I think that the major
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
implication would be that for another
 
00:50:35.549 --> 00:50:35.559 align:start position:0%
two years we're not going to um they
 
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
won't be
 
00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.589 align:start position:0%
won't be
testing

00:50:38.589 --> 00:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
fertilizer uh dog
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
food on all the other animal food
 
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
products as well and and they will be
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
mostly sitting at their desks inputting
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
data when they could be starting to move
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
out into the field and act acting like a
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
Agriculture representative
 
00:51:05.069 --> 00:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
bames I just wanted to say first it
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
looks like uh some hard work has been
 
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
done here and it's just straightening
 
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
things out basically this that's that's
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about and um if it
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
takes a public hearing I guess because
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
it's not in Germain is not the idea um
 
00:51:22.589 --> 00:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
so be it we we've got uh where are we
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
we're mid October now we've got till mid
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
no November we should be able to manage
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
done representative ORS uh thank you Mr
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
chair so uh thanks for taking my
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
question would you be able to move a
 
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
clerical position into inputting in the
 
00:51:46.589 --> 00:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
database and let these people get out to
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
the field I figure they're certified
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
or they're trained to do the testing
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so we do have a
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
data Clerk and when this program started
 
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
my only guess is because I wasn't around
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
when it was started but from the
 
00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
information I see in the data I've
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
witnessed historically
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
this program has exploded so now it's
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's taking our our data Clerk and our
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
inspector to do that work um it it's a
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
lot under the division just things have
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lee
 
00:52:34.829 --> 00:52:34.839 align:start position:0%
Lee thank you um I just want to thank
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
the director for all of the work that I
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
think it would be very daunting to walk
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
into a job and be like oh this hasn't
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
been updated for 30 years so I just want
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
to say thank you um I think that our
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
citizens expect that the state is doing
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
this work and I want to thank you for
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
for bringing to our attention mention
 
00:52:58.109 --> 00:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
that it that it's not and sounds like
 
00:52:59.309 --> 00:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
funds are
 
00:53:03.069 --> 00:53:03.079 align:start position:0%
appropriated um just bureaucracy and
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
time has gotten in the way so I really
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate you bringing this to us and I
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
hope that we won't slow this down but um
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
speed it up and get this work done
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
because I know for me if you if we bring
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
this back in a year I'm going to be like
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
what and so I know for myself I would
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
have to redo a lot of the mental work to
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
understand so I hope that we can T can
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
get this done and serve the people in
 
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
the way that we're supposed to so thank
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
you so much for all of the extra work to
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
to call attention to this and bring it
 
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.160 --> 00:54:05.230 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
306 I'll close the um public hearing on
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
HP 494 um not public hearing we'll close
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
494

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
494
 
00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
that's what you wanted had unfortunately
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
it we're just going to wait uh a minute
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
to get um representative Jordan down
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.000 --> 00:59:25.270 align:start position:0%
 
Eller

00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to open the work session on
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
S SP
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
112 and Senator Lang you have um a
 
00:59:36.119 --> 00:59:48.870 align:start position:0%
112 and Senator Lang you have um a
proposed

00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.029 --> 00:59:51.039 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:59:53.029 --> 00:59:53.039 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm passing
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
around an amendment that I draft
 
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
although it's a senate Amendment if you
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
guys choose to go forward with it you'd
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
have to have it redrafted as a house
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
amendment to adopt it um the amendment
 
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
goes back to our favorite conversation
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
point of historic horse raising and
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
moratoriums um so I I've been working
 
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
with various um individuals and entities
 
01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
to try to get to a place where we can
 
01:00:15.309 --> 01:00:15.319 align:start position:0%
all come to an agreement whether that be
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the executive branch as well as the
 
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
um uh representative have wanted to uh
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
have everyone receive sure I'll
 
01:00:29.119 --> 01:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
have everyone receive sure I'll
wait

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.520 --> 01:01:03.430 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right so TR again so the bill
 
01:01:08.109 --> 01:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
before you again I work with the lottery
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
the governor's office as well as members
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
of my own Committee in the Senate um to
 
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
get to a point where there would be
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
something that we could potentially move
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
forward that would get a signature at
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
the end of the day and we'd be able to
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh move forward with a moratorium um as
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
you remember the governor's veto message
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
was the conversation around free market
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
and the fact that there has to be some
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
free market growth um in the industry
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
that was a significant portion of his of
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
his veto message to the legislature um
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it allows for
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
some incremental growth what the
 
01:01:39.069 --> 01:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
amendment does it allows for some
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
incremental growth so if if um a gaming
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
op a gaming gaming operator employer um
 
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039 align:start position:0%
it who put an application in between
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
January 1 and October 15th and the
 
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
October 15th date is because I didn't
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
want to rush to lottery for a gaming
 
01:01:58.589 --> 01:01:58.599 align:start position:0%
operations so I made sure it was a date
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
before this committee was going to act
 
01:02:02.589 --> 01:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
and before the amendment was made public
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
so that there wasn't a rush on lottery
 
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
for uh applications but I think we've
 
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
all recognized that a store course
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
racing has had an impact in the
 
01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on our charitable gaming
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
operations and what this bill will do is
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
allow some incremental growth so anybody
 
01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:18.039 align:start position:0%
who's who invested money and put in for
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
a gaming operators license in the
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
anticipation of the 2024 expiration date
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
was going to happen um it would allow
 
01:02:26.589 --> 01:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
them to be able to continue to move
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
forward if they've filed an application
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
with Lottery between January 1st of this
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
year and October 15th of this year um
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
those people had a reasonable
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
expectation to think that they would be
 
01:02:38.269 --> 01:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
eligible for historic horse racing
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
license June uh July 1 as of this year
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
of of 24 so uh what I've done is I've
 
01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
allowed for some incremental growth you
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
can I think director McIntyre's room you
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
can talk to him how many applicants that
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
are I have no idea I just wanted to
 
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
allow for some incremental growth to
 
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
occur and the second thing this
 
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
amendment does is it extends the
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
moratorium out for four years um as you
 
01:03:02.269 --> 01:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
all know we have a a gaming commission
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's meeting that doesn't have a
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
report due to the end of next year um
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
this will allow time for that commission
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
to do its work to see what the impact of
 
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
histor course racing is on the industry
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
and whether or not um it should be
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
adjusted and then gives time for the
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
legislative process that needs to occur
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
after that report's been filed so the
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
legislature can consume that report and
 
01:03:26.109 --> 01:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
figure out what bills because it's it's
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
due in December it's passed all the
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
filing deadlines so we'd have to wait a
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
whole another nine months before you
 
01:03:34.029 --> 01:03:34.039 align:start position:0%
potentially would see a bill um after
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
the committee report and hence the
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
reason why I pushed the moratorium out
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
four years to give all of that process
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
time allowed to happen um again this is
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
this was done in cooperation with the
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
governor's office my committee and ways
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
and means in the Senate um and the
 
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission I'm proposing it to
 
01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
the house as a reasonable compromise to
 
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
be able to to put some uh constraints on
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
HHR until we have a report but also
 
01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
allow some incremental growth in the
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
industry um in light of the governor's
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
free market argument and I'm happy to
 
01:04:09.269 --> 01:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative ducet thank you
 
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
question you've referenced twice working
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
with the governor's office are you are
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
you telling me that the governor's
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
office wants this piece of legislation
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of confused as to the message
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
there again with the incremental growth
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
as my my understanding that it would
 
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
receive a
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
signature could you repeat that sure
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
with the incremental growth my
 
01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
understanding will get the signature it
 
01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
alleviates the governor's original
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
response to the legislature about the
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
free market allows the free market to
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
continue um without opening the doors
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
Forever Until We have that report from
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
the from the gaming commission follow up
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
follow up so I I remember you testifying
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
in front of this committee about s SP51
 
01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
and how you work with the governor's
 
01:04:59.309 --> 01:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
office and that was going to get a
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
signature how how can we be assured that
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
this is going to get a sign I was a
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
surprised as surprised as you were
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
represented I don't want to be surprised
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
again okay again I can only tell you
 
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
that I worked with the lottery office
 
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
and the governor's office to try to find
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
a compromise to be able to move
 
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
something forward because I I in
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
addition to you agree that a rampant
 
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
expansion of HHR could potentially cause
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
a problem but I'm a guy who works on
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
data we don't have any data we have
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
feelings right now and I don't work a
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
lot on feelings we think it's going to
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
we know we but we don't know the whole
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
point of the commission is to get to we
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
know and so this bill will allow an an
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
expansion of the moratorium until we can
 
01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
get to a we know and when we know we can
 
01:05:40.589 --> 01:05:40.599 align:start position:0%
then act on legislation but until then
 
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
again it's I think I feel I it might and
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
I'd rather have facts and data which is
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
exactly what the commission is supposed
 
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
to do so we extend the moratorium with
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
some incremental growth until we can get
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
that data from um from from the
 
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
commission and then we can act on on
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
proper legislation
 
01:06:02.029 --> 01:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
further represent PL I may be showing my
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
ignorance here but what does historic
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
horse racing got to do with charitable
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
gaming sure thank you so historic horse
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
racing is a loud component of charitable
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
gaming in our charitable Gaming
 
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
facilities um it has a revenue split
 
01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:17.799 align:start position:0%
just like table games do with Charities
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
and everybody else so a certain portion
 
01:06:20.829 --> 01:06:20.839 align:start position:0%
of all the revenue that comes in is
 
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
distributed between the state Charities
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I I basically have two
 
01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:40.839 align:start position:0%
questions I'll merge them um the first
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
is what you you think about the question
 
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
of germanness and the need for having a
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
hearing on this amendment um and uh it's
 
01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
it's consistent with our discuss
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
discussion of a bill we just were
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
talking about it's you know that was um
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
maybe arguable this may be a little less
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
arguable in terms of it's a subject that
 
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
was a part of the large issue of these
 
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
gambling undertakings that uh it was
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
definitely not in 112 the uh
 
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
moratorium um as I recall so my
 
01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is 112 was s in the r
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
shardis Bill did have the moratorium in
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
it this is just a different
 
01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
implementation of that section of that
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
bill okay I didn't I missed that we can
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
go back to that my understanding is that
 
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
was the case no problem uh if it's not
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
the case then it's not a real problem we
 
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
can we can have a hearing um and the
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
second thing is I I strongly support the
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
the uh need for an extension of the mor
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
moratorium and I I thank you for pushing
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
that too and uh and the idea of folding
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
in trying to be fair so that the
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
Enterprises that
 
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
have worked to uh to start a process and
 
01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
invested money would not be cut out by
 
01:08:11.269 --> 01:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
this moratorium I think that's the idea
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
um but um four years seems like a lot of
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
time and uh to me it's more time than
 
01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
it's needed uh I'd be comfortable with
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
two years and maybe you could
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh you could talk about the why why4 and
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
not two because maybe there's a good
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
reason um I'm completely open but but my
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
bias is not to make it too long because
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
this is this is essentially enabling
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
monopolies to develop and to um capture
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
the ground so to speak uh before anybody
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
else can get in thank you thank you for
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
your question so again I obviously
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
accept two years my my thought was along
 
01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
the legislative process process again
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
the committee report from the charitable
 
01:08:58.030 --> 01:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
G from the charitable gaming commission
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
isn't du out until December of 24 um
 
01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
filing dates gone right so that means 25
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
is a dead year you wouldn't be able to
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
pass any legislation in 25 which means
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
the first time you have the opportunity
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
to submit legislation September of 25 to
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
be heard in 26 and by that time the
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
moratorium would end within six months
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
if we didn't take action so so my my
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
plan was the idea was to give it a
 
01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
little longer time for the legislative
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
process to occur given the dates of the
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
commission report our filing periods and
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
all of that um while I wouldn't oppose
 
01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
the two-year again that was a senate
 
01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
position originally when we brought the
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
bill forward and that was passed
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
originally um I just in looking back at
 
01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
the at the legislative process I
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
realized that we have no time to file a
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
bill in 25 um so that was
 
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
all uh if I may uh yes follow up just
 
01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
responding to that uh it seems to me the
 
01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
commission you and I are both on this
 
01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
commission and will'll work hard and uh
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
um we could get the job done in October
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
and if uh Bill needed was needed and I I
 
01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
expect there will be a bill that's
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
needed I think we'll all want to uh have
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
it processed worked on in the following
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
calendar year which means uh getting it
 
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
in within the deadline whatever the
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
deadline is I don't know in the second
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
year what the deadline usually is for uh
 
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
uh filing bills uh it's a little later
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
than it is this year so right again so
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
we' be in the first year of a new
 
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
election cycle right the November of 24
 
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
is going to have the election cycle mean
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
all you'd have a window in November for
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
filing bills but then it's gone when
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
you're elected right you have a window
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
of time and the committee reports not do
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
out till December 1st which is past
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
filing deadlines and so that potentially
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
you could do a late Bill filing but then
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's up to the subject of somebody
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
else so um that was my concern was
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
strictly Bill filing periods running
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
through the election cycle and when
 
01:10:58.030 --> 01:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to file bills so again if
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
you want to modify down to two year
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
three years right to give that whole
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
session uh whole term next term U the
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
the 24 and 25 um or 26 and 27 term I'd
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
be fine with that as
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
well representative shamberg you had a
 
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh along the same
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
lines that representative Ames brought
 
01:11:24.669 --> 01:11:24.679 align:start position:0%
up that if moratorium is mentioned in
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
here there's no need for a public
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
hearing per se but wasn't Senate Bill
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
112 doesn't wasn't it dealing with
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
breakage and those items and that's
 
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
would be non- gerain with this
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
particular bill here again I think it
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
had lots of components to it there were
 
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
lots of stuff that was in there
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
including breakage which was part of it
 
01:11:51.149 --> 01:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
um so again my understanding if I
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
remember right 112 did include a
 
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
moratorium provision if it did then it
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
leaves moratorium as a as a I may be
 
01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
wrong I I'm pretty sure I'm right and
 
01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
that's why 112 was suggested as the
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle um to be able to move this
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
forward representative
 
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you just first I don't see the
 
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
moratorium in the bill but um I haven't
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
read every word right now um but on I
 
01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
what is really moving towards a
 
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
monopolized situation right now is that
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
um The Lottery Commission despite
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
something that was in the original bill
 
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
that said that once a owner has a
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
license it cannot be transferred has
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
found a way that it is
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
transferred um my um not yet built
 
01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
casino is part of a four group group
 
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
casino that was on that was uh put
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
together by uh diagnosed in Manchester
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
he has now sold it to somebody
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
else uh and who is in the the business
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
nationally and and this seems to be
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
going on a fair amount that these
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
licenses are being transferred in a way
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
that I don't not
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
being in that area of law I don't really
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
understand but on this seems to me to be
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
a more immediate concern
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
than new people get as part of getting
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
business what what specifically again I
 
01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
don't I don't necessarily disagree with
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
your representative Aly at all um
 
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
however I had a conversation
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative AMS and I think the
 
01:13:51.629 --> 01:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
problem is that that's that if I did I
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
originally had language to put in here
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
about ownership and 50% ownership and
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
transfer of licensers and that kind of
 
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
thing however it would be non- gerain at
 
01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
that point because now we're talking
 
01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
about the overall issue of a gaming
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
license where this is talking
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
specifically about historic horse racing
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
so I think would have been non- gerain
 
01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
so um I think there you you'll be
 
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
hearing about that in the upcoming
 
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
session if I if I'm not
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
mistaken representative ducet did you
 
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
question yeah my recollection of uh s
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
sp12 it does have to break its language
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
and I I have a proposed amendment that
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
I'm reading through that I submitted to
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
OLS that doesn't address it I believe
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
Lottery and and we can ask them had an
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
issue with a specific uh component
 
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
relative to the
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
language uh breakage in relation to
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
HHR and that that needed some kind of
 
01:14:49.709 --> 01:14:49.719 align:start position:0%
housekeeping cleanup there so I don't
 
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
know if attorney formella can answer
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
that but I believe that's the connection
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
it should be in my Amendment and it's
 
01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:01.470 align:start position:0%
it should be in my Amendment and it's
not

01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
also okay
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.709 --> 01:15:11.719 align:start position:0%
attorney my
 
01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
apologies uh legal counsel for the
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
lottery I'm sorry okay is legal council
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.229 --> 01:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
me um the question is we're trying to
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
figure out if this is in sb12 it's it's
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding there was some
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
confusion with the breakage language in
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
relation to HHR can you clear that up
 
01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
for us because I I thought I had
 
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
submitted in my proposal to OSS for my
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment it doesn't seem to be in
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Langs either and there was
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
something he wanted cleaned up there and
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's with the link with these
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
amendments come
 
01:15:59.709 --> 01:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
from okay I'll I'll dig it up thank you
 
01:15:59.719 --> 01:16:01.350 align:start position:0%
from okay I'll I'll dig it up thank you
Mr

01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
chair any other
 
01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
lley um like representative PL I'm
 
01:16:14.669 --> 01:16:14.679 align:start position:0%
afraid that my question may reveal my
 
01:16:14.679 --> 01:16:17.910 align:start position:0%
afraid that my question may reveal my
ignorance

01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
um but it's kind of along the same lines
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
um so there's been a lot of articles in
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
the newspaper lately about charitable
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
gaming and how it works and how much
 
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
money is being generated and I had this
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
number in my head about 24% right we
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming generated more 24%
 
01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
more gross I think just gross um over
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
the last year so this is really a big
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
big big number that we're talking about
 
01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
and I was talking to a constituent and
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
she was like and and this may be mixing
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
two things together and that's part of
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
why I'm asking the question so you can
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
separate them out because I'm sure
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
constituents are right are watching at
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
home we're talking about breakage and
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
it's all getting very um detailed right
 
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
um but she said I don't understand we
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
have the Lottery Commission it's
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to be funding our schools you
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
know more and more people are gambling
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
every year what where is all the money
 
01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to be you know funding
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
our schools and I'm looking at this
 
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
newspaper article um that talks about
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
the 24% increase in charitable gaming
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
and it says
 
01:17:31.709 --> 01:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
um donations to charitable gaming uh to
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations are made on a
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know rotating cycle it's trying to
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
explain throughout the period 35% of the
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
gross revenues from games of chance will
 
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
be donated to charitable organizations
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
and then in the next line it says in
 
01:17:49.149 --> 01:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
historical horse racing when players use
 
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
the machines to place bets The Gaming
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
facilities keep 12% % of the money it
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
makes after giving out prizes while it
 
01:17:59.229 --> 01:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
may appear that casinos are D donating
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
more to Charities only 3% of gross
 
01:18:05.629 --> 01:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
revenues is split between Charities and
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Lottery Commission so
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
it it does seem to go to representative
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
pl's question of like what does historic
 
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
horse racing have to do with charitable
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
gaming and if I understand the article
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
correctly it's it's very different how
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
much money is going to whereare
 
01:18:28.629 --> 01:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
according to this article 3% is split
 
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
between the Charities and the
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
fund can you walk me through and help me
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
answer my my constituent's question I
 
01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:41.560 align:start position:0%
can and I think director McIntyre behind
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
me will also do a good job at answering
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
this question but so understand that
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
games of chance table games blackjack
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
poker those kind of things there's a
 
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
thing called ggr which is gross Gaming
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
revenue gross Gaming revenue is the
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
amount of money left over after we've
 
01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
paid all the players their winnings
 
01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
right and that's basically your profit
 
01:18:58.750 --> 01:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
right for lack of a better phrase that's
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
your profit your profit Line in games of
 
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
chance that split up um with the charity
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh getting 35% in table games so Poker
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
Black Jack when you play that charity
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
gets a larger percentage in historic
 
01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
Horse Rising The Operators take 12% off
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
the top of of the handle the total
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
amount raised that 12% is then split up
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
between the state the charity
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
and the gaming operator with the state
 
01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
and charity taking 25% and the gaming
 
01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.870 --> 01:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
75% but Charlie will correct me if I'm
 
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
wrong but I'm pretty sure I'm right on
 
01:19:42.189 --> 01:19:42.199 align:start position:0%
that yes you shakeing his head yes yeah
 
01:19:42.199 --> 01:19:43.510 align:start position:0%
that yes you shakeing his head yes yeah
I'm

01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
right so to answer your question
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
historic racing gets a lesser percentage
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
than than table games um and so um and
 
01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:54.440 align:start position:0%
but but we've already exceeded our
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue projections for HHR than more
 
01:19:58.110 --> 01:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
than we ever thought we were going to
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
get so Charities will be seeing money
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
from that which is a new Revenue stream
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better phrase for the
 
01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
Charities because we didn't have HHR
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
before but the question is and the
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
question the committee is going to
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
struggle with the gaming commission is
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
is the increased Revenue that's being
 
01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
done on HHR is that having an impact on
 
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
table games where the Charities get a
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
significant higher portion and we don't
 
01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that yet that's the
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
whole point of the commission is to dig
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
into that and understand are we
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
cannibalizing and giving Charities less
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
money because we' we've implemented the
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
new gaming structure I don't know the
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
answer to that that's the reason why we
 
01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
have the commission is I don't know
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're can HHR is
 
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
cannibalizing table games which is going
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
to result in less revenues for Charities
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
we won't know that until we get some
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
data and we don't have that yet can I
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
have a followup followup so
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
the HHR is not there's no rent for
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
example the you're just getting that 3%
 
01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
is just getting
 
01:20:58.030 --> 01:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
divided I don't know where you're
 
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
getting a 3% from again it's 12% well so
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
yeah 75% uh 25% which is split between
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
the state and the charity would be 3% of
 
01:21:09.149 --> 01:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
12% so yes I get understand why you got
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
the 3% number now um so yes that the
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe there's rent again
 
01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
there I think again Charlie might be
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
able to answer that question but I don't
 
01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
believe there's rent on HHR there is
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
rent on table games so GES a chance
 
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
35% that goes to the Charities um some
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
of that is taken up in rent correct so
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
they pay part of that money back to the
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
casino owner in rent correct so it could
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
be 20% it could be 15% it could be 5%
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
that the charity walks away with so it's
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
a fixed number um again we we talked
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
about this in the gaming commission it
 
01:21:52.669 --> 01:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
is a if you remember the bill we pass
 
01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
passed that established the CH gaming
 
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
commission there were five charges of
 
01:21:58.750 --> 01:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
the commission and one of them was to
 
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
talk about rent to specifically look at
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
the rent issue is is pulling back money
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
from Charities after you've done after
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
you've done the money and whether or not
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
that that's a reasonable practice or not
 
01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
okay um so that is an explicit charge
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
within the charitable gaming commission
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
helpful yes thank you Mr chair and
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so if it's
 
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
only 12% and they're splitting
 
01:22:26.189 --> 01:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
7525 why don't we change the numbers so
 
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
if it is pirating from the other games a
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
chance that the Charities won't be
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
taking a big loss can this be done well
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
again that is one of the charges of this
 
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
commission is to look at the the split
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
if you will what that looks like and how
 
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
that works so again we don't have data
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
yet right but we we have there's only
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
seven locations that have been active in
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
historic Horse Rising and even of some
 
01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
of those they've been active less than a
 
01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
year right so we still have to collect
 
01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
dat data to try to see what that looks
 
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
like so there may be a split change
 
01:22:57.390 --> 01:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
there may not be we don't know CU we
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the data yet the whole
 
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
point of this is not to let the thing
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
explode before we've got the data and
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
can see what the impact was and so hence
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
the reason for a request for a
 
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
moratorium okay follow up so do we have
 
01:23:13.709 --> 01:23:13.719 align:start position:0%
uh even a small amount of data that we
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
could possibly collect like six months
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
or whatever and get an idea maybe what's
 
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
happening or well again that's the goal
 
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
of the commission right we'll have a a
 
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
full year worth of data or that we
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
should be able to look at um but again
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're working a little bit in the blind
 
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
because the annual reports you know when
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
they're done and what what it looks like
 
01:23:32.430 --> 01:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
again director McIntyre could probably
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
answer a lot of these questions but we
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
have some data but we don't have a full
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
impact because we're still in the ramp
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
phase right we're still ramping up so
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
the numbers you know it's hard to pick
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
look at the numbers when you have a
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
October number that's low and a November
 
01:23:47.709 --> 01:23:47.719 align:start position:0%
number that's high because two more
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
places went online right and what the
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
and we don't know what the charity split
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
will look like long term and so again
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
and the whole point of the commission
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
and giving an extended commission to the
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
end of next year was be able to collect
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman uh I'm going
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
to join my colleagues representative and
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
representative leapley in uh feeling as
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
though I'm putting my ignorance on
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
display this this seems to be the day
 
01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
for it um I am sometimes although
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes I feel as though I'm getting a
 
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
better handle on the charitable gaming
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
piece of the gaming stuff um most times
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
I feel like the more I hear the less I
 
01:24:37.149 --> 01:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
understand I would like to
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
request uh a not not today to do not to
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
do this today but to give get a
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
presentation about how all of this works
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
include how decisions get made about
 
01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:57.719 align:start position:0%
which Charities are selected I don't
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
understand that there is any consistent
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
process uh how much the Charities have
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh it would help me to get an idea of
 
01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
what we are actually looking at and I I
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
have have to reiterate I am more
 
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
confused today than I was yesterday
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I there was a
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
presentation done to the gaming
 
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
commission this week and I can get that
 
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
presentation it has the breakdown of
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
financials and a basic basic
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of all gaming in New
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whether it's Lottery lucky s
 
01:25:39.870 --> 01:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
Bingo it has a breakdown of that and the
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
commission the director is also going to
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
get us a primer a basic primer on
 
01:25:44.910 --> 01:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
language and what what it means when
 
01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
you're talking about CH what is a handle
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
mean what does ggr mean what do these
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
phrases mean um and I'm sure we can
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
share that with the Ways and Means
 
01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.030 align:start position:0%
share that with the Ways and Means
Committee

01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
yeah that sounds like a good idea
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chairman I would
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
also really like to understand how
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
Charities are chosen um I
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
don't what I the last I understood and
 
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
again I don't know if this is accurate
 
01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
or not is that each uh Casino gets
 
01:26:18.030 --> 01:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
requests from uh charities in the area
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
and they choose which Charities they are
 
01:26:23.109 --> 01:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
going to give their funds to
 
01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
um if this money is in
 
01:26:31.709 --> 01:26:31.719 align:start position:0%
effect money that is taken away is
 
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
segregated from money that could
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
potentially be going to education and to
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
the business
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
owners I think it makes sense for us to
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
take a look at whether that's the best
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
way to do that and to try to make sure
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
that there aren't say favored Charities
 
01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
of a particular particular casino owner
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
and that charity consistently gets funds
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
and others
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
don't so again Mr CHL remind you that is
 
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
exactly that is a significant issue and
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's why it's one of the five charges
 
01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
again rent being one of them how
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
Charities are selected as a second
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
charge in that commission that we're
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
looking at how that happens and whether
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
that should be regulated um so you're
 
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
not alone in your concerns about how
 
01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
Charities are picked and I will tell you
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
that is part of the commission's
 
01:27:21.229 --> 01:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to look at that and
 
01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
um any other questions I think at this
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
at this time um we are going to need we
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
already talked about the possible need
 
01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
of a public hearing I know
 
01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative ducet has a um amendment
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
that uh may need a public hearing as
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
well so what I would say is hold
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
questions regarding this because during
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have a public
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
hearing and I would also ask Lottery
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
once we know what that date is to to
 
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
come in and answer some of these
 
01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
additional questions so we can uh move
 
01:27:58.990 --> 01:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
on at this time before we move on will
 
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
Lottery be speaking today on this
 
01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.510 align:start position:0%
Lottery be speaking today on this
particular

01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:28:05.229 --> 01:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh if not I do have some
 
01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
questions for lottery if they would
 
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind coming up just real
 
01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:13.430 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind coming up just real
quick

01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
quick
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
quick I was going to suggest this is not
 
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
an amendment that's been submitted by
 
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
any of the members of this committee I
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
have one that will be and I spe laud
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
will speak to it and it's suspiciously
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
similar in text with some changes so I
 
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
think it would cover what you getting
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
that there representative Mr Mr chair my
 
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
particular

01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
particular questions about who is
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
involved how many and where these people
 
01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
that have put applications in are
 
01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
located I thought maybe the director
 
01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:52.870 align:start position:0%
located I thought maybe the director
could

01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
answer that I don't know if that would
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
well that sounds like it it may uh also
 
01:28:59.550 --> 01:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
be similar to representative El Berger's
 
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
question about who are the Charities how
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
are they chosen it's not the Charities
 
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's the applicants that want

signed in the law applications are
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%

01:30:46.629 --> 01:30:46.639 align:start position:0%
relatively the same and I'll wait for
 
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment to go around as the piece
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%

and and if I might add Mr chair while
 
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
people are getting the amendment the
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
members are getting the amendment we're
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
talking about a singular game here HHR
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
these charitable gaming houses have in
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
numerous games Blackjack roulette poker
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
21 we could go on and on with different
 
01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
choices we talking about a very specific
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
game an electronic game that this
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
legislature went back and forth over
 
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
about six years okay and I I was a
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
proponent a great proponent and still
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
remain a great proponent for this
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
because what it did in fact was these
 
01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
charitable Gaming facilities that host
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
the ability to have HHR in their
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
facilities serve two Charities a day
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
instead of one at the end of the day
 
01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
that's what this is about it's about
 
01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:55.750 align:start position:0%
that's what this is about it's about
charitable

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
01:31:59.830 --> 01:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
gaming so to me at least the argument
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
about free market and I'm a free market
 
01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
guy this does not negate anybody's
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
ability to apply with lottery for a
 
01:32:12.270 --> 01:32:12.280 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming license and be
 
01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:15.400 align:start position:0%
approved and open a facility with local
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
approval and open a charitable gaming
 
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
license and I guess I'd ask uh director
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
McIntyre back because I do have a direct
 
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
question in in relation to
 
01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
this what what we did as a legislature
 
01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
in in bringing forward HHR was to offer
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
that added component and obviously the
 
01:32:40.109 --> 01:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
component right
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
now and I would venture to say that we
 
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
have just scratched the surface as to
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
the impact of this one particular game
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
in these gaming halls and I guess my
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
question for the director is prior to
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
the approval and the uh signing at the
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
law of HHR how many charal gaming
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
license had you received let's just say
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
in the prior five
 
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
years um good morning and thank you for
 
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm sorry the
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
question I'm have Chief compliance
 
01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
officer answer so representative you
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
said this would be an estimate by would
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
say over the past five years we probably
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
have received in the neighborhood of
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
eight to 10 applications prior to the
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
HHR prior to HHR okay and subsequent to
 
01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
the and that's over how many five years
 
01:33:37.109 --> 01:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
over five years okay so roughly eight I
 
01:33:39.149 --> 01:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
would say eight to 10 again there would
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
be an estimate there's probably some
 
01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
leeway in there okay and since January 1
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
with the Advent and the ability for
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
people to apply for HHR licenses coupled
 
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:54.280 align:start position:0%
with charitable gaming is is there a way
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
to break that out or let me let me step
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
back here how many charitable game
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
gaming license applications have you
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
received at Lottery since January 1
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
since January 1 for games of chance uh
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
as director maryre said we currently
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
have four okay four four cents in the
 
01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
last few months less than a year in the
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
last year or so yes okay okay and and if
 
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
I could ask another question how many of
 
01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:26.830 align:start position:0%
I could ask another question how many of
The

01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
The
 
01:34:29.709 --> 01:34:29.719 align:start position:0%
Operators that held charitable gaming
 
01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
licenses prior to HHR have changed
 
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
hands if I if I could the technically
 
01:34:39.149 --> 01:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
there was no changing of hands the
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
corporation which was licensed
 
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
previously is still the licensed
 
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
Corporation the shares of that
 
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
Corporation were sold so essentially the
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
same LC e exists it's just um the shares
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
are held by different owners okay so no
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
none have changed hands correct and that
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
was an opinion by the Attorney General's
 
01:34:59.709 --> 01:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
office notk thank you for that so what
 
01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
I'm getting at with this amendment this
 
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
this covers uh a lot of uh house clean
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
keeping issues uh unruly patrons and
 
01:35:11.229 --> 01:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
such but to the Crux of this again we're
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
at the moratorium and and I I restate
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about one component one
 
01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.550 align:start position:0%
we're talking about one component one
game

01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
game
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
HHR terrible gaming I'm I'm also a
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
member of the uh gaming commission but
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
I'm also a member of this legislature
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
and and a commission does not negate us
 
01:35:31.629 --> 01:35:31.639 align:start position:0%
legislating what we need to legislate to
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
deliver for our
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
constituency it's not the the first time
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
you've heard me say and I I will take I
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
have broad shoulders I I was a very big
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
proponent for HHR but but even I
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have expected to see what we've
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
seen in the growth of these particular
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
games I live in the town of Salem
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
anybody lives on a Border Town Nashua
 
01:36:01.709 --> 01:36:01.719 align:start position:0%
seab Brook Salem and the like can
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
understand the interest for some outside
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh interests to come in and and start
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
charal gaming Halls because that's the
 
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
model we have here in New Hampshire and
 
01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
by the way in within the borders of New
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think we have
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
14 terrible Gaming facilities if I'm
 
01:36:22.990 --> 01:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
correct uh operating that is correct
 
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
okay at present we have 14 four in the
 
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
queue with applications with Lottery
 
01:36:32.830 --> 01:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
that that's the possibility of some 18
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
Which is far in excess of anything in
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
the totality of New England so to say
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
that a moratorium on a singular
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
game is negative to the free market I I
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
I don't agree with that argument quite
 
01:36:52.109 --> 01:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
frankly and and if we look at it this
 
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
way I I sat on the gaming commission on
 
01:36:57.870 --> 01:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and I heard uh the dean of the
 
01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:01.159 align:start position:0%
Senate Senator L alesandro speak about
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
how much of the airwaves and especially
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
the news media coverage of Simply
 
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
DraftKings is taking on and I don't know
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
in case you not notice but there are
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
many vendors for sports gaming but for
 
01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:19.719 align:start position:0%
some reason we have one vendor in the
 
01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's a monopoly okay this isn't about
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
monopolies this isn't about negating the
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
ability of anybody to take on the
 
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
ability to open a chable gaming Hall and
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
to help those
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
communities that uh would welcome charal
 
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
gaming and and reap the benefits from
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
the revenue for the Charities so in this
 
01:37:49.149 --> 01:37:49.159 align:start position:0%
I offer up the ability and I had this
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
drafted well before and if you look on
 
01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:54.990 align:start position:0%
drafted well before and if you look on
line

01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:37:59.589 --> 01:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
19 I put a drop dead date of September
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
1 and with uh conversations with Lottery
 
01:38:07.229 --> 01:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
it's come to my attention that a more
 
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate date would be October 18th
 
01:38:11.310 --> 01:38:11.320 align:start position:0%
which was yesterday so it would cover
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
the four applicants at present that are
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
in the queue but it would be my position
 
01:38:20.830 --> 01:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
and I understand the position of of uh
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
of others on on this Committee
 
01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
in that uh two years or four years maybe
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
I think you know the days of kicking the
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
can down the road on issues we need to
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
address upfront and and full boore are
 
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
are here so I'm I'm a little animated
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
about this because I I bear some of the
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility of getting this passed
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't want the state of New
 
01:38:45.589 --> 01:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to turn into the state of New
 
01:38:47.709 --> 01:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
Jersey and I don't want Salem New
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to become Atlantic
 
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
City okay also if you note in the last
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh section of my Amendment it eliminates
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
the rent component hard stop no rent it
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
should have been gone a long time ago
 
01:39:07.229 --> 01:39:07.239 align:start position:0%
so uh I I know that we should and we
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
will in discussions with the clerk uh
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to have a work
 
01:39:12.669 --> 01:39:12.679 align:start position:0%
session on this and we can talk at this
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
at length but I I think my position is
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
very clear to see on this um
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
and um I look forward to having those
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
discussions so thank
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh representative elberger
 
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chairman I I want to
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
make clear I want to clarify what I
 
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
think I heard because if I got it right
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
it makes no sense to me in nashwa we
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
currently have two small casinos that
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
were owned by a nashille resident
 
01:39:54.189 --> 01:39:54.199 align:start position:0%
who as I understood it sold the license
 
01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
to an outof State group that is going to
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
be closing those two casinos and moving
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
them into the old Sears building in the
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
Pheasant Lane Mall which is not just a
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
border City I mean the parking lot is in
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the the building is in
 
01:40:10.639 --> 01:40:13.390 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the the building is in
New

01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think what you said was that
 
01:40:19.229 --> 01:40:19.239 align:start position:0%
that license wasn't really sold I'm I'm
 
01:40:20.669 --> 01:40:20.679 align:start position:0%
trying to get my head around this one
 
01:40:20.679 --> 01:40:22.950 align:start position:0%
trying to get my head around this one
too

01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
I I can only suggest to you that gaming
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
can I move this yes please thank
 
01:40:31.149 --> 01:40:31.159 align:start position:0%
you uh I can only suggest you that
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
gaming operators are amongst the most
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
single most talented people at finding
 
01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
loopholes I would point you to Missouri
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
where there are only Riverbats and the
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
law allows you to be overwater so as
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
long as you're over water at some point
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's the riverbat even though you go
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
down 12 levels and there's a puddle in
 
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
the basement um the license was not sold
 
01:40:56.589 --> 01:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
the shares of the company were sold and
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
with that went the assets of the company
 
01:41:01.390 --> 01:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
and that included the ability to apply
 
01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
for and receive a license for HHR this
 
01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679 align:start position:0%
was what as was explained to us the
 
01:41:07.229 --> 01:41:07.239 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office so pined on
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
this and approved it it was not our
 
01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
idea thank you my my hair which is
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
already thin feels like it's getting
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.550 align:start position:0%
 
farther

01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
farther
 
01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:24.270 align:start position:0%
farther
representative

01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
Boger thank you Mr chairman
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
um in looking at the U the uh Amendment
 
01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
2336 uh down on line 28 it's talking
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
about and it seems like the uh com the
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
committee here was their intent was to
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
have a non-transferable license and it
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
sounds like one of the loopholes is the
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
sell of uh uh a majority shares in these
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
company which then allows another one
 
01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
and my question does if a a hedge fund
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
or a larger Corporation buys it as a
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
subsidiary company would they still
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
remain as a licensee while a larger
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
Corporation would control the
 
01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:21.790 align:start position:0%
Corporation would control the
subsidiary

01:42:21.790 --> 01:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
subsidiary
 
01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:23.229 align:start position:0%
subsidiary
thank

01:42:23.229 --> 01:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
yes followup followup so would it be
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
advisable under those 28 if the intent
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee is to restrain the
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
transfer of these licenses to maybe add
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
a little more in depth verbiage to that
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
to to control it or do do these
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
loopholes or do you want to continue
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
with the loopholes that's up to the
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
you do you have an opinion on that
 
01:43:02.189 --> 01:43:02.199 align:start position:0%
thought I'm sorry I just confirming my
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
colleague go I I can address that so as
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
director McIntyre said it was our
 
01:43:09.629 --> 01:43:09.639 align:start position:0%
initial assessment that the licenses
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
were not transferable at all um and
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately the Attorney General's office
 
01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
opined that um the transfer of interests
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
in the entity would um would be
 
01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
permissible under the statute as written
 
01:43:25.589 --> 01:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
there is language in the horse racing
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
statute um which talks about the um
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
transfer of 50% or more which is more
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
specific and my understanding from the
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office is that if
 
01:43:38.229 --> 01:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
that language had been imported into the
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
historic hor racing bill that it would
 
01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
have uh placed more restrictions on the
 
01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh on that loophole uh that director
 
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
maryre had
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
identified follow up thank you Mr
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
chairman now that would cover the stock
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
purchase portion of it but what happens
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
if they're bought as a subsidiary of a
 
01:44:01.629 --> 01:44:01.639 align:start position:0%
larger Corporation has that been
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
addressed that has not been addressed
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
specifically um I would have to take a
 
01:44:08.910 --> 01:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
look at the specific language or the
 
01:44:10.589 --> 01:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
specific transaction I do want to make
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
one clarification to we still review
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
suitability on any ownership transfers
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
um even if it's within if if it's the
 
01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
permissible transfer that you're talking
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
about we would still review the the uh
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh individuals or corporations that are
 
01:44:29.950 --> 01:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
purchasing that um but with respect to
 
01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
your specific question um I would have
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
to get uh get an opinion from the
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office on
 
01:44:39.310 --> 01:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you uh what is
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
the do we have any ability to uh go back
 
01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:55.639 align:start position:0%
fix the language and require that no uh
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
owner or including of the shares on is
 
01:45:07.229 --> 01:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
Casino it would it would be difficult to
 
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
opine on the legality of it I would
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
think on a going forward basis um
 
01:45:17.149 --> 01:45:17.159 align:start position:0%
certainly that would be permissible uh
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
as retro retroactively I think that
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to do
 
01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
and and also I certainly when I was in
 
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts one of our sister agencies
 
01:45:28.510 --> 01:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
where I worked was The Liquor Commission
 
01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
and there was a law that said only you
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
could only own three liquor stores and
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
those with large families owned
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
more so I would suggest that
 
01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
they as we are on track to on have an
 
01:45:47.709 --> 01:45:47.719 align:start position:0%
completely uncontrollable by anybody in
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
this state on single or double
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
owners of all of the the casino gambling
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
in this state but I I did want to
 
01:46:03.629 --> 01:46:03.639 align:start position:0%
suggest if we're going to have a public
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
to suspend conversation on at this point
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
and move to the next as soon well as
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
soon as you finish that's exactly what I
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
was going to say because we're going Mr
 
01:46:19.589 --> 01:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
chairman if I could obviously you were a
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
member of the commission as well the
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
study commission and if I could I would
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
happily provide the same presentation we
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
gave this week to the members of the
 
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
commission as well as updated numbers in
 
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
terms of Revenue and the like and also
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
the same information we're going to
 
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
provide to the commission as Senator
 
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
Lang said we would provide as well in
 
01:46:38.229 --> 01:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
advance so that they would have areas to
 
01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
question us on specifically versus right
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
that that would that's a good idea I
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
think um getting an advance is good so
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
that people can review it and hopefully
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
move through it and ask uh questions
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
more appropriately representative
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
leapley I have a quick question I hope
 
01:46:57.390 --> 01:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
um and it's about the amendment that we
 
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
just received um it says no charitable
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
organization shall receive less than 35%
 
01:47:06.430 --> 01:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
of the gross revenues from any games of
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
chance uh minus any prizes paid so any
 
01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
games of chance including HHR no
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
no uh representative thank you for the
 
01:47:17.790 --> 01:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
question uh games of chance has a
 
01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
specific meaning within the law and that
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't include store for racing okay
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
and does this amendment um make any
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
statement about Revenue generation for
 
01:47:30.639 --> 01:47:34.030 align:start position:0%
statement about Revenue generation for
the

01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
state yeah I don't think it makes any
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
changes no okay thank
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you very
 
01:47:44.189 --> 01:47:44.199 align:start position:0%
much all right I'm going to close the
 
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
sp12 we'll now open open the work
 
01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
sp190 any comments on uh sp190 um yes
 
01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:12.030 align:start position:0%
sp190 any comments on uh sp190 um yes
Senator

01:48:12.030 --> 01:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
Lang thank you members of the committee
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
so um this bill basically creates a tax
 
01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
for online what's called Advanced
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
deposit wagering
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
another one you'll get in your primer
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
possibly um but it basically is that in
 
01:48:27.870 --> 01:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
horse racing um you used to call it you
 
01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
could call in to a racetrack and place
 
01:48:32.430 --> 01:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
your bet people don't call in anymore
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
they use an application on their phone
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
and this modernize it this is a request
 
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
from Lottery and from um the AG's office
 
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
to modernize statute to bring it in so
 
01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
that those apps are considered within
 
01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
the terms of ADW Advanced deposit
 
01:48:49.109 --> 01:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
wagering the one ask I would have is if
 
01:48:50.830 --> 01:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
you pass this is to amend didn't and dro
 
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
the taxx rate um we currently have a tax
 
01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
rate for in place so people like the
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
brook um currently pay um this this tax
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
um and so rather than create two
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
separate tax rates um so on this side of
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
the aisle or the Republican side of the
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
AIS argue that you're not creating a new
 
01:49:11.070 --> 01:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
tax you're just conforming a tax with
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
with the industry and on the left side
 
01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
of the aisle you're just going to create
 
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
new Revenue um that'll be available for
 
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh education uh spending um which where
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
the revenue goes from the state so I'd
 
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
ask you to drop the tax to 1.25 which
 
01:49:25.229 --> 01:49:25.239 align:start position:0%
creates a consistent tax rate whether
 
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
you're an inperson or an online gaming
 
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
it representative Aly thank you I don't
 
01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
see the tax rate in here I I don't have
 
01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
a copy of the bill so not
 
01:49:43.390 --> 01:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
sure line 12 I think they just said page
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
two line 12 oh thank you one so it's
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
1.25 so uh yeah change it move it down
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
to 1.25 which would be consistent with
 
01:49:56.189 --> 01:49:56.199 align:start position:0%
existing law for inperson gaming
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
operators Charlie is that right yeah
 
01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:01.390 align:start position:0%
operators Charlie is that right yeah
that's

01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:03.719 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I'm a little confused as to
 
01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
what um charitable game uh games of
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
chance would
 
01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:13.990 align:start position:0%
chance would
be

01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
subject so this isn't games of chance
 
01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:18.679 align:start position:0%
this is strictly simoc cast horse racing
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
strictly simcast
 
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
it's a well I should say sim cast I
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
think it also covers bround so it also
 
01:50:27.629 --> 01:50:27.639 align:start position:0%
covers the two locations we have that
 
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
are licens so as you know greyhound
 
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
racing we've outlawed New Hampshire we
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't do and we restricted the licenses
 
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
and grandfathered in and there's only
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
two facilities left that can do no two
 
01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
there's Brooke and Belmont are the two
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
facilities that can do simoc cast racing
 
01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
because they've had it right now
 
01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
currently only the brook does it um and
 
01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
so this would again apply to that simoc
 
01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:53.719 align:start position:0%
cast horse racing Churchill you know
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
watching uh the Kentucky Derby and be
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
able to bet on the Kentucky Derby
 
01:50:59.550 --> 01:50:59.560 align:start position:0%
because it's outside of the provisions
 
01:51:04.830 --> 01:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:07.069 --> 01:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
gaming representative
 
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
duet thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question um would you be
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
surprised if I told you there are
 
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
Outlets that have been taking these
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
types of bets for over two decades at at
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
this time not be taking them at this
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
very moment but have been taking these
 
01:51:25.229 --> 01:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
bets I understand there have been
 
01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
organizations that have been doing that
 
01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
and the point of this law is to bring
 
01:51:30.189 --> 01:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
bring give the Attorney General
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
something to enforce because the again
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
the issue from the attorney general my
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
understanding was it's a gray area
 
01:51:38.910 --> 01:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
they're not sure whether it's loud or
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
not allow and this just clarifies the
 
01:51:42.510 --> 01:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
law and makes it easier represent my La
 
01:51:44.589 --> 01:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
you're killing me you're your your light
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
is on on the other
 
01:51:48.750 --> 01:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
side so you're killing not I just want
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
you to kill your battery that's all
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
um so again this was a clarification
 
01:51:54.109 --> 01:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
request this was a housekeeping bill
 
01:51:56.030 --> 01:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
that it it's it was happening in New
 
01:51:57.550 --> 01:51:57.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there was a question whether
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
whether it was legal not legal could
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
they pursue them not pursue them and so
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
the point of this this bill was to
 
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
clarify that law and to say yes in fact
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
it is legal and yes you are in fact
 
01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
subject to the tax and to make it
 
01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:11.430 align:start position:0%
subject to the tax and to make it
absolutely

01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
clear follow up with all respect I I
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
disagree with this being a housekeeping
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
issue what I believe
 
01:52:24.109 --> 01:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
and if we if we wanted to as an entity
 
01:52:26.669 --> 01:52:26.679 align:start position:0%
take bets on horse racing that does that
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
mean I can take a bet on horse racing no
 
01:52:32.510 --> 01:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
we we have Statute in place and what I
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
can tell you is I've met with the
 
01:52:35.550 --> 01:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
attorney general I've brought my
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
concerns forward I believe some of these
 
01:52:39.550 --> 01:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
entities that have been taking these
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
bets who have been um bonusing these
 
01:52:46.270 --> 01:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
bets so they so people would bet with a
 
01:52:48.669 --> 01:52:48.679 align:start position:0%
platform rather than going to at the
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
time Rockingham Park seabook Park and in
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
my best estimation and it's and it's
 
01:52:59.069 --> 01:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
kind of kid from Lawrence math in excess
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
of tens and tens of millions of dollars
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
in Revenue that this state is
 
01:53:07.149 --> 01:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
owed and it's my opinion that the
 
01:53:10.069 --> 01:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
Attorney General needs to do a dig into
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
this that we don't sweep this under the
 
01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
rug as a
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
committee and that we we send this
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
packing when we exec this bill because I
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
believe there's some some issues that
 
01:53:23.709 --> 01:53:23.719 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed at the doj and need
 
01:53:26.229 --> 01:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
to be addressed directly specific to
 
01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
this particular piece of legislation so
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chair respond so again
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
pursuant to our constitution we can't
 
01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
make a retrospective law so we can't go
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
back in time and you know as that old
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
saying when's the best time to plant a
 
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
tree it was 10 years ago we chose not to
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
do that we didn't imp we didn't do do
 
01:53:44.910 --> 01:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
that so now we draw a line in the sand
 
01:53:47.310 --> 01:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
and say this is the issue whether or not
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
someone was not complying with the law
 
01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
10 years ago was completely up to the
 
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
attorney general irrespective of this
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
law being passed so if someone vied the
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
law a year ago they could still go after
 
01:53:58.870 --> 01:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
them for violating a law a year ago that
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean this bill is invalid um so
 
01:54:04.069 --> 01:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
I guess I just say that again my my
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
point is I didn't plant the tree 10
 
01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
years ago so I'm planting the tree now
 
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
just to do that housekeeping
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
clarification and make it absolutely
 
01:54:14.350 --> 01:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:22.310 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
all right I am going to um if there's no
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
other questions I'm going to end the
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
sp190 okay
 
01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
now what I'd like to do is um have a
 
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
caucus uh next is is the exec exing
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
these bills uh we already know that
 
01:54:49.149 --> 01:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
we cannot exec uh sp12 because we have
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
um an amendment that we would uh have
 
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing on and we'll do that at
 
01:54:57.709 --> 01:54:57.719 align:start position:0%
our next meeting so uh the other three
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
bills um we possibly can exec so I want
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
to have a uh Republican caucus and I
 
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
think uh Susan Aly would like a u
 
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
Democratic caucus so it's uh
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
11:25 um let's try to be back here at um
 
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
we need
 
01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
15 um we probably need 20
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh let's be back here at quarter of
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
sharp because we don't want to um we if
 
01:55:28.030 --> 01:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
we can get this all done and uh not go
 
01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
to lunch and come back I'm sure you all
 
01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
would like that so let's be uh prompt
 
01:55:34.629 --> 01:55:34.639 align:start position:0%
and be back here at quarter of 12 so
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%

underlying Bill uh regarding the 80%
 
02:26:16.590 --> 02:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
limit being restored to 100% where it
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
was was prior to
 
02:26:22.990 --> 02:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
2018 but it also addresses the dr's uh
 
02:26:25.550 --> 02:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
concern uh that we do not limit it

a
 
02:31:22.110 --> 02:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
key fund inside of the department in
 
02:31:26.469 --> 02:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
agriculture which is meant to deal with
 
02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
um Agricultural Product testing and

um Agricultural Product testing and
registration

02:31:32.309 --> 02:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
registration
 
02:31:35.269 --> 02:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
testing uh and field
 
02:31:38.990 --> 02:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
inspection issues um a lot of this is
 
02:31:41.389 --> 02:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
not going on at this point because of
 
02:31:48.750 --> 02:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:52.590 --> 02:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
on the dedicated fund that is now called
 
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
the Agricultural Product and scale
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
testing fund
 
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
on has not done scale testing for quite
 
02:32:04.950 --> 02:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
a long time and it also is not doing a
 
02:32:09.309 --> 02:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
lot of the work that needs to be done to
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
to uh test and guarantee the contents of
 
02:32:19.389 --> 02:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
pet food and cans the contents of animal
 
02:32:23.070 --> 02:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
feed the contents of fertilizers and
 
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
liming and other soil
 
02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
amendments on which is a major part of
 
02:32:34.030 --> 02:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
the work of a normal Department of
 
02:32:38.830 --> 02:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
Agriculture um it also has a
 
02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh a large reserve of
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
1.25 million at this point you take
 
02:32:50.230 --> 02:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
away um the money that was spent out of
 
02:32:52.510 --> 02:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
it last year for
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
animal um datab
 
02:32:59.030 --> 02:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
base but that money would
 
02:33:02.830 --> 02:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
disappear fairly quickly if they were
 
02:33:06.950 --> 02:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
not added to it on the
 
02:33:14.550 --> 02:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
two small funds in here the um in
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
on 430
 
02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:19.670 align:start position:0%
on 430
4

02:33:19.670 --> 02:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
4
 
02:33:22.340 --> 02:33:22.350 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:33:22.350 --> 02:33:24.150 align:start position:0%
and and
[Music]

02:33:24.150 --> 02:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
four uh
 
02:33:31.630 --> 02:33:31.640 align:start position:0%
431 uh 6 I believe it is I've got to
 
02:33:36.190 --> 02:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
check on those um they add up to
 
02:33:38.550 --> 02:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
considerably less than a million dollars
 
02:33:43.790 --> 02:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
but adding them to um this new newly
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
named fund agricultural products Reg
 
02:33:50.150 --> 02:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory fund on will
 
02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
allow um the fund to
 
02:33:59.510 --> 02:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
continue uh to match expenditures with
 
02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
um with
 
02:34:05.910 --> 02:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
revenues and they were part of the
 
02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
original um bill which was to create a
 
02:34:11.309 --> 02:34:11.319 align:start position:0%
totally new
 
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
fund uh to do what was supposed to be
 
02:34:17.070 --> 02:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
done in this fund and
 
02:34:21.630 --> 02:34:21.640 align:start position:0%
the the other thing that this does is to
 
02:34:24.150 --> 02:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
write into law for the first time the
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
actual purpose of this
 
02:34:30.790 --> 02:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
Fund in addition to renaming it to
 
02:34:32.910 --> 02:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
reflect that
 
02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
purpose so it
 
02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
um it simplifies things and it
 
02:34:42.670 --> 02:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
challenges the Department of Agriculture
 
02:34:45.550 --> 02:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
to start um building up the databases
 
02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
they need to free up their staff to
 
02:34:53.389 --> 02:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
work in the fields and in the um uh
 
02:34:55.349 --> 02:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturing industry food
 
02:35:00.110 --> 02:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturing Industries to um do the
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
inspection and supervision and testing
 
02:35:06.870 --> 02:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
that they should be doing so that's
 
02:35:09.150 --> 02:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:11.670 align:start position:0%
thank you any
other

02:35:11.670 --> 02:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:35:15.309 --> 02:35:15.319 align:start position:0%
comments all right seeing none can can I
 
02:35:18.510 --> 02:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
just clarify yes so representative Aly
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
am I understanding it correctly we're
 
02:35:23.269 --> 02:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
not creating a new fund we're relabeling
 
02:35:23.279 --> 02:35:24.469 align:start position:0%
not creating a new fund we're relabeling
and

02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:27.230 --> 02:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
explaining an existing fund exactly but
 
02:35:29.510 --> 02:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're also broadening it by directing
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
three additional sources of revenue that
 
02:35:34.030 --> 02:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
previously have gone to the general fund
 
02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
will now be added to that pot it's two
 
02:35:43.710 --> 02:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:49.469 --> 02:35:49.479 align:start position:0%
um and I've got to oh here it is on
 
02:35:51.469 --> 02:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
section two and section
 
02:35:57.429 --> 02:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:02.510 --> 02:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
43142 um to move that money in and both
 
02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
of these are for are concerning uh
 
02:36:11.429 --> 02:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
fertilizer and soil amendments um and
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
4316 to read as follows that they're
 
02:36:24.910 --> 02:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
going to deposit that into there uh at
 
02:36:27.630 --> 02:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
this point those are both going to the
 
02:36:31.309 --> 02:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
general fund but they are
 
02:36:34.790 --> 02:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
collected from uh
 
02:36:37.110 --> 02:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
companies on I believe it's all
 
02:36:41.710 --> 02:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
companies that are actually um doing
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
creating fertilizer and creating uh soil
 
02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:48.190 align:start position:0%
creating fertilizer and creating uh soil
amendments

02:36:48.190 --> 02:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:50.269 --> 02:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
okay and the fees is under four as well
 
02:36:54.830 --> 02:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
right and and there the the I need to to
 
02:36:56.750 --> 02:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
look it up again but in the dedicated
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
fund book they they've been
 
02:37:01.910 --> 02:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
bring uh well they aren't in the
 
02:37:05.349 --> 02:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund book but it was
 
02:37:10.750 --> 02:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
in in one of our I think here it's in
 
02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
the original fiscal note um they bring
 
02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
in a total each year of$
 
02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:21.910 align:start position:0%
in a total each year of$
385,000

02:37:21.910 --> 02:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:25.230 --> 02:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
so they are not much of a loss to the
 
02:37:28.349 --> 02:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
general fund and they are the tonnage
 
02:37:33.630 --> 02:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
registration program for soil and plant
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh uh I I'll look them up and the
 
02:37:38.429 --> 02:37:38.439 align:start position:0%
fertilizer registration program and the
 
02:37:41.150 --> 02:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
lyming registration program there are
 
02:37:44.230 --> 02:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
three of them two of them must be in the
 
02:37:49.550 --> 02:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:56.190 --> 02:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
clear all right uh representative ORS so
 
02:37:57.950 --> 02:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
just so I understand the two new funds
 
02:38:00.510 --> 02:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
are one's for the database money's going
 
02:38:04.349 --> 02:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
to the database no the database was uh
 
02:38:07.750 --> 02:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
settled last year uh the commissioner
 
02:38:10.750 --> 02:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
got a bill through to take
 
02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
250,000 out of this fund that we are
 
02:38:16.469 --> 02:38:16.479 align:start position:0%
renaming uh
 
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
to be used in creating the uh
 
02:38:25.630 --> 02:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
dog uh
 
02:38:28.950 --> 02:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
registration uh database once they've
 
02:38:32.389 --> 02:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
got that database up it's a template for
 
02:38:36.389 --> 02:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
the rest of the department to start um
 
02:38:41.790 --> 02:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
to create databases for parzer and lming
 
02:38:44.550 --> 02:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
to create a database over in pest
 
02:38:49.230 --> 02:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
control and and I personally expect that
 
02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
they will
 
02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:52.990 align:start position:0%

um

02:38:52.990 --> 02:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:59.469 --> 02:38:59.479 align:start position:0%
use parts of that million 25 that's left
 
02:39:04.389 --> 02:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh in end of year balance each year to
 
02:39:07.790 --> 02:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
create those databases so that they can
 
02:39:09.469 --> 02:39:09.479 align:start position:0%

representative Aly turn your microphone
 
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
on could you check with the clerk about
 
02:41:32.750 --> 02:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
whether 3 385,000
 
02:41:35.469 --> 02:41:35.479 align:start position:0%
is enough that it needs to be on the
 
02:41:35.479 --> 02:41:38.389 align:start position:0%
is enough that it needs to be on the
regular

02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
calendar all right
 
02:41:44.030 --> 02:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:47.150 --> 02:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
allow would it is it required to be on
 
02:41:50.309 --> 02:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
the regular calendar so you're asking is
 
02:41:52.630 --> 02:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
there a threshold by which if we go over
 
02:41:57.070 --> 02:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
then yeah 285,000 yeah well we know know
 
02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
the other one has we have an undefinable
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
actually fiscal note on the other one we
 
02:42:07.349 --> 02:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
don't know how much it could cost but on
 
02:42:10.190 --> 02:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
this one isn't the cost where it's from
 
02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
the general fund it's from the general
 
02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:13.790 align:start position:0%
the general fund it's from the general
fund

02:42:13.790 --> 02:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:42:17.750 --> 02:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes okay so I just maybe I should have
 
02:42:20.030 --> 02:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
tried to check with the clerk beforehand
 
02:42:24.030 --> 02:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure and representative Aly
 
02:42:25.950 --> 02:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
will write the committee
 
02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
report you'll you'll write the committee
 
02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:36.510 --> 02:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
right okay we'll close the exec session
 
02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:47.230 --> 02:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
494 as far as sb112
 
02:42:49.710 --> 02:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
goes uh we established earlier during
 
02:42:51.950 --> 02:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
our work session that we need to do
 
02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
public hearing so we will not exec sp12
 
02:42:59.469 --> 02:42:59.479 align:start position:0%
at this time um at our next meeting
 
02:43:01.389 --> 02:43:01.399 align:start position:0%
which uh we're planning on being our
 
02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
last for this year we'll have a public
 
02:43:06.510 --> 02:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
hearing and then we'll
 
02:43:10.309 --> 02:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:12.790 --> 02:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
sp12 any question yes representative
 
02:43:18.269 --> 02:43:18.279 align:start position:0%
Ames just uh I I expect to um do an
 
02:43:22.230 --> 02:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
amendment to 112 also okay that will uh
 
02:43:24.510 --> 02:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
be narrow and specifically focused on
 
02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:25.630 align:start position:0%
be narrow and specifically focused on
the

02:43:25.630 --> 02:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:43:27.830 --> 02:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
moratorium issue and the license
 
02:43:29.790 --> 02:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
transfer issue that we
 
02:43:34.429 --> 02:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
discussed um and uh I guess it's
 
02:43:36.269 --> 02:43:36.279 align:start position:0%
important to know what our what the
 
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
deadline is because you need to have
 
02:43:40.990 --> 02:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
that Amendment uh when we go to that um
 
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
when when are you can I ask when we
 
02:43:46.590 --> 02:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
might be meeting um it it's looking like
 
02:43:49.070 --> 02:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to meet um three
 
02:43:52.950 --> 02:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
weeks from now on November 9th okay yeah
 
02:43:55.870 --> 02:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
that would be fine from I'm sure yeah
 
02:43:57.150 --> 02:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
and that would be our that would be our
 
02:43:59.469 --> 02:43:59.479 align:start position:0%
last meeting so we'll need to finish uh
 
02:43:59.479 --> 02:44:03.550 align:start position:0%
last meeting so we'll need to finish uh
all

02:44:03.550 --> 02:44:03.560 align:start position:0%

02:44:37.190 --> 02:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:44:40.150 --> 02:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
second all right would you like to speak
 
02:44:41.790 --> 02:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
to your
 
02:44:47.150 --> 02:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
motion I think I've spoken to it
 
02:44:49.469 --> 02:44:49.479 align:start position:0%
okay any representative
 
02:44:55.070 --> 02:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you um I understand that uh
 
02:44:58.429 --> 02:44:58.439 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang is planning on putting in
 
02:45:01.630 --> 02:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
another bill about this in
 
02:45:05.469 --> 02:45:05.479 align:start position:0%
January so we would have a second
 
02:45:08.910 --> 02:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
chance to discuss
 
02:45:12.670 --> 02:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
this so we would have a second chance to
 
02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:14.070 align:start position:0%
this so we would have a second chance to
discuss

02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:24.510 align:start position:0%
discuss
this

02:45:24.510 --> 02:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:27.870 --> 02:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
right well then I would suggest um we
 
02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
have a number of questions about it
 
02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
because we don't really understand
 
02:45:40.269 --> 02:45:40.279 align:start position:0%
on who is betting
 
02:45:43.349 --> 02:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
where uh I I was under the impression
 
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
that it it
 
02:45:50.309 --> 02:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
this is includes any New Hampshire
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
person who is establishing a bit with
 
02:45:56.830 --> 02:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
any of the three companies that had been
 
02:45:58.910 --> 02:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
doing this and now two of them are still
 
02:46:01.469 --> 02:46:01.479 align:start position:0%
doing it but they don't it doesn't have
 
02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:15.790 align:start position:0%
 
brook

02:46:15.790 --> 02:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
brook
 
02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:16.550 align:start position:0%
brook
all

02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:46:19.990 --> 02:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
right so I think that that helps us a
 
02:46:25.870 --> 02:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
little but we um we really wanted to see
 
02:46:29.389 --> 02:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
interim study or something similar on
 
02:46:29.399 --> 02:46:30.190 align:start position:0%
interim study or something similar on
this

02:46:30.190 --> 02:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:46:32.910 --> 02:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
bill I don't know if anyone else wants
 
02:46:35.230 --> 02:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
to speak who else
 
02:46:38.309 --> 02:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
um you want to speak to it FR yeah just
 
02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
just to be clear I think that there's
 
02:46:43.269 --> 02:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
some substantial issues with this
 
02:46:45.550 --> 02:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
legislation uh going forward and we need
 
02:46:47.870 --> 02:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
to dig deeper than studying it I think
 
02:46:51.429 --> 02:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
we need to set send this out itl and we
 
02:46:52.830 --> 02:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
can come back and look at another piece
 
02:46:56.110 --> 02:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
of legislation again the Kick the Can
 
02:46:58.630 --> 02:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
down the road approach we need to stop
 
02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
doing that this this needs to be
 
02:47:03.590 --> 02:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
addressed it's a true issue it's my
 
02:47:05.750 --> 02:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
belief that the state has
 
02:47:09.190 --> 02:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
owed large revenues by some of these
 
02:47:10.710 --> 02:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
folks that have been taking these types
 
02:47:14.550 --> 02:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
of bets and the AG of the State of New
 
02:47:17.110 --> 02:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs to address this directly
 
02:47:19.590 --> 02:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
and I think the best course of action is
 
02:47:23.429 --> 02:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:25.950 --> 02:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
legislation yes representative Aly thank
 
02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
you this is the first time I've heard in
 
02:47:32.349 --> 02:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
this room specified by anybody well that
 
02:47:35.910 --> 02:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
I've heard it all on what issue might be
 
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
involved so you're talking about the
 
02:47:42.630 --> 02:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
past bets that people were doing under
 
02:47:44.910 --> 02:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
the federal law and that are still going
 
02:47:47.710 --> 02:47:47.720 align:start position:0%
going on under the federal law by two
 
02:47:50.950 --> 02:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
companies that we should be able to
 
02:47:52.630 --> 02:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
recoup money
 
02:47:55.110 --> 02:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
from is that what you're saying
 
02:47:56.670 --> 02:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not an attorney but
 
02:47:59.950 --> 02:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is this I know for
 
02:48:02.910 --> 02:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
decades a certain entity was taking bets
 
02:48:04.990 --> 02:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
on simal cast racing and they were not
 
02:48:06.469 --> 02:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:48:09.309 --> 02:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
to take bets on simulcast racing hard
 
02:48:13.070 --> 02:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
stop we lost Revenue in in the
 
02:48:15.309 --> 02:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of what whatever 1
 
02:48:15.319 --> 02:48:16.190 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of what whatever 1
uh

02:48:16.190 --> 02:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:48:19.230 --> 02:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
25% of those millions and tens of
 
02:48:22.429 --> 02:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars were and I believe
 
02:48:26.070 --> 02:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
it's the the process that the AG should
 
02:48:30.630 --> 02:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
pursue that um I've met with the AG uh
 
02:48:32.830 --> 02:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to be his decision at at the
 
02:48:35.550 --> 02:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
end of the day but I plan on being a
 
02:48:39.790 --> 02:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
loud proponent to pursue this we are
 
02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
owed substantial Revenue as a state
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're here to talk about Revenue in my
 
02:48:50.230 --> 02:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:53.870 --> 02:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
piece representative ORS thank you Mr
 
02:48:56.950 --> 02:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
chairman uh my my thoughts are similar
 
02:49:00.750 --> 02:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
to uh representative Duets just in that
 
02:49:05.070 --> 02:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
if we are owed a large chunk of Revenue
 
02:49:06.790 --> 02:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
due to slight of hand where somebody
 
02:49:08.269 --> 02:49:08.279 align:start position:0%
wasn't playing
 
02:49:10.910 --> 02:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
fair if we cannot keep them out of
 
02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
future business I I would think uh we
 
02:49:16.990 --> 02:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
should see this through and see if there
 
02:49:20.070 --> 02:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
is a chance to collect these revenues if
 
02:49:21.910 --> 02:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
they are as substantial as a
 
02:49:24.070 --> 02:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative do set seems to think
 
02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:25.510 align:start position:0%
representative do set seems to think
they

02:49:25.510 --> 02:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:49:27.750 --> 02:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
are representative
 
02:49:32.590 --> 02:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
Aly yes I'm trying to understand as I as
 
02:49:35.550 --> 02:49:35.560 align:start position:0%
I understand it we have a situation
 
02:49:40.510 --> 02:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
where we've got uh three companies which
 
02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
have been taking bets under the federal
 
02:49:47.229 --> 02:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
law uh without a New Hampshire
 
02:49:52.110 --> 02:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
law and those three companies realized
 
02:49:55.830 --> 02:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
somehow last year that they were
 
02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to be under the New Hampshire
 
02:50:02.830 --> 02:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
law and two of them have just continued
 
02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:03.830 align:start position:0%
law and two of them have just continued
taking

02:50:03.830 --> 02:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
taking
 
02:50:08.190 --> 02:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
bets and the third one Churchill Downs
 
02:50:11.830 --> 02:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
has suspended taking bets until this
 
02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
gets worked
 
02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:16.710 align:start position:0%
gets worked
out

02:50:16.710 --> 02:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:20.550 --> 02:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
and the effect
 
02:50:25.830 --> 02:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
of not passing this now or at least uh
 
02:50:28.710 --> 02:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
having a chance to look at it next year
 
02:50:31.590 --> 02:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
would be that for two more years this
 
02:50:34.070 --> 02:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
situation would continue those two other
 
02:50:36.469 --> 02:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
companies will be taking bets from New
 
02:50:39.750 --> 02:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the one unless the
 
02:50:42.349 --> 02:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is a wizard and gets
 
02:50:44.229 --> 02:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
through things a lot quicker than they
 
02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
usually do uh the other one Churchill
 
02:50:50.110 --> 02:50:50.120 align:start position:0%
Downs would continue to be
 
02:50:53.309 --> 02:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
suspended and it suspended
 
02:50:55.990 --> 02:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
itself representative
 
02:50:59.070 --> 02:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
duet and not not to name specific
 
02:51:02.830 --> 02:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
vendors or what have you but I I would
 
02:51:05.110 --> 02:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh I would offer that it's been a lot
 
02:51:07.910 --> 02:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
longer than the last year that they knew
 
02:51:11.710 --> 02:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
this was going on and one would have to
 
02:51:14.070 --> 02:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
ask themselves why would you stop doing
 
02:51:16.550 --> 02:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
something that you've been doing for
 
02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
decades because a piece of legislation
 
02:51:22.830 --> 02:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
was submitted okay I think it Ling this
 
02:51:25.030 --> 02:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
puts the fire to the feet of the AG's
 
02:51:26.830 --> 02:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
office and the doj's office to get
 
02:51:29.910 --> 02:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
something done for the state so I'm not
 
02:51:32.790 --> 02:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
sending a muted message to the industry
 
02:51:35.750 --> 02:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is this we're
 
02:51:38.910 --> 02:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
owed it's our attorneys General's job to
 
02:51:40.990 --> 02:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
pursue that and it needs to be pursued
 
02:51:42.750 --> 02:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
I've known about it for a number of
 
02:51:44.950 --> 02:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
years and it keeps getting SW swept away
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden this legislation
 
02:51:53.790 --> 02:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
session yes representative
 
02:51:59.269 --> 02:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
Southworth uh thank you um would this
 
02:52:02.670 --> 02:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
also be able to be address through the
 
02:52:06.269 --> 02:52:06.279 align:start position:0%
commission not at all I don't mean um
 
02:52:09.750 --> 02:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
the owing the money I mean clarifying uh
 
02:52:12.269 --> 02:52:12.279 align:start position:0%
some of the items in uh the bill it's
 
02:52:14.670 --> 02:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
not charitable it's not okay just wanted
 
02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure about
 
02:52:20.070 --> 02:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
that representative PL yes I'm no
 
02:52:22.990 --> 02:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
attorney but if we were to pass this
 
02:52:25.150 --> 02:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
legislation then the Attorney General
 
02:52:27.349 --> 02:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
pursued it in court the courts could say
 
02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
well you got law now so it's moved uh
 
02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
and so we could lose that
 
02:52:37.309 --> 02:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
Revenue representative Aly it does seem
 
02:52:41.070 --> 02:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
to me that we've only got uh one of
 
02:52:43.590 --> 02:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
we've only stopped because it stopped
 
02:52:47.309 --> 02:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
itself one of the three
 
02:52:53.190 --> 02:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
on groups that is um benefiting by
 
02:52:56.910 --> 02:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
not on paying attention to the New
 
02:53:01.070 --> 02:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law and is the attorney
 
02:53:03.750 --> 02:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
general going to in response to this
 
02:53:07.870 --> 02:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:12.030 --> 02:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
two represent I may
 
02:53:15.309 --> 02:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
I I can't speak for the attorney General
 
02:53:16.830 --> 02:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
I've met with the attorney general
 
02:53:20.030 --> 02:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
brought this issue the clock is ticking
 
02:53:22.349 --> 02:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
um others have brought this to his
 
02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
attention and I think a clear statement
 
02:53:26.670 --> 02:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
from this committee to the attorney
 
02:53:30.590 --> 02:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:33.590 --> 02:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
