00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
Bingo uh so the first item is from the
 
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.990 align:start position:0%
Bingo uh so the first item is from the
Lottery

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
Lottery
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
Commission the commission did submit a
 
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
conditional approval which
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
addressed most of the comments um but
 
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 align:start position:0%
there were still some remaining as there
 
00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 align:start position:0%
was uh 14 forms with this 62 page rule
 
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
so catching everything was a little
 
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
difficult um but I have been in contact
 
00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
with Valerie King to go over the
 
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
discrepancies between the form and the
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
rule text that were missed um there were
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
a couple editorial fixes and then one
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
editorial unclear on page 10 of the
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request um due to
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
some missing language um in the rule
 
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
text from the form certification and
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
based on our conversations it's my
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
understanding that the commission's
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
going to ask for an oral conditional
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
approval to address those
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
items um and I can go over each one
 
00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919 align:start position:0%
individually or I can go right to the
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
last issue with this particular rule I
 
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
think we can trust the two of you to
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
sort through the form issues as long as
 
00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:17.879 align:start position:0%
there's an agreement okay uh what is are
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
there any other issues the only other
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
remaining issue is there's a note to
 
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
jail car um and a legislative intent
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
comment on the first page of the
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
conditional approval which was carried
 
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
over from the final final proposal um in
 
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
the commission's notice that was filed
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
with the initial proposal indicated that
 
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
these rules are to address statutory
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
amendments but these statutory
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
amendments were made back in
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
2021 um and then additionally there were
 
00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
some further amendments that were made
 
00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:52.149 align:start position:0%
some further amendments that were made
in

00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
2023 so there is a question about why
 
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
there was a delay in implementing the
 
00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
2021 and 202 three amendments and this
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
kind of also ties into to a note to the
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
committee on page 13 of the final
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
proposal where there was a statutory
 
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
amendment in 2016 to the amount that
 
00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
private campgrounds and hotels could
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
charge for special bingo games from $2
 
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
to $5 but it wasn't until this
 
00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
particular proposal that the commission
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
updated that amount so it seems like
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
there's been some delays in updating the
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
rules to reflect statutory
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
changes good
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
morning yes sorry good morning my name
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
is Valerie King I'm the director of the
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
investigations and compliance division
 
00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
over at New Hampshire lottery that is
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
the unit that overseas charitable gaming
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
um delays in implementing the
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
legislative changes can be laid solely
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
on me I am the in addition to my duties
 
00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
as the Director of the division uh I
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
also am the sole rule writer for the
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
agency and in the past few years you may
 
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
be aware that the gaming rules have um
 
00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of changes into our
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
agency with regards to legislation we've
 
00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
had sports betting in
 
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
2019 we had historic horse racing added
 
00:09:17.079 --> 00:09:17.990 align:start position:0%
2019 we had historic horse racing added
in

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
2021 which um we promulgated rules as
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
quickly as we could for those but since
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
2021 we've had 23 new law changes and
 
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
the most recent in 2024 there were eight
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
so we've had a lot going on and so I
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
have been we've although the rules have
 
00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
not changed we do make sure that our
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
lenses are aware of the statutory
 
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
changes we have newsletters we send out
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
email blasts to make sure that they are
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
aware of those changes and we do not com
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
make them comply with rules that do not
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
you know because laws over supersede the
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
the rules so we make sure they're aware
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
of any of those changes
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
um we've also been doing a lot of
 
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
changes internally to change our
 
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
processes this as um uh attorney Ricard
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have a lot of forms we've
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
been revising a lot of those forms and
 
00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
our processes to make it easier for
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
primarily our Charities to apply for
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
example I
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
recently um there was some legislative
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
changes to make sure that the definition
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
of a charitable organization is a stame
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
across all game types this would allow
 
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
us to change our process to give
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
Charities would be um apply to be
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
eligible for all game types and once
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
found eligible they can just um request
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
game dates which so we are trying to
 
00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:44.519 align:start position:0%
make a lot of changes and that has
 
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
slowed down our ability to to keep up
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
with um legislative changes to the and
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
and reflected in the
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
does someone have a motion move to
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
approve second all right move by Senator
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
Li can we just make sure though that
 
00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:10.519 align:start position:0%
when we move to approve that we have
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
their agreement that they're going to as
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
motion that there we have their
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
agreement to work on the forms and to
 
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement yes
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely that that is what you meant
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
correct that's what I okay yes seconded
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
by representative Len I'm wondering if
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
we need to redo the seating of
 
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
alternates for regular members you yes I
 
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
did because Senator Lang is now in and
 
00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
some else can make the motion well
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
you're here you're a member okay okay um
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes the I believe it was representative
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
grassy was sitting for Senator Lang
 
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
um actually it's Senator gray who's
 
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
sitting for uh Senator Lang um Senator
 
00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me representative grassy was
 
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
sitting for representative Schmidt but
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
is now sitting for Senator I see so we
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
have five house members who are here
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
three senators and alternates for repes
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley and Senator Enis correct
 
00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:14.839 align:start position:0%
correct okay and then we
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
have three yes
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Madam chair yes one of the house
 
00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
members is sitting in for Senator I
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
think that maybe we should rise that
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
agreed okay
 
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
Senator gray you should sit in for
 
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
Senator Andis then and who and
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative H Grassi is in for Sen
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
for repres Senator Whitley correct
 
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.790 align:start position:0%
for repres Senator Whitley correct
okay

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
what he was sitting for Senator Lang who
 
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.189 align:start position:0%
what he was sitting for Senator Lang who
has

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
arrived okay
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%

00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:00.519 align:start position:0%
still sitting in for representative
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
Whitley Senator gray is sitting in for
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%

wasn't aware of who all was going to be
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
here all right so Senator Lang has made
 
00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
a motion to approve with the
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%

about the forms um uh upon review of
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
that section and the reporting
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
requirements at en
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
30606 H1 and2 if you look closely at
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
Pages uh 17 and 18 attorney Ricard noted
 
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
that the form e5e which is also in the
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
packet um
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
had some discrepancies with the rules
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
language in H1 we have made the form and
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
Rule consistent such that utilities must
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
file an accident report
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
um the form E5 within five business days
 
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
of notification of an accident and in H2
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
we've made the form consistent with u
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
the detailed follow-up report being made
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
automatically within 15 days of the
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
accident there were similar concerns
 
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
that Ian um 3086 regarding discrepancies
 
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
in reporting timelines with the e5e
 
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
accident reporting form and those have
 
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.149 align:start position:0%
accident reporting form and those have
been

00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
addressed um finally eversource
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
requested language changes at um en
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
30606 J that's page 18 which we have
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
included this was to make it consistent
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
with the provision at308
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
06b primarily that if a death um occurs
 
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
as a result of a reported accident and
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
is known to the utility
 
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
then the utility is required to report
 
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
this fact in an additional
 
00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
report um finally we we would also like
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
to note for the committee that the
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
department has begun rulemaking by
 
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
filing um uh
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh en 20115 rule the department filed
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
for fiscal impact statement and initial
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
Proposal with the LBA relative to this
 
00:20:59.230 --> 00:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
rule on 1016 24
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday our understanding and
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
expectation um is that we'd be at the
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
January Jael car and that the Pu
 
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
procedural rules aim to be at the
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
January 25 Jael car meeting as well
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
um the new Department rule en2 105 will
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully be approved at the same time
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
um as the puc rule whether that's
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
January 25 or in an earlier date um
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
um if if the um Ru making proceeds even
 
00:21:35.789 --> 00:21:35.799 align:start position:0%
more speedily and we happen to be at
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
Janu uh December
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
jar H and this will eliminate the
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
concern about a lapse in the
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
Department's authority to wave rules a
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
comment was made in this rule set where
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
en 20115 is referenced
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
twice um we updated for jelar that we
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
would be in the rulemaking process
 
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
relative to2015 but wanted to report
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
about the more expedited trajectory
 
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
um and so for those reasons um and that
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
explanation we um hope that the um
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
committee will approve our request for
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%

00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%

it thank you so
 
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
much Senator so on your new rule F
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
F2 it says that affects 500 customers or
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
more with an expected duration
 
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.310 align:start position:0%
more with an expected duration
exceeding

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
exceeding
 
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
um no never mind I I think I answer my
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
own question but we read it again you're
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
good thank you sorry well I'm glad to
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
know the careful uh work will will
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
straighten it out I'm a little concerned
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
that while you're very rapidly
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
responding to some customers the other
 
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
customers and affected uh people don't
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
get a chance to look at these new rules
 
00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
and have you considered it how it might
 
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.110 align:start position:0%
and have you considered it how it might
affect

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
affect
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
them well I I think you know we we went
 
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
through the regular rulemaking process
 
00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.789 align:start position:0%
through the regular rulemaking process
and

00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
um doing our best to accommodate uh the
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh utilities uh last minute requests um
 
00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's as far as we've
 
00:24:08.909 --> 00:24:08.919 align:start position:0%
gotten yeah all
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
right representative L um thank you
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
madam chairman and thank you very much I
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
live in a pretty populated area so 500
 
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
customers is um seems reasonable to me I
 
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that in other
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
areas of the state that that is also
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate um because I know referring
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
from my area to others doesn't always
 
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:31.549 align:start position:0%
from my area to others doesn't always
work

00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
m in even in less populated areas 500
 
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
customers is significant yeah I would
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
say 400 I would say 499 is pretty
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
significant I mean th this is one of
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
those situations where
 
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
technically we're seeing 500 but if
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
you've got 400 and and 87 those people
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
are going to be very unhappy uh and even
 
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
if doesn't technically meet the standard
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
so how are we handling that is yes is
 
00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:06.039 align:start position:0%
there any restriction on reporting
 
00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
definition M Jarry you're asking if they
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
can also report it there 400 if they
 
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
want to yeah that's what I want to make
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
sure yeah yeah okay well here you go
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's also is involves aircraft trains
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
commercial boats closure of a state
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
highway considering how how many of them
 
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
we have there's that covers a lot
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
anticipated to be reported publicly I I
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
think that we're covered for the
 
00:25:39.919 --> 00:25:41.630 align:start position:0%
think that we're covered for the
487

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
487
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%

we've had a request for public testimony
 
00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
from a representative from the puc just
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
to clarify the filing of their 200 rules
 
00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
oh please yes we yes good morning I'm

Sarah Fuller I'm a I'm a senior adviser
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
attorney to the Public Utilities
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
Commission and their uh rulemaking
 
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.950 align:start position:0%
Commission and their uh rulemaking
representative

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission is going
 
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
to submit their final proposal um in
 
00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
December so uh we had hoped maybe it
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
would be November it's not going to be
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
November probably because our comment
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
period we've extended comment period uh
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
through October 22nd I understand that
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
we would have to flip our 200 proposal a
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
few days later to get it in November the
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
180 days would put us on the December
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
meeting the agreement that the Public
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission has worked out um
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
with the Department of energy is that if
 
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
their proposal which we have worked
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
diligently with them and supported them
 
00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:09.559 align:start position:0%
to PR to prepare and submit to fiscal
 
00:27:12.269 --> 00:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
impact on their waiver if that is not
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
ready to be approved until January what
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
we would do is we would submit for
 
00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:19.799 align:start position:0%
hopeful approval in December with an
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
adoption date in January which will
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
allow them to continue to use pu
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
20.05 as their w
 
00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
uh going forward because of RSA 12 p14
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
which allows them to rely and use pu
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
rules unless they are amended so I just
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
because of the timing issues I just
 
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to put on the record very clearly
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
that it isn't the intent of the Public
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission to have our
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
procedural um rules proposed in final
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
format and be here in December to
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
discuss those with you and and if the
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
department of energy uh needs another
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
month to um go through the process to
 
00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
get their waiver rule that's of course
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
something that we would work with them
 
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
as sister agencies to make sure that
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
they're not left without rules um but
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
how we would do that is we would just uh
 
00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:17.519 align:start position:0%
delay our effective date on our adopted
 
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
rule so I just wanted to clarify um for
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
the committee and thank you for your
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
time all right any
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
for clarifying find that we
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh wondering what's been happening to
 
00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.630 align:start position:0%
uh wondering what's been happening to
those

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
Dr so this is uh proposal 2024 138 on
 
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax and um this
 
00:28:48.669 --> 00:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
actually should have been on consent I
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
had two comments that you can still see
 
00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:54.519 align:start position:0%
in your packet for the final proposal um
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
turns out it's just my ignorance in the
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
in the field that caused these comments
 
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh my first is on
 
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
32 um I was concerned because it was
 
00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:09.519 align:start position:0%
allowing operators to um ask for cash
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
for the taxes upon paying with a credit
 
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
card um but this is not a requirement
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
it's a option and it allows them to
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
um deal with the the the fees that come
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
from from doing a credit card action and
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
my other comment was about um filing for
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
a extension on a tax return and I did
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
not know that if you file an extension
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
you have to pay the tax before you do
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
the I I've never been laid on my taxes
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
so I didn't know that was a thing so
 
00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:48.039 align:start position:0%
those comments are no longer relevant
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
and so I have no other comments okay are
 
00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:54.919 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
concerns motion to approve all right has
 
00:29:59.789 --> 00:29:59.799 align:start position:0%
been moved by representative hackin
 
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:02.519 align:start position:0%
Phillips second by Senator Lang
 
00:30:02.519 --> 00:30:03.909 align:start position:0%
Phillips second by Senator Lang
questions

00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
comments those in favor I
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
much and other other
 
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
repeal um actually that's an emergency
 
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
rule emergency rule oh I'm sorry
 
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
emergency HHS we have emergency rule yes
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
I'll discuss it briefly and then let the
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh Department fill in the details
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
um this is an a rule to require
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
Interstate criminal record checks for uh
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
licens exempt child care providers
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
currently people in the home and the
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
providers themselves have to have
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
criminal record checks this would
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
require it uh for Interstate under
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
it's required uh by federal law and it
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
is in the new um state plan which just
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh was implemented at the beginning of
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
this month
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
um is there a possibility that the
 
00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:16.039 align:start position:0%
department could have realized that they
 
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
would need rules for this earlier ye yes
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
but uh the program did not realize that
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
and now they need the rules in place or
 
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
they'll be in violation of the state
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
plan and uh the Federal Regulations
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
which would uh subject the department to
 
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
a 5% penalty which could be more than
 
00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.590 align:start position:0%
a 5% penalty which could be more than
$900,000

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
good morning Nicole Valena rules
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the Department of Health
 
00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
and Human
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
Services and I'm Brian Clark general
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
counsel for the Bureau of Child
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
Development and Head Start
 
00:31:57.389 --> 00:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
collaboration so yes uh the Bureau of
 
00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
child devel vment has been working um on
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
coming into compliance with the new
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
federal rule um we had been working on
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire um connection
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
information system which is the computer
 
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
system which will be a One-Stop place to
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
have background checks done and it'll be
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
able to cover in state and out of state
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
and so the new requirement is to use
 
00:32:24.629 --> 00:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
that system because it's the only way we
 
00:32:26.909 --> 00:32:26.919 align:start position:0%
can do out of state background checks
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
and otherwise we we just wouldn't be
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
able to comply with the rule um and it's
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
rather unfortunate that we did not
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
realize that we were missing this
 
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
component we were focused on the New
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh connections information
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
system we weren't focused on the rule
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
and that was an oversight and we didn't
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
realize until September 18th um at which
 
00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:52.519 align:start position:0%
point we took Swift action to do an
 
00:32:52.519 --> 00:32:55.669 align:start position:0%
point we took Swift action to do an
emergency

00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
okay so if I understand this correctly
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
this is to do criminal background checks
 
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
on licensed
 
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.830 align:start position:0%
on licensed
exempt

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
correct wondering what the benefit of
 
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
being licensed exempt is if they still
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
have to go through all the background
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
checks and so forth other than the fee
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
of course state law currently requires
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
the background checks uh this will be
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
expanded to out of state as
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
well so if an individual has lived in a
 
00:33:38.629 --> 00:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
state other than New Hampshire within
 
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
the previous five years this is now the
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
capacity to to check that criminal
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
background record check oh thank you
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
very much yeah sure of course okay
 
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
representative Lon uh thank you madam
 
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
chair um as I was looking through it
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
seemed like there were a lot of changes
 
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
within this um emergency rule are all of
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
those changes necessary in order order
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
to meet that Federal deadline or was
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
anything else added in alongside it yeah
 
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
aside from editorial like gender pronoun
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
things like that everything else is
 
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
correcting the website it was an expired
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
outdated website a lot of text you saw
 
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:14.599 align:start position:0%
extracted was the very detailed former
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
process that was paper uh and didn't
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
allow for Interstate background record
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
checks so yes it does look like a lot of
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
text but it is connected to this right
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
now thank
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
you anyone else
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I don't we don't we
 
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
don't have to do anything to the
 
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
emergency rule so that's
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
that all right thank you is there
 
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
anything else from
 
00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
anyone director moral uh three quick
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
things first I'd like to thank the uh
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
