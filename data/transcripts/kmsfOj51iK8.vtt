all thank you Brian and um I'm going to
 
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
let my State Rep um representative
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
ryford I've appointed her as chair of
 
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
the committee I appointed her as clerk
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
so go ahead representative hi I'm
 
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative I'm representative Sher
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
reinford and I also represent Goffstown
 
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
this is my first term I am a guppy in an
 
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 align:start position:0%

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
great at it I know um so with that the
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
start time for these committees is
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
almost always going to be 10:00 a.m. I
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
don't see any reason we start before the
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
chairs meet at 9:00 so um we would
 
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
always start at 10: plan on Tuesdays for
 
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
our meetings um I don't see any reason
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
we would meet another day but if needed
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
I'd give you a lot of notice for that um
 
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
there's an email that you can email the
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
entire committee it is the house housing
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
committee at ledge. state. n. us um so
 
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
keep in mind please do not when you
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
email a committee make sure that you're
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
not making it a public meeting so don't
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
discuss um content maybe discuss meeting
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
times um you can just you can pass
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
around an amendment and say that you
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
plan on offering an amendment but um
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
this emailing the committee does not
 
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
constitute a public meeting unless you
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
make it one so if you email the
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
committee an amendment that's that's
 
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine but do not discuss
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
content over email make sure that the
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee um is all present and the
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
public has an opportunity to participate
 
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
um dress and decorum I expect committee
 
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
members dress professionally especially
 
00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:36.759 align:start position:0%
during public hearings um we need to set
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
comes to testifying and uh cell phon
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
role here in the uh Workforce housing
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
space in New Hampshire the Department of
 
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs has been
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
around since
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
2017 we are the state's primary Economic
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
Development and promotion and
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
recruitment uh Department uh we have um
 
00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
a number of different divisions that
 
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:36.519 align:start position:0%
include all of the state's activity to
 
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
recruit and retain businesses and
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
Workforce uh we work uh very directly
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
with all of our International Partners
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
to drive markets for our employers we
 
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
have staff that work on a on the ground
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
with businesses around the state um and
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
we also do uh all of the Workforce
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
Development funded programs Federal
 
00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:03.079 align:start position:0%
funded programs um and then all of the
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
state tourism uh development and
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
marketing which um is the fun part of
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
the job right um back in
 
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
2022 uh when we saw the uh the state and
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
local fiscal recovery funds become
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
available under arpa then Governor snu
 
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
made a pretty significant decision which
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
was to invest $100 million of that
 
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
funding into the issue of affordable
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
housing in New Hampshire obviously we at
 
00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
that time and continuing uh to this day
 
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
uh place a an extremely high um priority
 
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
on the on the crisis that we currently
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
have with housing in New Hampshire um it
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
is obviously a local and a municipal
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
issue but on a Statewide issue there is
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
no employer that I talk to around the
 
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that says we have
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
enough places for our employees to live
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh given the fact that a big part
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
of what our state our state our
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
department does in terms of recruitment
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
um and we don't just recruit tourists we
 
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
recruit Workforce and we recruit
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
businesses uh a big part of that is the
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
ability to be able to find places for
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
those people and those businesses that
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
we recruit to have a place to live so uh
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
that is kind of why we are in this mix
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh personally uh earlier in my career I
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
did work for uh the Department of
 
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
Housing and Urban Development so uh I
 
00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
have at least that background uh and uh
 
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
have done some private development over
 
00:12:55.189 --> 00:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
the course of my career and uh I can
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
bring a little bit of understanding of
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
those markets to this initiative
 
00:13:02.829 --> 00:13:02.839 align:start position:0%
so uh the $100 million was set up in a
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
program we called the invest NH program
 
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
that launched in the summer of
 
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
2022 uh we very quickly staffed up and
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
brought those funds to the market by
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
November of that year we had made
 
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
initial Awards of $60 million to uh
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
for-profit and nonprofit developers of
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
multifam housing in the state that had
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
an affordability component to it to
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
advance those projects quickly and
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
efficiently uh to Market uh we really
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
felt that we needed to get as many units
 
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
facilitated and available for residents
 
00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
as quickly as we could that component of
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
the program is pretty much wrapped up at
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
this point we have um all told with all
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
the various components under invest and
 
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
AG uh had a financial relationship with
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
over 5,000 units uh new unit that have
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
come online uh we do a lot of this in
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
partnership with our colleagues at New
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority uh
 
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
they have been doing this a lot longer
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
than we have and they have a number of
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
other really significant Federal
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
resources that are part of the uh
 
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
solution here but I guess one of the
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
things I wanted to make sure that I
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
emphasized is that um as we have been
 
00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
through this process and I mentioned 60
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
million of the 100 million the remaining
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
40 million of that has gone to local
 
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the form of in three
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
forms first uh we had what we called our
 
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
Municipal perun program so for
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities that
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
permitted uh affordable housing uh in
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
their Community within a 60-day period
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
they became eligible for Grants of
 
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
$10,000 per unit uh to be able to use
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
however they felt was uh was important
 
00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
so some communities put those in rainy
 
00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
day funds some communities put those
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
funds right back into that project other
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
other communities used it for
 
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:14.759 align:start position:0%
infrastructure upgrades or whatever the
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
case might be but that was a very
 
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
popular program and and we have run the
 
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
course on that program another one uh
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
that worked we where we worked with
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities was in a demolition
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
program and for a lot of communities
 
00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:32.759 align:start position:0%
this was actually kind of a big deal we
 
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
were able to put some resources toward
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
making more land available for housing
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
of any type uh in a community uh the
 
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
applicants were uh the municipalities
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
themselves um sometimes this ended up
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
being um just straight reduction of
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
density other times it was for uh Pro
 
00:15:58.509 --> 00:15:58.519 align:start position:0%
projects like an Old Mill um an Old Mill
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
programming in uh in Franklin uh as I
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
recall where there were a couple of out
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
buildings that were no longer necessary
 
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
and we were able to make that cost a
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
little bit more uh available for uh the
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
community and for the the construction
 
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
of those units the last
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
program and we did this in Partnership
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
again with our colleagues at New
 
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing was What's called the
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
housing opportunities program and uh
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
this particular program I think speaks a
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
lot to where we are headed uh this was a
 
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:35.959 align:start position:0%
program that allowed communities the
 
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity with some funding to
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
consider if we were going to do housing
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
of some type and at some level what does
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
that look like in our community um this
 
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
is not as I'm sure you are all aware a
 
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
state where this where in my view uh the
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
state government is going to say these
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
are the thresholds that every Community
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
must meet uh in to address this this
 
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
issue I do not I do not see that
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
happening and I do not personally think
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
that would be a good approach but where
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
we are able to have communities and I
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
call these communities the communities
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
of the willing to say that this is uh
 
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
important to us for one reason or
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
another but we're not maybe really
 
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799 align:start position:0%
looking for a 500 unit multifam
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
development but we might be looking at
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
15 maybe 20 units uh in an area that
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
makes sense an area where there is
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
transportation in place where there is
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in place uh and then to
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
have the resources to consider how they
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
might actually pursue that project
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
either through planning or zoning or
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
whatever the case might be so you know
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
as we have gotten to the point where uh
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
these programs have kind of run their
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
course that particular program I think
 
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
we got to almost 70 communities in New
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with those funds and I think
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to say that there are 70
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
communities who effectively raised their
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
hand and affirmed that this is something
 
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
that they're willing to take some time
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
and consider really plays toward what I
 
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
think the long-term solution of this
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
problem begins to look like which is you
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
know we can have a trillion dollars in
 
00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:21.799 align:start position:0%
federal money but if we don't have any
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
communities that are willing to sit talk
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
about this and to consider how they
 
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
might want to participate in the
 
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
solution to this then we we that that's
 
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
a useless amount of money right so uh
 
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
there are great examples across the
 
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
state of how this type of investment has
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
improved the uh the economies in those
 
00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
communities without necessarily
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
addressing the issues of community
 
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
character and the other things that we
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
find so critical in New Hampshire and I
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
guess you know sort of the last thing I
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
would say is on that point we which is
 
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
when I spend most of my day and my staff
 
00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
spends most of their day talking with
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire and out of
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that are looking to come
 
00:19:12.149 --> 00:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
here or are looking to expand into this
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
state one of the things and probably the
 
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
top of among the top two or three things
 
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
that we often hear about is how unique
 
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is and how unique our
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
individual communities are right we are
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
not a state that again has these sort of
 
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
Statewide zoning rules in place that
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
start over time making every Community
 
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
look the same now every community in New
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire feels very different and I
 
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
think all of you can certainly
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and it is something that
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
makes the state appealing to the very
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
people that we are trying to see either
 
00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:54.919 align:start position:0%
come here and start a business or or
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
expand their business in New Hampshire
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
and so it connects to the housing piece
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
and it connects to the community
 
00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
character piece and I think taking an
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
approach as we've taken with the invest
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
in ag program has um I think given a
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
little bit of an indication as to some
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
of the types of solutions that might be
 
00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
available there the last thing I'll
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
mention Mr chairman is uh we are now um
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
launching uh a new program called the
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
housing Champions program that was uh um
 
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
was passed by the legislature a few
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
years ago just like three weeks ago we
 
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
announced the first 18 communities that
 
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
have been named housing Champions uh
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
this is uh not terribly complex process
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh where a community can apply for and
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
receive this designation and as a result
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
of that designation um there's an access
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
to an application process for a $5
 
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
million program for infrastructure and
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh for a municipal perun program um and
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
I would say for imagining that most of
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
you having enough familiarity with the
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
housing market in Hampshire that $5
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
million is not going to last very long
 
00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:09.799 align:start position:0%
um but it is I think again an indication
 
00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:12.039 align:start position:0%
of the type of structure and that we can
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
put in place that uh is going to have a
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
positive impact on the longer term
 
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
solution of the program so I hope that's
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
sufficient Mr chairman I'm happy to
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
answer and talk about any other any
 
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
other issues but I do look forward to
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
joining you on future occasions as well
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Commission I appreciate and as
 
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
somebody that helped Champion the
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
housing Champion program thank you for
 
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
the work that you're doing to make sure
 
00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
that we um put those funds in the right
 
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
place so yes sir thank you um any
 
00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:39.559 align:start position:0%
questions for commissioner Caswell
 
00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:41.029 align:start position:0%
questions for commissioner Caswell
representative

00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
Howen thank you um is there anywhere
 
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0%
because I I really was a big fan of the
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
Housing Opportunity grants I think it
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
was a spectacular idea is there anywhere
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
that we can see the uh ordinances that
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
communities passed that were part of the
 
00:21:57.789 --> 00:21:57.799 align:start position:0%
housing Champions just so that everybody
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
can kind of look over and see I mean
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
every Community is different but you can
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
get some Trends out of what kind of path
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be for this
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
committee particularly kind of help
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
there there are some differences but at
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
the same time housing Champions has sort
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
of a standard set of like you have to
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
have certain amount you have to commit
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
to certain level of training for
 
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
planning board members you have to be
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
able to put all of the various
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
components in place not that we have a
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
ton of them but like a 79e type program
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
and some others if those are in place um
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
the standards are mostly pretty static
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
like that but but there might be some
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
areas where there's some subjectivity
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
involved and I think you're right that
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
would be a very instructive component so
 
00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
let me ask my staff if we could come up
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
with a list of that and provide that for
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you that would be
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
great other questions for the
 
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner representative
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair uh Mr Caswell
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
did I understand correctly that um you
 
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
were able to get $60 million out to
 
00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
developers by November of 2022 yeah
 
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
manam uh then I want to compliment you
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
on being able to do that so quickly uh I
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
worked for Department of Housing and
 
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
Urban Development for 29 years myself I
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
recognize your name although I don't we
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
were there at the same time I think we
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
were yes we were yeah um and I know how
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
complicated it can be to get a project
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
started uh and come up with all the
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
agreements and all get all the
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in place so I really want
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
to compliment you on the speed of doing
 
00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
that yes well I very much appreciate
 
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
that representative and it was not an
 
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
easy process I don't know if um Andrew
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
Dorset who is uh our Housing Finance
 
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
director we hired him in July of 2022
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we had contracts in front of Council
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
in November so it was a pretty fast and
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
furious process um but uh one maybe that
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
proof that government can move at a
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
great other
 
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
questions well thank you commissioner I

00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:17.559 align:start position:0%
issue is really really made a priority
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%

Conway um and when I first ran for
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
office it was largely motivated by what

I was seeing in the Mount Washington

harder and harder for young families to
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%

they'll ever be able to build a life for
 
00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
themselves in the town where they grew
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
is my fifth term I've made housing and
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
dealing with the housing crisis my
 
00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
number one issue for the last several
 
00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
years sponsoring 11 housing bills from a
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
variety of different um aspects and
 
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
approaches uh last term alone and um in
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
my opinion it's the most important thing
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
we need to solve in this state and it
 
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
and IT addresses multiple other crises
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
that we have in the state but if if we
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
solve housing then we will solve or at
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
least make strides to S towards solving
 
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
these other
 
00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
issues thank you well welcome um so the
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
charge pursuant to house rule 31 is the
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
duty of the committee on housing to
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
consider subjects related to housing
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
Condominiums landlord tenants rights um
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
residential zoning planning and other
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
matters that may be referred to it
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
there's 10 Republicans eight Democrats
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
on this committee and I've assign
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
seatings with the collaborative goal in
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
mind so you shouldn't be sitting next to
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
all Democrats or all Republicans so
 
00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully we get to know each other um
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
occasionally we'll be assigned bills
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
that come from other committees um but
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
if that's the case it's mainly our job
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
to consider those specific subject areas
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
that we have voted in as um um
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
persistent to housing policy um and
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
occasionally we may may decide to set up
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittees on a bill so um I've
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
scheduled some public hearings for next
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
Tuesday um if it any time the committee
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
feels that we may need to spend some
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
time working on it further um please
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
state that during the public or after
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
the public hearing um we'll have an
 
00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:16.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about that set up a
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee maybe some um members can
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:26.919 align:start position:0%
um I ask that you ask all questions
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
during a public hearing through the
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
chairman so um for example when
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell was here we did a
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
great job with that um I won't tolerate
 
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
debates with Witnesses and unfair
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
questions our job is to ask questions
 
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
evaluate the merits of a bill I'll try
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
to be as Fair as possible to all members
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
but I will not tolerate disrespect to
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
Witnesses or other committee members the
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
public hearing is also not a time to
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
make a speech please save comments for
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
our executive session again I will not
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
tolerate unfair treatment to the public
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
if you're sponsor and you are a member
 
00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:01.079 align:start position:0%
of the committee you may do one of two
 
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
things one you can choose to ask fair
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
questions to Witnesses or two you may
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
testify if you testify you can return to
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
your committee seat but you must remain
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
silent for the entirety of the hearing
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
in cases which I'm the prime sponsor on
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
a bill which there are a few that have
 
00:35:17.069 --> 00:35:17.079 align:start position:0%
been referred to this committee I'll
 
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
defer to the my vice chair to run the
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
public hearing on that bill um
 
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's fair hearing we may
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
take actions action on bills during a
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
public hearing day and pursuant to house
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%

on a bill or if you're in the minority
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
and disagree would like to debate on the
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
floor please write the committee report
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
and send directly to me um pursuant to
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
house rules for approval um I will then
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
send it to committee assistant to get
 
00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
into the house calendar the committee
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
report should outline the majority and
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
minority position on the bill any
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
possible amendments and what they do and
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
the recommendation it's critical we have
 
00:37:05.069 --> 00:37:05.079 align:start position:0%
a full committee during exec sessions so
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
if you cannot be here when a scheduled
 
00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:08.839 align:start position:0%
executive session is happening please
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
contact your partisan office and they
 
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
will find a replacement for us um to
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
conduct that so with that I have a
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
couple more are there any questions I'm
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
just like throwing some information at
 
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
you there's uh quite a bit of um
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
freshman on the committee so I just want
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure I outline some ground rules
 
00:37:26.589 --> 00:37:26.599 align:start position:0%
before we move forward representative
 
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair uh just not so
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
much questions uh just clarification on
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
a couple things the rule about you can
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
only uh act on one side of the table is
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
true of everyone regardless of whether
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
or not you've co-sponsored a bill so you
 
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
had said specifically if you've
 
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
sponsored but it's true of anybody yes
 
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
you can either testify whether you've
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored or not or question and the
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
second piece is it is my understanding
 
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
of best practice that when you submit a
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
a report minority majority or otherwise
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
that that actually goes to both the
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
committee assistant and the chair yes
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
and the committee assistant will not
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
publish it without approval of the
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
chairman um I won't edit substit edit um
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
committee reports but if there are
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
inaccuracies in it I may ask for a
 
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
redraft or to make changes to it
 
00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.470 align:start position:0%
redraft or to make changes to it
representative

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
Paige I think most of what you just
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
covered most most of us here in my
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
caucus are aware of but for our newer
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
members if those notes are something you
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
be willing to share that would be a
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
great shortcut for us and just
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
especially because one of our
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
Representatives is absent today who is a
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
freshman um just to make sure everybody
 
00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
is has the same information up front I
 
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that sounds great of course
 
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
questions okay um so I have asked a few
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
people to um present on housing so um I
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
have asked uh Chris schiler from
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
Elmgrove to um give a brief presentation
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
on the housing crisis and what he's

opportunity um over the last several
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
years I've been involved in in
 
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
testifying like this I've been on the
 
00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:25.319 align:start position:0%

Association Apartment Association of New
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and most recently Manchester's
 
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
uh lead paint commission so um along
 
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
with doing the work of building housing
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
and managing housing I've I've really
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
gotten to know the legislative process
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
pretty well really happy to be asked to
 
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
come and share my perspective on the
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
current situation with the housing
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
market I didn't have a lot of time to
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
prepare and I want to make sure I
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
covered everything so I've written some
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
things down
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would say the hous Market
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is in crisis mode today
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
and has been for several years single
 
00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
family home prices continue to rise the
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
median home price in New Hampshire right
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
now is
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
$520,000 that's double the national
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
average uh there are currently two
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
months of housing stock available on the
 
00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
market when a six months of housing
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
stock is considered
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
healthy rental rates have
 
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
increased 30% over the last few years in
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
2019 the median rent for a two bedroom
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
apartment in New Hampshire was $1,400 a
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
month today it's $1850 and when I spoke
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
for uh representative Cole's uh group
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
six months ago it was
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
1,700 um I will say that either whether
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
it be because of the winter months or um
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
New Stock coming into the market we're
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
seeing prices um
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
stabilize drop a little bit there are
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
some some concessions we see out there
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
in the market right now but I wouldn't
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
count on that to indicate that that
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
we're at the end of um our crisis for
 
00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:09.079 align:start position:0%
rents to go up from $1,400 to
 
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
$1,850 in such a short period of time is
 
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
is dramatic and if you think about it
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
with affordable housing those rents are
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
prescribed the average rent of an
 
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
affordable unit through the litec the
 
00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit program
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
right now is about $1,500 $1600 a month
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's 100 or $200 more than what a
 
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
market rate apartment costs in
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
2019 um it's dramatic I've been doing
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
this for over 20 years I've I've
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
experienced plenty of down markets over
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
that time 2008 um always offering
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
concessions very competitive markets
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
I've never experienced it the way it is
 
00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
now um which is the polar opposite of
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
that vacancy rates are reported to be as
 
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
low as 6% when a healthy Market is
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
5% um our portfolio sits around 2% and
 
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
really the only reason for that I think
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
is because of the time it takes for us
 
00:42:08.589 --> 00:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
to turn Apartments it's also our housing
 
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:11.079 align:start position:0%
challenges are are affecting unemploy
 
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
are affecting employment they're
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
affecting the trades getting people from
 
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
the trades to come to New Hampshire and
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
be able to afford to live here and then
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
do the work that needs to be done to
 
00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
construct and maintain housing um is
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
another side challenge of of our housing
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
troubles where people should be paying
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
30 35% of their income towards housing
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
today the most recent data I saw they're
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
paying as much as 58% of their income
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
toward housing it's that's
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
unsustainable um and if you look at our
 
00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.750 align:start position:0%
unsustainable um and if you look at our
senior

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
senior
 
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
population where there's very little
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
room for income growth all they're doing
 
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
is getting rent increases they're not
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
getting there's no additional income
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
coming in so it's especially challenging
 
00:42:58.549 --> 00:42:58.559 align:start position:0%
for our older um res
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing similar Trends in my
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
portfolio as I mentioned uh we have a 2%
 
00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.190 align:start position:0%
portfolio as I mentioned uh we have a 2%
vacancy

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
vacancy
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
rate our average rent is 4 is
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
$1,873 a month and to give you a
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
perspective of what the supply and
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
demand situation is we have about 35
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
vacant apartments at any given time we
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
we currently own and manage over 1500
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
Apartments throughout New Hampshire
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
um of that about a third is low-income
 
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
housing affordable housing um so even
 
00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
though a large portion of our of our
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
portfolio is is Affordable our rents are
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
still right there at the median for the
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
state in any given month we'll receive
 
00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:46.839 align:start position:0%
450 inquiries for an apartment that's up
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
one month 450 inquiries that's 6,000 or
 
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
so inquiries a year for 35 apartments so
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
we we have no problem renting apartments
 
00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
we have a have challenges getting them
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
rent ready but other than that we have
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
far more people looking for apartments
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
than we can possibly serve homelessness
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
Is On The Rise um and I hope people in
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
the room understand that there's a
 
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
direct correlation between homelessness
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
and housing availability it doesn't
 
00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
really matter what type of housing we
 
00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
build if we build enough housing to
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
create a a healthy housing market
 
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
homelessness will will
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
drop right now viously homelessness Is
 
00:44:31.549 --> 00:44:31.559 align:start position:0%
On The Rise um the latest numbers show a
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
58% increase in in homelessness over the
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
last uh well I should say yesterday's
 
00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:39.079 align:start position:0%
meeting with the housing stability
 
00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
Council was looking at 2023 data they
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
don't have good 2024 data but the the
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
rise in homelessness is is is dramatic
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
and it's I think number one or number
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
four in the entire country number one in
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
the whole whole
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
country it's a
 
00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
problem in order to have a healthy
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
housing market we need 30,000 units
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
today right and over the next 10 years
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
the numbers are 990,000 units we don't
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
need to talk about the 90,000 units how
 
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
are we going to get 30,000 units my
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
company has brought 500 units to Market
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
in the last two years we if we brought a
 
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
thousand units to Market in a year we
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
would think that we had done a fantastic
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
job and been very successful we need 30
 
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
more people or 30 more development
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
developers to do the same
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
thing so my perspective and based on my
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
my time with the housing stability
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
council is the issues that cause this
 
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
right in migration I'm not talking about
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
illegal migration I'm talking about
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
people moving from Massachusetts and
 
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
other states to come to New Hampshire
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
because this is a great state with low
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
taxes great quality of life people are
 
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
moving here because it's less expensive
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
for them to live here in tra and travel
 
00:45:59.710 --> 00:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts for example for their
 
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
for their jobs that alone is is creating
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of competition in the
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
market and driving up prices they're
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
able and willing to pay more in Boston
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
you can rent an apartment for $4,000 a
 
00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
month and it's a good deal you can come
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
here and rent the same apartment for
 
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
$2,000 a month and although it's
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
expensive to us native New Hampshire
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
folks it's it's a bargain for them it's
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
driving up
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
prices it's good for our state too
 
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
though to have 30 ,000 people over the
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
last two years move into our state who
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
are well-educated
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
um family you know people that want to
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
raise a family in our community but we
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
don't have the housing for it inflation
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
over the past few years has dramatically
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
increased costs of owning and caring for
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
Real Estate we've seen increases in in
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
costs of 30% give or take taxes
 
00:46:53.549 --> 00:46:53.559 align:start position:0%
utilities Insurance labor and materials
 
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
across the board and what a lot of
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
people don't realize is that there's a
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
lot of people that have owned real
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
estate multif family housing in the
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
state for many many years and they're
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
now in a market where selling today is
 
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
in their best interest and they're also
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
maybe at the end of their career and
 
00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:10.559 align:start position:0%
they're looking to retire out of it so a
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
lot of real estate is being transferred
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
to new owners including ourselves who
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
are putting a lot of debt on these
 
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
properties that's driving up rents as
 
00:47:21.309 --> 00:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
well I think that's unavoidable but it's
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
a reality of the situation um costs for
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
construction have risen along with
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
inflation interest rates are at
 
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 6 and a half% right
 
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
now so our expenses are are going up
 
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
whether we're constructing new housing
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
or just maintaining the existing housing
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
we have zoning restrictive I'm sorry
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
zoning and restrictive local and state
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
regulations have not adapted to this
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
need at all and there's still a great
 
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
deal of resistance to to change in that
 
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
area many communities in the state are
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
uninterested in approving new housing
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
developments over concerns about
 
00:47:58.349 --> 00:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
mythological issues like Parking School
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
enrollment infrastructure and crime um
 
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
the nimbyism is especially strong when
 
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
it relates to affordable housing now
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
affordable housing is housing built for
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
people that earn between 60 and 80% of
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
area median income affordable housing
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
can be built for people that make 20 30
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
40 50 um% Area immediate income as well
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
but generally defined as between 60 and
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
80% that is for a household in New
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that earns around 50 5 to
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
$75,000 a year that's not low income um
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's hardly low income but the hardest
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
hit populations are for folks especially
 
00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:38.839 align:start position:0%
families that are earning $50,000 a year
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
or less there's no housing at all for
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
that for that segment of the market and
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's a huge segment of the market um
 
00:48:49.549 --> 00:48:49.559 align:start position:0%
housing Choice vouchers are probably the
 
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
um only solution for for people that are
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
making below $30,000 a year and there's
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of real estate owners who um
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
choose not to accept those vouchers um
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
for their own reasons it's a challenging
 
00:49:05.789 --> 00:49:05.799 align:start position:0%
um administratively burdensome
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
um contract to deal with um but they're
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
doing a good job of recognizing that
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
they need to be a partner to landlords
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
and offering some incentives but also
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
just making the the partnership with
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
with property owners um a little bit
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
more uh two-way and uh I think that's
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
going a long way toward getting more
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
Property Owners to accept those vouchers
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
but again somebody has to pay for those
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
vouchers and uh you know as far as I I
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
know we have as many vouchers as we can
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
afford in the state and um I don't know
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
how they'd fund more the solution to
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
building more housing especially
 
00:49:41.359 --> 00:49:42.390 align:start position:0%
building more housing especially
affordable

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
housing is is this uh new zoning
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
ordinances allow for shorter setbacks
 
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
more density more height and fewer
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
single family only zones light density
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
zoning would allow for four units on
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
single family lots um adus by right and
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
fewer parking restrictions there's a lot
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
of C cities throughout the country that
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
have adopted light density and it's not
 
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
as shocking um when it actually goes
 
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
into practice as as as I think a lot of
 
00:50:14.829 --> 00:50:14.839 align:start position:0%
people that live in communities think it
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
um Europe is almost entirely light
 
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.470 align:start position:0%
um Europe is almost entirely light
density

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
density
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
zoning State subsidy if you do anything
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
this year fund
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
fund money to New Hampshire housing to
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%

tax credit program streamlining the
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
permitting process is is is key you know
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
in a healthy Market nobody cares how
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
long it takes for a developer to get a
 
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
project um permitted but it the
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
permitting process as it stands is
 
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
unpredictable it takes a lot of time
 
00:50:59.230 --> 00:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
time is money and there's not a lot
 
00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
of certainty around whether or not a
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
project will will get approved from the
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
beginning so often times a viable
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
project will will will just not be
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
developed out of
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
uncertainty um and we need to educate
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
our local planning and zoning boards on
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
the reality of the housing situation and
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
help them overcome the myths about
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
housing that fuel nimbyism in in our
 
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
communities so New Hampshire Home
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
Builders the housing stability Council
 
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
are two groups that I'm involved with um
 
00:51:32.109 --> 00:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
that have been talking about this issue
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
for years I think they're excellent
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
resources for anyone who wants to
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
understand more about exactly what's
 
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
going on in the housing market here and
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
I recommend that that you reach out to
 
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
members of those groups and and talk to
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
them especially with home builders on
 
00:51:46.589 --> 00:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
the on the development side on the
 
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
construction side they they have a
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
really good handle on what is needed in
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
order to um reduce the costs of
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
Development and Construction and get
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
more housing built
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
that is my testimony thank
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for your uh
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
experiences questions go ahead
 
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks thank you Mr chair
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned a lot and I thank you
 
00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:10.119 align:start position:0%
for your expertise one thing I don't
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
think I heard was short-term rentals or
 
00:52:16.109 --> 00:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
second homes um in New Hampshire and if
 
00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
that is contributing to this problem um
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
could you comment on that
 
00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:25.799 align:start position:0%
briefly so I was at a I saw a speak a
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
speaker recently ly talk about that and
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
he couldn't correlate that there that
 
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals is is causing more
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
issues but I can't imagine that up in
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
the North Country it it doesn't um but I
 
00:52:40.789 --> 00:52:40.799 align:start position:0%
don't know for a fact I I don't know
 
00:52:42.789 --> 00:52:42.799 align:start position:0%
that that's an issue that that is the
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
lowest hanging fruit that we need to
 
00:52:44.559 --> 00:52:45.670 align:start position:0%
lowest hanging fruit that we need to
deal

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
deal
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
with but I would look if I was in the
 
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
North Country I'd look at it more
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
closely um because obviously there's a
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
limited amount of housing up there and
 
00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
and if some of it's set aside for
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
that's going to take away from folks
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
that work up there I don't know if those
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
homes that are being Airbnb up there are
 
00:53:07.789 --> 00:53:07.799 align:start position:0%
in are affordable to people um working
 
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
normal typical jobs in the North Country
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
either so I guess that might be one
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
reason why it it isn't leading aiding in
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
the problem um but it certainly has had
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
an effect I mean Airbnb has has blown up
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
over the my sister owns five of them she
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
would say it's not a problem but I don't
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
know represent kwin thank you chair um
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there was two
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
organizations to look into but I didn't
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
catch what they were oh my uh well on
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
the construction side the New Hampshire
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
Home Builders has a really excellent
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
government Affairs committee um and they
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
seem to have their heads wrapped around
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of the solutions and are are
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
really working with the legislature this
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
year to try to get some of those um in
 
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:47.799 align:start position:0%
the Forefront so they're a great
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
resource Matt Mayberry um and then the
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
housing stability Council which is
 
00:53:55.789 --> 00:53:55.799 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu's Council um we meet
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
monthly we have have breakoff groups
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of data available
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
through that through that group there's
 
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
50 members so lots of conversations I gu
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
I guess the point I want to make about
 
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:10.799 align:start position:0%
those two organizations is um they have
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
different purposes but I have noticed
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't matter what side of the
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
aisle you're on in with with this issue
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
for the most part everybody tends to
 
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
agree on what what the Sol what the
 
00:54:23.549 --> 00:54:23.559 align:start position:0%
solutions are and and really what the
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
problems are what they stem from I think
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
that's really help and uncommon too
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you other questions um
 
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
something that I want to focus on or
 
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
have this committee really dive into is
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of the permitting reforms
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
specifically state level permitting um
 
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
in the perfect world have stability on
 
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
when you want to start a permitting
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
project and have a a set end date um so
 
00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
I have my the committee researcher
 
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
looking into each department and what
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
they require where in the RSA it's
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
required and um or if it's in rules
 
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
where it's required and I guess I'd love
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
your feedback on where because if we're
 
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
going to ask maybe towns to do something
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
and streamline their projects the state
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
also needs to lead on this and so if
 
00:55:15.069 --> 00:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
there's if there's problems on the state
 
00:55:16.589 --> 00:55:16.599 align:start position:0%
level where you're finding that things
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
are taking too long or
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
um uh there's more red tape than that's
 
00:55:23.789 --> 00:55:23.799 align:start position:0%
needed we would love that sort of
 
00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
feedback me specifically um because I
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
see that as a charge of this committee
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
as well is to make sure that our
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
departments are running as smoothly and
 
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
efficiently as possible sure sure so for
 
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
me and my expertise I've been I'm on the
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
property management side of our business
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
and I have been for for 20 years um I
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
have never pulled a permit for anything
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
however um my understanding is that it's
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
the uncertainty about the time the
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
permanent process will take and if there
 
00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
was a 60-day turnaround and let's say
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
after that 60 days often times you could
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
get a denial or you could get a list of
 
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
things that need to be addressed before
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
a permit would be approved and then
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
another 60-day period um extends right
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
so now your 60 turns into 120 I think
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
what we'd be looking for is that we have
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
60 days for a permit to be approved and
 
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
then we get back a list and we have 10
 
00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:21.039 align:start position:0%
days to turn that around rather than
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
extending another 60 days and then
 
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
finding out at the end of that that
 
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
things would be um that or or delayed
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
even further it really there's a
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
carrying cost to to owning um land or or
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
a piece of real estate that you want to
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
develop and you're paying for that every
 
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
single month regardless of whether or
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
not a permit's been been approved and
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
it's that uncertainty that creates um
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
trouble I think for developers John
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
Stevens is putting together a forum that
 
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
we were invited to participate in on um
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
on the permitting process and and
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
working looking to find out ways to
 
00:56:58.109 --> 00:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
streamline that so so um I hope
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
something comes out of that I don't know
 
00:57:01.789 --> 00:57:01.799 align:start position:0%
what it will be but uh we'll have some
 
00:57:04.589 --> 00:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
folks there at that at that Forum that
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
um do this on a reg on a regular
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
basis well you'll be happy to know that
 
00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:11.319 align:start position:0%
I'm coordinating with John Steven on
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
that Forum so wonderful then you can
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
tell us that goes after there was you
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
know there's another piece too that um I
 
00:57:20.029 --> 00:57:20.039 align:start position:0%
was speaking with
 
00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:23.039 align:start position:0%
uh John about and that that has to do
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
with um inspections so the state has uh
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
a process where they they will inspect
 
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
um whether it be Wetlands or or or
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
whatever um and there aren't a lot of
 
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
inspectors at the local level or at the
 
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
state level they're spread very very
 
00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:37.799 align:start position:0%
thin it's like elevator inspectors I
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
think there's two in the entire State of
 
00:57:43.789 --> 00:57:43.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um the idea to somehow
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
allow developers to hire certified
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers inspectors um in
 
00:57:54.029 --> 00:57:54.039 align:start position:0%
their field to to go in for a fee and
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
and and do that work could save a lot of
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
time um and clear up a lot of backlog in
 
00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:03.039 align:start position:0%
the inspection process um while giving
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
the developer an opportunity to either
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
you know go with the state inspector at
 
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
no cost or pay a cost to get something
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
done more quickly um I'm not off the top
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
of my head sure who is um proposing that
 
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
legislation this year but I think we
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
will see something like that and uh it's
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually a pretty smart idea I
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
think it it could work out really well I
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
believe Senator Murphy has a bill in to
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
deal that um CU he brought it up to me
 
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
um it's it's based off of a Florida
 
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
model where you could for a fee hire
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
somebody to to cover the inspection if
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
they're certified through the state or
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
something like that and I think it's an
 
00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
interesting idea the state would have to
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
agree that they're qualified to do that
 
00:58:45.029 --> 00:58:45.039 align:start position:0%
obviously um but it's a great idea I
 
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
think other
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none thank
 
00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:53.039 align:start position:0%
you thank you apprciate
 
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
it okay so I'm we're running a bit ahead
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
of schedule I had originally asked for
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
Rob dais from New Hampshire housing to
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
come but I don't see him in the room
 
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:04.630 align:start position:0%
right now
so

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure maybe take a quick break
 
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
maybe like 10 15 minutes and then we'll
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.039 --> 01:00:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
just

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:54.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:24.910 align:start position:0%

Housing and title I can't remember but
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
Jack and I work closely together on

legislative affairs to help share
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%

questions you may have so we'll spend 10
 
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
or 15 minutes talking about who we are
 
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
and what we do um and be happy to take
 
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
any questions after that uh before I
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
start I just want to say thank you for
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
your service to the state and for your
 
01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
uh work and Leadership on on this
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
important issue um we have some handouts
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
going around and so hopefully those will
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
make the rounds and if there's extras um
 
01:20:51.629 --> 01:20:51.639 align:start position:0%
maybe we can share them with folks in
 
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
the audience but that's uh three
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
documents first just our most recent
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
annual report and that might be useful
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
to refer to while I'm talking uh then an
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
a fact sheet on the affordable housing
 
01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
fund which is one of the resources at
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
the state level that we are the stewards
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
of and then uh information sheet uh that
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
came out of a recent uh research project
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
that we did with respect to the number
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
of school children that are enrolled in
 
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
local public schools when new housing is
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
built um so uh without further Ado I'll
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you who we are and and New
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing maybe it's uh helpful
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
to First say what we are not we're not a
 
01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
state agency we're not part of state
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
government uh and we're often confused
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
for a state agency which is
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
understandable because we run a lot of
 
01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
programs that sort of look uh
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
governmental and are in their nature but
 
01:21:38.830 --> 01:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh we were established about 40 years
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
ago by state law uh as an independent
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
self-supporting Corporation we have a
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
mission to promote finance and support
 
01:21:48.430 --> 01:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
Housing Solutions uh for the people of
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and when we were created
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
as an independent entity it was sort of
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
part of a national Trend uh that was uh
 
01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
where States created these independent
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
bodies to take advantage of new federal
 
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
tax provisions and issue mortgages that
 
01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
helped encourage home ownership for
 
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
first time and moderate income home
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
buyers and basically the states didn't
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
want all that debt on their books and so
 
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
that's kind of you know the inelegant
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
origin story but I think for a number of
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
reasons uh that we can get into it's
 
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
worked out pretty well and that over the
 
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
years as either new programs have
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
emerged on the federal level or the
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
state has had you know housing work that
 
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be done they've turned to us
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
and asked us to do that and and and
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
we've been able to help uh perhaps at
 
01:22:27.629 --> 01:22:27.639 align:start position:0%
times in ways that uh you know
 
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
demonstrated more agility or uh
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
flexibility than we might have been able
 
01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
to um to employ uh had we been a state
 
01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
agency uh we are organized into three
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
operational divisions and at this time
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
if you want to you can pull uh pull out
 
01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
your annual report there um so I'll tell
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
you quickly what they are and what they
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
and and what they each do uh the first
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
in our guide is multif family housing
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
and this is probably of the most visible
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
aspect of our work
 
01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
um it's where I worked so I've been at
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing for 10 years
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
before that I worked for North Branch
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
construction here in conquer uh so I was
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
sort of building homes and I switch
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
sides of the table uh but still work
 
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
closely with Builders uh developers both
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
for-profit and nonprofit all over the
 
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
state to uh help create and preserve
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
affordable homes for the people of New
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um a lot of people have a
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
lot of different ideas and in some cases
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
stigma associated with what affordable
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
housing is and looks like and a lot of
 
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
that comes from sort of the legacy of
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
public housing which hasn't been built
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
in this country in many decades and uh
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of complicated reasons
 
01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to get into about why
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
public housing has sort of uh an
 
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunate Legacy in ter in people's
 
01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
minds and understanding of what that
 
01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
housing is and means um but the housing
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
that we're financing now and that we're
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
helping uh independent developers and
 
01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
Builders to create has very little in
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
common with that housing uh essentially
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
what this uh housing uh properties like
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
the ones that you see in these pages
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh the way they come together is that
 
01:23:59.629 --> 01:23:59.639 align:start position:0%
developers compete and we allocate below
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
Market Capital whether that's through
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
tax credits or a affable housing fund
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
debt or tax exempt uh debt which is
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
funded by Bond buyers on the private and
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
public markets um they accept that below
 
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
Market capital in exchange for a uh
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
binding commitment to rent those new
 
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
apartments that they're creating to
 
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
people who are uh not rich low or
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
moderate income for rents that they can
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
afford they also commit to accepting
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
housing Choice vouchers AKA Section 8
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
vouchers if that's how uh the resident
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
is paying their rent and uh if you've
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
never been to a uh affordable property
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's been financed in the last say
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
decade I highly encourage you to get
 
01:24:38.189 --> 01:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
there reach out to us and we'll be happy
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
to coordinate but these are um you know
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're not fancy but they're beautiful
 
01:24:43.149 --> 01:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
places that I think any one of us could
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
be proud to call home that people are
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
proud to call their homes um and that's
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
not what everybody sort of thinks of
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
when you think about uh affordable or
 
01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
public housing in the past um there's a
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
lot of numbers a lot pictures you can
 
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
take your time with it and reach out
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
with questions if you'd like I will just
 
01:24:59.790 --> 01:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
mention one other aspect of it which is
 
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
we do a fair amount of uh work on
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing so housing for people
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
who need uh Supportive Services to
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
maintain their housing and stability and
 
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
improve their lives whether that's folks
 
01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
with uh substance substance use
 
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
disorders mental illness developmental
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities people who have experienced
 
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
homelessness um veterans uh in in some
 
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
cases and so on um and and many some of
 
01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
those do care
 
01:25:27.149 --> 01:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
you know a deep rent subsidy uh so it's
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
not just you know a rent that would be
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
affordable to somebody at 80% of area
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
median income or something like that um
 
01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
and most recently we've agreed at the
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
state's request or at the request of the
 
01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:40.280 align:start position:0%
opioid commission chaired by Senator
 
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald to uh administer an opioid use
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
disorder uh funding program so we're we
 
01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:47.719 align:start position:0%
just issued a notice of funding
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for creators of recovery and
 
01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing for folks with that
 
01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
particular um who struggle with that
 
01:25:57.629 --> 01:25:57.639 align:start position:0%
condition uh uh and and are looking
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
forward to working with again uh
 
01:26:00.910 --> 01:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
developers and Recovery housing
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
providers across the state uh to to get
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
that money which came from the
 
01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
settlements from like the pharmacies and
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
drug companies uh out out to help the
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
people who that crisis has
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
affected I will keep moving in the
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
interest of time I before I do the
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fact sheet that you
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
have I'm not going to get into all the
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
details of the affordable housing fund
 
01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
there's legislation introduced and
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
obviously there will be a conversation
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
as part of the budget about whether
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh that uh you know additional funding
 
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
is in order for the affordable housing
 
01:26:31.149 --> 01:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
fund but that's a state level trust fund
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
that we administer on behalf of the
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
State uh right now the first $5 million
 
01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
in real estate transfer tax money goes
 
01:26:39.550 --> 01:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
to the affordable housing trust fund we
 
01:26:41.709 --> 01:26:41.719 align:start position:0%
essentially uh the federal programs that
 
01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
do the bulk of the work in terms of
 
01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
financing new or preserved affordable
 
01:26:48.669 --> 01:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
housing are uh designed to not fund the
 
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
whole thing so you have to get private
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
debt you have to get State money um the
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund allows us to to
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
uh fully utilize uh at at best uh fully
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
utilize um or at least leave Less on the
 
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
table in terms of tax exempt Bond
 
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
financing and uh low-income housing tax
 
01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
credit that the uh federal government
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
allocates to us on a sort of per capita
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
allocation and that's part of the
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
permanent federal tax
 
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
code I'll move on to home ownership uh
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
home ownership is sort of again like how
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
we began and I like to mention that this
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
is how when my family moved to New
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 13 14 years ago uh we bought
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
our first home with a New Hampshire
 
01:27:29.070 --> 01:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
housing uh VA loan long before I knew uh
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
anything else about New Hampshire
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
housing uh we're not a retail lender so
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
you can't come to New Hampshire Housing
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
and get a loan we're essentially a
 
01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
wholesale lender so we compete with like
 
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
big National firms like rocket mortgage
 
01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
and United Wholesale Mortgage that are
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh and and we provide opportunities
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
for local lenders whether that's uh
 
01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
Banks like Meredith Village or Marat
 
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
County uh walpool Savings Bank or
 
01:27:55.229 --> 01:27:55.239 align:start position:0%
mortgage companies like Pinnacle
 
01:27:58.990 --> 01:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
Mortgage uh to offer products to their
 
01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
clients uh that particularly for
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
first-time home buyers I mean they're
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
they're generally limited to first-time
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
home buyers and people who uh meet
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
income uh requirements but because
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
they're financed with tax exempt bonds
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
um you know people buy those Bonds on
 
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
the or investors buy those Bonds on the
 
01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:18.280 align:start position:0%
public market and pay a premium because
 
01:28:19.950 --> 01:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
their their Dividends are tax exempt
 
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
that makes the debt a little bit cheaper
 
01:28:24.189 --> 01:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
and so uh you know we're generally uh
 
01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
one percentage Point 100 basis points
 
01:28:27.550 --> 01:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
lower than what the market is it varies
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
a lot depending on the specific program
 
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
and what you're putting down uh you know
 
01:28:33.109 --> 01:28:33.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of these are FHA or low down
 
01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
payment loans but not all of them so it
 
01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:37.239 align:start position:0%
just allows people to achieve home
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
ownership um in in what is really a very
 
01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
very competitive market as I'm sure
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
you've all heard and are probably
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
Hearing in other presentations there's
 
01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
very limited inventory and home prices
 
01:28:51.550 --> 01:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
have um have gone crazy in the last
 
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
couple years frankly um we also
 
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh so I mentioned uh I don't know if I
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned down payment assistance is a
 
01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
component of these loans and that's not
 
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know State money it's it's uh
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
essentially The Profit that we make by
 
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
issuing these bonds we put back into the
 
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
bond indentures and offer down payment
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
assistance of5 10 or
 
01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
$15,000 so that because we so often see
 
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
renters who are paying you know $2,000
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
$2500 a month in rent in some markets uh
 
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
but and and it's not no mystery about
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
why they can't save for a down payment
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
and so uh down payment assistance which
 
01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
goes in as a uh a soft second
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
essentially it's a uh loan that is only
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
repayable upon sale or refinance of that
 
01:29:39.310 --> 01:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
mortgage um and we have precautions to
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
make sure people don't get underwater
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
and get hurt um but but that helps a lot
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
of people achieve home ownership as well
 
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
I'll move on to assisted housing the
 
01:29:49.709 --> 01:29:49.719 align:start position:0%
assisted housing division uh essentially
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
serves as the public housing authority
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
for areas of the state that don't have a
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
local public housing authority that
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
means we administer the housing Choice
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
voucher a Section 8 program which is
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
entirely federally funded through the
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
HUD budget um so there's 17 phas
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
actually you might a lot of people don't
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
realize but of course Manchester you
 
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
know conquered Nashua do Portsmouth have
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
their own uh PHA but also some smaller
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
communities um like summersworth and uh
 
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
Berlin and others um there's about 10 or
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
12,000 vouchers in the state and we
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
administer uh roughly third of them uh
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know I think the important thing to
 
01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
understand about this it serves uh if
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
you look at sort of the incomes and
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
demographics of the families that we
 
01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
serve with these various programs this
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
is by far the lowest income and most
 
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
vulnerable the median income of the
 
01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
folks that we help it's not I thought it
 
01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
was in our oh yeah there it is
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
9,260 largely people on fixed income uh
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
78% are seniors or people with a
 
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
disability many of them both uh this
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
program has historically been a really
 
01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
important tool to help people who are at
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
a difficult time in their lives who may
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
be experiencing housing instability or
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
homelessness um I think the important
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
thing for all of us to understand is
 
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
that because uh rents have increased a
 
01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:06.280 align:start position:0%
lot and we're paying that rent on behalf
 
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
of the voucher holders uh their income
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
has not increased very much as I said
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
most of them are on a fixed income uh
 
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
the budget has increased a little bit
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
but um but not a whole lot and so used
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
to be we had a waiting list of maybe
 
01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
four or 5,000 people and you could uh
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
reasonably expect that if you signed up
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
and were eligible you might might get a
 
01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
voucher in four or five years which is
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
hard that's a hard message to deliver
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
but um you know you can maybe see that
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
in the Horizon at this point um we have
 
01:31:35.229 --> 01:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
a waiting list that's ballooned to 7,000
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
and uh for those who sign up with you
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
know just sort of like regular eligible
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
people even if they're experiencing
 
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
homelessness but they're not they don't
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
have a preference because they're you
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
know referred by DHHS and avoiding
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
nursing home care or terminally ill is
 
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
another one you know there's a few
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
preferences that will get you a voucher
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
in a year or something but apart from
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
that it's um you know it might be 8
 
01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
years and it might be never because of
 
01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
the other folks who are coming onto the
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
um onto the pro program with I guess
 
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
what's categorized as more urgent needs
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
and so we just need to be realistic
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
about the ability of that Federal
 
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
program to sort of serve as a stop Gap
 
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
and prevent homelessness in the
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
state um that's our three operational
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
divisions there is a fourth uh team
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
which is small and mighty and does a lot
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
of important work that may be also
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
visible to you and Jack is actually a
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
member of that team so I'm going to turn
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
over him to talk a bit about uh
 
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
engagement policy and
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
Communications super thanks Rob uh and
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
good day everybody it's sort of in
 
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
between good morning and good afternoon
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
my name is Jack rudderman and I serve as
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing's energy and
 
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs advisor which means
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
I'll be spending a lot of time in this
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
building and in this room uh this coming
 
01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.270 align:start position:0%
building and in this room uh this coming
legislative

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
session I want to tell you just a little
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
bit about our engagement policy and
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
Communications Group and and what we do
 
01:32:57.629 --> 01:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
um we produce research on key housing
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
issues um like a school enrollment study
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
that was recently completed uh assessing
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
the impact of housing on School
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment uh and then uh on local tax
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
rates uh we published a municipal guide
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
to RSA 79e which is the community re
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
revitalization tax relief
 
01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
incentive um the state housing needs
 
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
assessment uh and also the annual
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
residential rental cost survey which
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
tells us what housing costs are for
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
renters and home buyers across the NES
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
across the state so it really gives
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
gives policy makers and the public um uh
 
01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
and other stakeholders uh a detailed
 
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
portrait of the housing market um and it
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
it does it you know by each County
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and you see a fair
 
01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
amount of variability but um if you're
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
reading in the paper um that the vacancy
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
rate is
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
x% uh or median rents for a two-bedroom
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
apartment has gone up by 38% usually the
 
01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
source of that is is this survey which
 
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
is done
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
annually we also serve as a resource for
 
01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
towns and cities that are seeking local
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
solutions to the housing crisis so we
 
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
work closely with several Regional
 
01:34:23.709 --> 01:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing coalitions around
 
01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
around the state and we also manag the
 
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
state's Housing Opportunity planning
 
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
grants program or the The Hop grants as
 
01:34:35.109 --> 01:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
some of you may have heard um and that
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
program uh has provided funding to more
 
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
than 60 communities um they've received
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
grant funding uh which came to us by way
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
of uh invest New Hampshire uh Governor
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
shu's initiative um on the housing front
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
um and what the communities do with
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
these funds is they first conduct a
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
housing needs assessment to figure out
 
01:35:02.109 --> 01:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
what are the needs within our own
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
particular Community um and then they
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
look at their zoning ordinances and and
 
01:35:09.790 --> 01:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
all local land use
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
ordinances um to explore ways to remove
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
barriers to increasing the supply of
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
housing at the local level so um that
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
program really um has grown very quickly
 
01:35:24.510 --> 01:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh and a lot of work is being carried
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
out um uh at the local level um and this
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
is a a program um that we feel is is
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
having an impact and will continue to
 
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
have a a significant impact uh over the
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
course of the next few years so that's
 
01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
just a a quick look um at the work we do
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the um EPC division uh and with that
 
01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn it back to
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
Rob and that pretty much covers it in
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
terms of who we are and what we do I you
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
know intentionally haven't talked about
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
the housing market I think you're
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
getting other presentations on that but
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's another area where we're happy to
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
be a resource because we have all these
 
01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
Partners in different uh sort of corners
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
of the housing uh industry and and
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
Market uh I think we can help to sort of
 
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that you're making the best
 
01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
informed decisions you can but with that
 
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:15.000 align:start position:0%

01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
