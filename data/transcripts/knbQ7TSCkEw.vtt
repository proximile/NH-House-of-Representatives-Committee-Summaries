Park Resort in Grant County thank
 
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
item sure uh so before you there are um
 
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
sort of three major tranches of capital
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
plan improvements first of which is uh
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
the approval and the recommendation of
 
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure improvements asphalt
 
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
shingle roof repairs to our primary skia
 
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
Services lodges um in the amount of
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
190,000 secondly would be the some lift
 
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance repair items including uh B
 
00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
wi bearing to our main detach lift a
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
Communications line um upgrade and then
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
um a gearbox rebuild to our Eagle Cliff
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
fix grip triple lift at the base area
 
00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
and then lastly we have a uh Mainline
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
replacement covers uh a couple hundred
 
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
meters um from our snow making Pump
 
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
House all the way to essentially what is
 
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
the base of our skur services right near
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
our um Eagle Cliff notchview Lodge area
 
00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:47.959 align:start position:0%
this is to address some of the corrosion
 
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
and pinhole issues that we have along
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
that section of the line it'd be
 
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
important to note that that entire
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
project right now is estimated to be
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
around 456,000 um what was approved by
 
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
the Canam advisory Commission in June
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
was the amount of
 
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.550 align:start position:0%
was the amount of
226,000

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
226,000
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
and that's because uh we just recently
 
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
received approval through the land
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
waterer conservation fund grant program
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
so Federal Monies to cover half of that
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
cost um we received approval on that
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
Grant last week um so half that project
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
would be uh requested um here in thank
 
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
motion motion's been moved second and
 
00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:44.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
24010 uh if you're in favor of that
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
motion signify by saying I I opposed
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
motion carries
 
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
unanimously uh before before you leave
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner could you give give us an
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
update of where we are with the uh with
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
the Tramway
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
itself absolutely um
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
so about four years ago I brought up the
 
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
tram to the capital budget um committee
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
um sort of waving my hands and saying
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're approaching the end of its life um
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
which is about 40 plus years and this
 
00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:23.079 align:start position:0%
would be a request for a third iteration
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
of the tram um we worked closely with
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
legislators um and
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
we gleaned information from vendors to
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
come up with an estimation of what the
 
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
price would be that was about 2 years
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
ago um and we successfully were uh
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
approved for $18
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
million um we thought at that time that
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
the the whole tram package would cost
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
about $25 million um and we could make
 
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
up the the difference with Park funds
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
Etc um the reality is when we went out
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
to bid it the bid came back at 33
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
million um and so we're working with um
 
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
with our colleagues at Das DPW we've
 
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
talked commissioner Arling house to keep
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
him up to speed and right now what we're
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
doing is stepping back and um and and
 
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
trying to create opportunity to break up
 
00:12:23.069 --> 00:12:23.079 align:start position:0%
the the bid so with the hope that we can
 
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:26.839 align:start position:0%
um create a validation on the concrete
 
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
polls uh that are up the the Tramway to
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
reduce the price if those concrete poles
 
00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:35.959 align:start position:0%
are safe and have a long life ahead of
 
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
them that would allow for a new bid that
 
00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
would dramatically reduce the price um
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
and so uh we're taking on that next sort
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
of chapter of breaking apart the bid I'm
 
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
going to ask um director Brian Wilson if
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
there's anything else I need to add to
 
00:12:51.959 --> 00:12:53.430 align:start position:0%
there's anything else I need to add to
that

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
summary I would our Capital request for
 
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.710 align:start position:0%
summary I would our Capital request for
the

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
next it is priority for our next Capital
 
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.710 align:start position:0%
next it is priority for our next Capital
request

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
um it really is a state decision uh the
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
tram has become an iconic uh tourist
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
attraction of course we want it
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
selfishly for the revenue for state
 
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
parks which is operationally self-funded
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's a big big piece of Revenue that
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
said you know we had people come and
 
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
testify as far away as Hampton Beach to
 
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
say you know when you invested in the
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
seashell at the beach it really did a
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
big uh Improvement to the local economy
 
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
if you invest in this you know we would

something that the committee's allowed
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
for a number of years now because of the
 
00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
um infrequency of meeting and the
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
repairs that might come particularly
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
during wintertime when damage comes from
 
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:53.480 align:start position:0%

money for the Powder Mill that said that
 
00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:24.039 align:start position:0%
they needed to do the Powder Mill
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
project first and then any balance
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
remaining could be used Statewide for
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
Hatchery purposes this memo is um the
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
Department's way of showing the
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
committee that you they've done what was
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
asked of them and so it breaks out what
 
00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
they think they would need for Powder
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
Mill and then what they plan on using
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
the rest of the funds for they're still
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
in the process of um getting bids and
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
and getting the exact cost related to
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
that um but it is to give the committee
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
um a sense of what they you know that
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
they did meet the requirement that was
 
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
provided to them um I do have some
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
additional information I can hand out to
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
the committee related to the hatchery in
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
terms of some of the costs and I'll do
 
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
that when I'm done speaking but if you
 
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
do want to hear from them they are
 
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
here um the second item is the
 
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
administrative Services quarterly report
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
the only notation there is that um the
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
community college system reports
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
information on the capital budget
 
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation that they have in this
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
quarterly report however there's a note
 
00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget that requires a a
 
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
more detailed in information there was
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
some confusion they thought they were
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
meeting the requirements
 
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
um through this report after having a
 
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
discussion with members of the community
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
college system they're going to provide
 
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:36.919 align:start position:0%
a more detailed report for your next
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
meeting but just wanted to make sure
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
that they the committee understood that
 
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
they thought they were meeting the
 
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
requirement that's why you hadn't seen
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
something more detailed um we just
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
discussed the P's one real quickly and
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
then the last item is the Department of
 
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue item and it's really the second
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
side of that is is what's important to
 
00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
this committee which was the um funding
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
mechanism for the Department's computer
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
system rims and how they um get revenue
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
from that to pay for their bonds so I
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
just it's a high view if you want to
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
detail questions like I said there are
 
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
people here from Dr as well as fishing
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
