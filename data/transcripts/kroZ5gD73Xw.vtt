excellent uh a lot of the work we do is
 
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.830 align:start position:0%
excellent uh a lot of the work we do is
in

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and since the committee is
 
00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:00.919 align:start position:0%
smaller this year we're down to three
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittees there's the pension
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which representative Lon is
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
chair of the licensing subcommittee
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
which representative Pearson is chair of
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
and then representative Sheen has other
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
which at the moment looks like it will
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
be the State Building Code because we've
 
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
got four or five bills on it and at
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if you um there's a list of
 
00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members and the office if
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
you have very strong objections let me
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
know or find somebody to trade places
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
with uh I try to assign them based on
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
your interests as much as I knew of
 
00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
them so we yeah Jackie so I do have I
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
thought maybe we might elaborate a
 
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:49.720 align:start position:0%
little bit on the state building codes
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
because we're not having an orientation
 
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
on that and um I'm not sure if everybody
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
is aware of what the state building
 
00:08:59.550 --> 00:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
codes signify and what they represent
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
present and I think that
 
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
um it's something that um
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
historically we have uh well on my first
 
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
term it was a it was a big uh it was a
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
big issue because we hadn't adopted the
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
um we hadn't adopted the latest building
 
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
codes I think my first ter was it was
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
2019 and I don't I think we were
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
reviewing the 2016 building codes but we
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
hadn't adopted them since
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
2013 was it had been quite a while so as
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
a result of that this committee made a
 
00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
commitment to itself that we would
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
always stay current with the building
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
codes but we would not adopt the newest
 
00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
building codes we would adopt the
 
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
previous ones because the um those
 
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
building codes can some can sometimes
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
have bugs in them you know like little
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
things that you don't expect so it gives
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
us a um it gives us codes that are Curr
 
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
but have been reviewed by
 
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
other um towns who may have adopted the
 
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
building codes so the if I remember if
 
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
I'm correct about this towns have to
 
00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:15.399 align:start position:0%
adopt the building the ad the the ones
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
that we um the state the legislature
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
adopts however nothing prevents them
 
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
from going beyond the current ones so if
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
they want to adopt the newer ones they
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
can yes right we yes that's General
 
00:10:31.949 --> 00:10:31.959 align:start position:0%
generally true we made some changes this
 
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
past year when we adopted the 2021 codes
 
00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
um we changed that towns that wish to
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
make amendments to the building code
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
have to do so formally by a vote of
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
their um I think it's the legisl I think
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's their governing body so the board
 
00:10:58.509 --> 00:10:58.519 align:start position:0%
of Selectmen can vote to adopt a change
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
to the building code but they have to
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
send it into the State Building Code
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
Review Board in order and which will
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
publish it so people know the idea of
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
the state building code is that it's a
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
State Building Code and every town and
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
City should be using the same code with
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
possibly some minor changes there are
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
places in the codes where you have
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
options you know you can do it A or B
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
and some towns decided Well we really
 
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
like be better so we'd like to have the
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
local option to do it that way which is
 
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.310 align:start position:0%
local option to do it that way which is
reasonably

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
reasonably
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
legitimate but the difficulty has been
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
that many municipalities were not
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
formally adopting their code changes and
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
were not publishing them so a lot of
 
00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:55.399 align:start position:0%
people that were trying to build were
 
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
surprised when the inspector said oh
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
that doesn't meet the town Coast you
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
can't do it that way you've got to fix
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
it and there are
 
00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
allegations that some inspectors were
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
making it up as they went
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
along which I which I believe may have
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
happened I'm not don't know any that
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
happened to me deliberately but there
 
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
were enough comments of that sort that I
 
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
believe that it has happened so we're
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
trying to make it easier to build in
 
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
that you know what the rules are before
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
you go
 
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.949 align:start position:0%
you go
in

00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
and um and and I'm a me I last term was
 
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
a member of the building code review
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
board liaison committee which met with
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
the building code review board which is
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
a uh a panel of experts there are no
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
legislators on it there are Architects
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
and Engineers plumber and electricians
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
and home builders commercial
 
00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
Builders and Architects I think oh yeah
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
definitely Architects so they know the
 
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
building codes they use them and they're
 
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
the ones
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
that provide us the State Building Code
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
but we have to ratify
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
it and this so this year we
 
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
have uh at least four bills on the
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
building code
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
and ex officio I'm sponsored of at least
 
00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:33.399 align:start position:0%
one of them which consolidates all the
 
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement materials about the building
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
code which had been scattered through
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
the town authorities and the city
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
authorities and the Fire Marshals
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
Authority and put it in one place with
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
the building code so that it
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
um you you could go and see who is
 
00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
enforcing it in your
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
town um if anyone in uh my town we have
 
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
a zoning compliance officer who checks
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
for the location of the driveway
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
clearance around the
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
well uh proper position of the septic
 
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:13.959 align:start position:0%
system and that's about it he doesn't
 
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
inspect the house that we built for for
 
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.069 align:start position:0%
inspect the house that we built for for
Code

00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
Code
 
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:21.079 align:start position:0%
Compliance so um and that is not
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
uncommon in small towns in fact having a
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
compliance officer that actually checks
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
well clearances and septics system
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
some uh what else so that's the
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
consolidation Bill we have a bill
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh from that will update the state
 
00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:45.829 align:start position:0%
uh from that will update the state
energy

00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:47.949 align:start position:0%
energy
code

00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:47.959 align:start position:0%
code
 
00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:50.759 align:start position:0%
uh which was not updated when we did the
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
rest of the building code we have a bill
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
to restrict Municipal adoption of
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
building code
 
00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:02.839 align:start position:0%
changes and then there's a fourth bill
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
that I don't remember at the moment but
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
them oh and update the electrical code
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you that's on a different
 
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
cycle so we we will be having all of
 
00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:18.759 align:start position:0%
those bills heard on the same day and
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
I'll leave time on at least one of them
 
00:15:23.749 --> 00:15:23.759 align:start position:0%
for people to get their questions out
 
00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:25.759 align:start position:0%
about the codes and the
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
processes the thing about building codes
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
there's they have two different types
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
safely and how to and in particular the
 
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
updates tell you how to use new
 
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
materials and processes because the
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
original building code we had was for
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
say was for stick build houses as time
 
00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:53.959 align:start position:0%
went on it developed how to
 
00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:56.839 align:start position:0%
use pre-built presses which is a
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
different building Style but so we
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's covered in the current codes um
 
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
and then there
 
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
are um manufactor specific requirements
 
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
that keep getting thrown in and in some
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
cases the building code goes from M you
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
know manufacturer A's materials to
 
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturer B's materials back and
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
forth when really they ought to be
 
00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:23.959 align:start position:0%
alternates because they're both both
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
safe and effective but you do you deal
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
any any contractors plumbers or
 
00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:34.759 align:start position:0%
electricians in the
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
group okay well darn I'm no but I was an
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
architecture minor and I love this stuff
 
00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:42.189 align:start position:0%
architecture minor and I love this stuff
okay

00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
excellent yeah I'm I'm a mechanical
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
engineer by training so I that's how I
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
got stuck with it Edna got it some years
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
ago uh because we had on the on the
 
00:16:58.309 --> 00:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
committee a representative who was a
 
00:17:01.389 --> 00:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
master plumber and a master electrician
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
so he really knew what was going on with
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
the codes and he was basically the lead
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
for the whole house for um as long as he
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
elected yeah I just wanted to add that
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
building codes are a rather animated
 
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
subject so that we will get a lot of
 
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%
testimony on those because they're
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
integral in our everyday life right and
 
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
um often time it's I we would I would I
 
00:17:35.549 --> 00:17:35.559 align:start position:0%
support a Statewide building code
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
because I would want houses that are
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
built in you know let's say the town of
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
Franklin or Milford to be as safe as
 
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
those that we build
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so um I think and it's also
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
good for people who are buying houses
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
because if they have an inspection one
 
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
of the things the inspector will look
 
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
for is whether or not the house is code
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
compliant so it's good for the owners to
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
know that we have State Building
 
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
Code yeah okay John thank you a question
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
on that how does that apply to
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
properties that have houses that have
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
already been built and for 50 100 150
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
years there is
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
existing building building code that
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
directs how you um
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
update if as long as you don't make any
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
major changes to house it's your
 
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
business but if you've got 1940s and 50s
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
electrical circuits I recommend you
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
change them just for your own safety um
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
the in fact as long as you keep owning
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
it there's no problem if you sell the
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
house the new I don't know if you make M
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
changes though there you will have to in
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
some cases bring parts of the house up
 
00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:00.390 align:start position:0%
some cases bring parts of the house up
to

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
compliance and for commercial buildings
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's also somewhat more ex
 
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
extensive and that's that's an issue
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%

rules and the jail car since especially
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
since we're going to be talking with
 
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:31.400 align:start position:0%

lot of overlap between a Jael car and um

and Edna that's one of the things I
 
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
think you'll all enjoy and profit from
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
is that we have a lot to do with uh
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
state agencies and and state rules and
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
so forth and we will see a lot of the
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
top people there one of them is with us
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
this morning to speak to us at some
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
point Allison is on by your HHS right by
 
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
um jelar stands for joint legislative
 
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rues rules
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh and um many statutes require kind of
 
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
instruction manual on how they are to be
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
implemented and those are called
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and uh the
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
legislature gives up a portion of its
 
00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:46.039 align:start position:0%
power to the um to the various different
 
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
state agencies in order to oversee uh
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
those specific areas such as Health and
 
00:20:57.149 --> 00:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
Human Services uh and um in order to
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that the agency is staying
 
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
within its powers the rules that it
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
devises for implementing statutes have
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
to go through the jail car for approval
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
um and there are three members of this
 
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:14.440 align:start position:0%

committee who are currently on the jail
car

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
car
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire is the just uh
 
00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
previous chair of the jail car uh as a
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
member of the House there are five house
 
00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
members and five senate members on the
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
Jael car um and It Go the chair goes
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
back and forth between the the two
 
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
Chambers representative Maguire was the
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
chair in the previous term from the from
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
the house and now it's the Senate's term
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
and so repres Senator Lang is the chair
 
00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:47.559 align:start position:0%
at this particular time the chair of the
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
jail car is chosen by the members uh
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
elected from either the senate or the
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
house um and um so and also
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative Gro is on the on the
 
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
currently on the Jael car along with me
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative Leon representative
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
Maguire and um so th this term and the
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
name will come up very frequently on
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
administrative rule issues so um it's an
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
advantage to this committee to have
 
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
several members who understand the
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
process quite well uh and um and
 
00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
therefore they can help the other
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to understand
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
more easily and speak to that from point
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
of experience we also have a couple of
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
members on the joint committee on
 
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
on classification on committee on
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm blanking on it the joint
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
committee on employee classification
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
employee classification thank you I'm
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
used to calling it
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
JCC um two members of the jccr by
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
Statute from this committee one Democrat
 
00:22:59.950 --> 00:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
and one Republican and I'm currently on
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
the JCC as well from the Democratic side
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
and um the previous Republican member
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
didn't get reelected so we were going to
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
have to appoint somebody some republican
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
from this committee by Statute will have
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
to be on there the former um member was
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
represented scitec when he was on this
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee but he wasn't on this
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
committee last term so he couldn't be on
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
continue on the jce because it has to be
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
two members from Edna one Democrat one
 
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
Republican so I'm hoping representa
 
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
scitec will come back because he's the
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
longest serving member of
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
JCC um now that Senator de dallesandro
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
has retired after 15 50 years in the in
 
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:49.830 align:start position:0%
the what he means is I keep the
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.669 align:start position:0%
the what he means is I keep the
[Laughter]

00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
minutes yes thank you we will have a
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
probably weeks after that we we meet on
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays and
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
Thursdays uh we don't need a Corum for
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
public hearings so if you need to or you
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
have other conflict
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
feel free to skip them they're all
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
televised so you can catch up if you
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
um on and as a warning on February
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
12th I'm scheduling uh some lighter
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
bills we have
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
a state animated film which we will be
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
showing immediately after lunch when we
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
and then considering the bill that um
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
that goes that recommends it as a state
 
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
film we have the state a new state flag
 
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
design we have a committee on flag
 
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
design and
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
um and Daniel Webster day plus another
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
bill on General
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
holidays um they're all on that day um
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
if you want to go skiing that's one I'd
 
00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
recommend it's it's they're all very
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh very light in fact I've invited
 
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
fourth graders from from one of my towns
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
to come talk to us about the flag
 
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
because in my opinion their judgment of
 
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
the flag quality is at least as good as
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
better excuse
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
me other than that I'm waiting till we
 
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
get more bills at the moment the speaker
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
said there's something like 200 more
 
00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.830 align:start position:0%
said there's something like 200 more
bills

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
that haven't been written and assigned
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
to committees so and looking at them it
 
00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
looks like the tough ones are the ones
 
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0%
that are coming out last and they're
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
more likely to be early bills so the
 
00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:46.519 align:start position:0%
week after next we'll I'll schedule all
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
the early bills there's a couple of uh I
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
think two or three pension bills and
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
some controversial licensing bills so
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
next week we'll be tougher that the week
 
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.269 align:start position:0%
next week we'll be tougher that the week
after

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
next sorry what else yes you represent a
 
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
B has the flag we saw it last year it's
 
00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that they've got a mirror
 
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:23.799 align:start position:0%
perfect yes I just wanted to um remind
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
the committee that early bill means that
 
00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:29.519 align:start position:0%
the bill will be heard by two committees
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
typically the initial
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
committee is the has to have it which in
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
many cases well not in many cases but
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
every every policy committee is going to
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
have early bills and in our case many of
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
the early bills that we have will go to
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
finance after but some of some of them
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
go to a separate committee maybe HHS or
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
um Commerce me ways and means so you
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
know if we so all committees who have
 
00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
bills that are going to be heard by two
 
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
committees have to go through their
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
bills by the certain date and those
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
dates are on a calendar if you start
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
reading the the calendar and look at
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
that section where they have the dates
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
those dates start to make more sense the
 
00:29:13.389 --> 00:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
more you get involved with committee
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
work no and we will be getting some
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
second committee bills if there's a bill
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
from another policy committee that deals
 
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
with Ru making or licensing we'll get it
 
00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:27.559 align:start position:0%
as a second committee to look at that
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
that issue
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
um not as many as we used to but
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
some yeah the deadline for early bills
 
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
as I said is March 6 so we'll be trying
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
to get those out
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh a my policy has always been to get to
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
vote out as many bills as we can so um
 
00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:54.919 align:start position:0%
except for tomorrow where I forgot when
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
we're in hearings if there's a bill that
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
we hear and everybody in the committee
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
looks at each other and say well that's
 
00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.630 align:start position:0%
looks at each other and say well that's
a

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:30:06.509 --> 00:30:06.519 align:start position:0%
loser we can immediately vote to get rid
 
00:30:10.029 --> 00:30:10.039 align:start position:0%
of it or contrarywise we say well duh we
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
should have done that years ago the same
 
00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559 align:start position:0%
thing so I will hope to get a lot of the
 
00:30:15.559 --> 00:30:16.549 align:start position:0%
thing so I will hope to get a lot of the
easy

00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
easy
 
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
bills quickly out of our possession the
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
harder ones go to
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um and the subcommittee
 
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
chairs can
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
schedule as many meetings as they want
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
when they want uh some subcommittees
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
like to eat meet first thing in the
 
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
morning because I won't start the
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
committee before
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
10 and other subcommittees like to meet
 
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:43.519 align:start position:0%
afterwards or on other days of the week
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's up to the the
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to figure out what works
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
for them and how many meetings they need
 
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.029 align:start position:0%
for them and how many meetings they need
to

00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:50.039 --> 00:30:51.750 align:start position:0%
to
have

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
generally the bills sponsors and
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes the agency or their Lobby of
 
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
the supporters will work with the
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to make sure that we meet
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
um most of the time a subcommittee will
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
recommend ought to pass with Amendment
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
and I've had to apologize to the house
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
at least twice for reporting a bill as
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with amendment when we
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
actually didn't amend it because I was
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
so unused to the idea of not having an
 
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:33.750 align:start position:0%
so unused to the idea of not having an
amendment

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
I do want to add that subcommittee
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
meetings are public hearings so that the
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
chairs of those subcommittees will
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
notice those meetings um so you'll get
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
they'll be in the calendar but you'll
 
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
also get the notification from
 
00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
our uh Robin Robin what's her she's a
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
commit the only difference is that
 
00:31:58.509 --> 00:31:58.519 align:start position:0%
subcommittees only need 24hour notice
 
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
so that it's perfectly possible at after
 
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
the hearing the subcommittee chair will
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
think how about we meet tomorrow at 9:00
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
and that's or actually at 3 o'clock and
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's good
 
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
enough um but they will be posted they
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
are public you will have people here
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so you have to be here yeah
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
yeah representative sellers thank you is
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
will you be having any uh executive
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
session on the same day of as
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
hearings yes like I said I expect to do
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
the obvious ones right away and there
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
some and there are others where it looks
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
obvious going in and then
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
the some of the testimony makes you say
 
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:50.919 align:start position:0%
oh my God we never thought about that
 
00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
and we we send it to subcommittee uh it
 
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
it depends on the
 
00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:58.519 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh
 
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
and I will confess that I forgot to
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
announce executive session for the bills
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
we will be hearing tomorrow afternoon so
 
00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:08.519 align:start position:0%
some of those might be taken up next
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
week if we have
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
time there's at least one that I think
 
00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:16.039 align:start position:0%
we will decide we'll agree we want to
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
pass it immediately but I've been wrong
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
before but I am scheduling
 
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
a an executive session for for our um in
 
00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:32.430 align:start position:0%
a an executive session for for our um in
3

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
3
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
weeks toward the end of the month and
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
that will be bills that uh weren't quite
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
so obvious but we've worked through and
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
that one will or they've gone to
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and the subcommittee was
 
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.750 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and the subcommittee was
easy

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
easy
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
that I'm trying to think of all the in
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
the things that might happen and there
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
could be that if we decide to exec a
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
bill and some of the committee members
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
are unsure about their position on the
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
bill it's possible for someone to ask um
 
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
for a caucus so that the Democrats and
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
the Republicans can e caucus before the
 
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
executive session it's highly unlikely
 
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
that we do that on bills that we decide
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
to exec the time because as chair
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
Maguire had says it's typically bills
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
that are um obvious when we hear the
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
bill and we can tell by the tenor in the
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
committee and the questions that people
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
are on the same
 
00:34:35.079 --> 00:34:37.149 align:start position:0%
are on the same
page

00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and speaking of that if I
 
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
please subcommittee chairs do not
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
schedule a uh the caucus is the
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
executive session I think is starting at
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
11: please do not schedule a
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittee at 10: because we want a
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
caucus we will we'll have a first caucus
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
so people can get used to the idea
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
something yeah uh Edna is fortunate that
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
we don't get a whole lot of partisan
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
issues but there's always a few and
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
there's some that that come out of
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
nowhere and you realize that without
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
planning all the Republicans are on one
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
side and the Democrats are on the other
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
side my uh first term that
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
happened because we had a second
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
committee bill that dealt with
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
providing Energy Information to home
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
buyers which was perfectly fine except
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
that it wanted
 
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
to have the real estate
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
inspectors prepare data on it and
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
provide the information and we the
 
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
Republicans all said well
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
you the home inspectors aren't
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for that kind of information
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
why should their license fees go toward
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
this other task
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
and so we ended up with a purely
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
partisan issue on a very straightforward
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
bill that we disagreed on how it should
 
00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.950 align:start position:0%
bill that we disagreed on how it should
be

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
implemented first time I spoke on the
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
floor that's why I remember it so well
 
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
all right any other uh questions
 
00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.030 align:start position:0%
all right any other uh questions
comments

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
no repr say so for those of us who are
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
just getting used to the calendar should
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
we plan on being here Wednesdays and
 
00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:32.599 align:start position:0%
Thursdays for the remainder of this
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
month uh yes thank you yes after after
 
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.349 align:start position:0%
month uh yes thank you yes after after
January

00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
January
 
00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:45.079 align:start position:0%
um we probably will will back off quite
 
00:36:45.079 --> 00:36:46.109 align:start position:0%
um we probably will will back off quite
a

00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:36:46.119 --> 00:36:48.589 align:start position:0%
a
bit

00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
um but the really tough bills will still
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
be in subcommittee so that that will be
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
the main effort is working through the
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
mention all right well I don't want to
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
talk anymore repr L on yes um yes did
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
you speak about the copies of the bills
 
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
and how we'll get those and that process
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
in order to have a hard copy as well
 
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
well as the electronic and how to access
 
00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
the electronics all right our first for
 
00:37:35.309 --> 00:37:35.319 align:start position:0%
hard copies we have a committee
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
assistant Robin Bach who sits outside of
 
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
Commerce 301 she will be providing us
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
hard copies of all the bills assigned to
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
the committee at the moment they aren't
 
00:37:52.589 --> 00:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
all done ah this is Representative Steve
 
00:37:52.599 --> 00:37:57.550 align:start position:0%
all done ah this is Representative Steve
Pearson

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:58.670 align:start position:0%
 
sen

00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
sen
 
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
here yes the building double booking yep
 
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
and um so anyway we will get hard copies
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
of all of the bills assigned some of
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
them will be later than others but
 
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
expect to have them the ones that we're
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with at the time of the hearing
 
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
if not sooner you'll you will be getting
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
a set of them uh there are drawers in
 
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
the committee room that are
 
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
um one one of them will be assigned to
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
you the labels aren't up yet so uh sorry
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
about that we will have to take care of
 
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
it and that you can keep whatever you
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
want in
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
and yes and I always schedule plan to
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
take a lunch break because I need one
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
and I assume many of you will as well uh
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
so we'll you'll have time to to at least
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
get up and stretch and go for a walk and
 
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
um yes represent Pearson if you want to
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%

will I am uh not afraid to hold my
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
tongue I will assert positions that I
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
think are
 
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
important um I have served on this
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
committee before I did two terms here
 
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
uh and I despite you know a little bit
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
of the heavy workload that we do here I
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
do very much enjoy uh what we do here at
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
Edna I'm happy to see representative
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
scitech back certainly and after after
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
his Hiatus as well and uh I think that
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll have a good two years here
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
and we'll accomplish some great things
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
00:40:38.079 --> 00:40:40.470 align:start position:0%
for the state
so

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
um I am certainly open to suggestions
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly open to questions uh I'll
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
talk with anybody about anything so
 
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
beyond that um please try to refrain
 
00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
from having a medical emergency take
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
your meds please uh I'm tired of dealing
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
with that in this building
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
but well actually it it looks I mean
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
there some years we had four or five
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
paramedics on the committee we have yeah
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
so this year it's all I think you're the
 
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
only one that that's fine that's fine
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
believe me I uh no problem there it's
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's been on the other hand the
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee looks younger and healthier
 
00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
than in many other years so yeah yeah
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
we're doing yeah we got a good yeah we

committees have a problem with that they
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%

couples serving on Edna which was
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
situation all right nobody else has
 
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
anything questions
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
comments she's represent Howard yeah uh
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to let everybody know
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh we have online uh remote testimony
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
missions uh that I'm going to just read
 
00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
out numbers uh whenever we have hearings
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh just so that people are aware thank
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for that I that
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
came in Fairly recently and so I was
 
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:09.640 align:start position:0%
mostly ignoring it but that's not the
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
right thing to do so thank you very much
 
00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
for your service that that will be
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
helpful represent Pearson I just have a
 
00:43:18.549 --> 00:43:18.559 align:start position:0%
question on the online stuff do we have
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
origin of uh online testimony as far as
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
CU during the co era uh with several of
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
us that have served during the co era um
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things that got a little
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
tiresome for me was listening to the
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
opinion of people in Oregon and Utah and
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
Wyoming because they had the ability to
 
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
just pipe on um the internet and
 
00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
and interject themselves into a New
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire process that is really
 
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
designed for New Hampshire citizens so
 
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
yeah there there you uh are required to
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
enter which town and state you live in
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's great because I
 
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
because I the weight of that certainly
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
matters to me so yeah well fortunately
 
00:44:02.549 --> 00:44:02.559 align:start position:0%
we're not doing hybrid Zoom meetings so
 
00:44:04.349 --> 00:44:04.359 align:start position:0%
they can still
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
submit testimony through the portal or
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
in writing to us in any way they like
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
and but it's only the people who come
 
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
and actually talk to us that we'll be
 
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
able will'll be excuse me able to
 
00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
interact with yeah I just wanted to
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
clarify I'm only reading out the number
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh not every single person and in the
 
00:44:27.069 --> 00:44:27.079 align:start position:0%
general text that they submit along
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
inside that uh testimony yeah because of
 
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
nothing else the um the online testimony
 
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
is probably like the email you'll find
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
out that on any Hot Topic where hot is
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
in the eye of the beholder you will get
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of form emails which are
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
identical and my policy is unless
 
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
they're from my town I'm going to ignore
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
it um read one and then toss the rest if
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
you actually get a a personal
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
testimony that's you know they're
 
00:45:02.349 --> 00:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
thinking about it that's worth a lot
 
00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:05.079 align:start position:0%
more than just checking off a box and
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
sending a form email as I'm sure you
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
will all find out when we get to some of
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
the Hot
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
Topics represents schmi I mean you're
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to see very frequently it's
 
00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh 50 or 100 emails that are identical
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
so they they just all their only
 
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
contribution is if they sign it all is
 
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
it a different name but it's the same
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
email over and over and over again so
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's obviously an organized effort to
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
influence us and I think it doesn't work
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
in my epic yeah speaking of that I hope
 
00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
you all have a uh an email box for
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
public use that was that you can handle
 
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
receiving large quantities of emails
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
because you will be getting them and you
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to lose something from your
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
brother-in-law saying we're we're coming
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
over on Sunday or whatever in the midst
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
of that nor do you want the email that
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
your spouse sent you up subject to a 91a
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
request as well precisely you want to
 
00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
keep it for for public
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
things anybody
 
00:46:15.549 --> 00:46:15.559 align:start position:0%
else may maybe you've noticed
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson the chair and I
 
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
are all speaking quite closely into the
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
microphone um because uh you will see
 
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
some of the Witnesses are a foot away
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
they might as well be speaking into
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
their hand uh because the microphones
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
are sensitive but not to a voice from a
 
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
foot away so you can speak calmly and
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
with without any great volume if you
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
have the microphone very close and and
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
another thing is you'll notice that most
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
of us are turning the microphone off
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
when we're done because if multiple
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
microphones are on the level of fidelity
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
to the voice goes way down so you really
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
need the chair will keep hers on because
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
she's running the meeting but uh it's
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
good idea to turn it off when you're not
 
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:09.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
okay so I have a question about how what
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
your discretion will be regarding um the
 
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
public reading their
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
testimony if it's really a member of the
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
public they they can do it if it's a
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
lobbyist or a professional I prefer that
 
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
they just give us the highlights because
 
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
if you've seen a bit of testimony you
 
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
know that somebody reading their
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
testimony is much less persuasive than
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
somebody using their testimony to to
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
give remind them of the highlights and
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
actually talking to us and I hope and I
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want I would encourage
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
people not to read their
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that's I'm not going to gabble
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
down of an actual citizen
 
00:47:59.790 --> 00:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
any yes represents CCH if I may about
 
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
reading I encourage them to I would
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
encourage them to read it because you
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
know it's going to be over somebody
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
speaking extemporaneously will just go
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
on and oh my God and Abraham began ISAC
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
and no no no I just representative zitec
 
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
has a lot of experience particularly
 
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
since he's been clerk many times and
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh that's a Viewpoint I hadn't
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
considered or delay on you have
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
something uh yes for the members of the
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
public it's just a matter of what makes
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
you more comfortable if you're reading
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
through and you can be concise that way
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
that's wonderful if that stresses you
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
out just speak with
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
us so all right and I will do do my best
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure all of our new members get
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
to get an amendment to write a committee
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
report and speak on the floor because
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's something that's it's not that
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
horrible please you don't have to start
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
out with a with a speech on a major
 
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
issue we have the advantage that most of
 
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:10.839 align:start position:0%
our our bills are inside baseball
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
they're small they're about things
 
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
people don't know about you can actually
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
change people's minds with a speech if
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a licensing is or a
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
rul making issue God forbid nobody comes
 
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
in with preconceptions about rule making
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
if you want to speak on a gun control
 
00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.390 align:start position:0%
if you want to speak on a gun control
Bill

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
say you're speaking to posterity in the
 
00:49:39.549 --> 00:49:39.559 align:start position:0%
in the journal because everybody knows
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
what they think about gun control Bills
 
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
going into the into the
 
00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.309 align:start position:0%
going into the into the
session

00:49:45.309 --> 00:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:49:45.319 --> 00:49:47.190 align:start position:0%
session
um

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
so we we we'll invite everybody to make
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
a to write a committee report and if
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
necessary speak on the floor about some
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
minor issue they care about you don't
 
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
anymore our clerk Mr Smith
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
is thinks blurbs are is an undignified
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
term fine as oldtimers still call them
 
00:50:14.789 --> 00:50:14.799 align:start position:0%
that so if I ask you for your blurbs
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
that's what I mean it's the committee
 
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
report and uh speaking of that I take
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
them written or email to me and uh I
 
00:50:24.839 --> 00:50:25.630 align:start position:0%
them written or email to me and uh I
have

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
a because of my experience working on a
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
newspaper I frequently edit them for uh
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
grammar coherence and so forth so I'll I
 
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
will gen I will
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
normally send them back to you for
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
so in that case I think we're about done
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
everybody gets a chance to stretch their
 
00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
legs for 10 minutes since it's been
 
00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
noticed we can't start early
 
00:50:59.069 --> 00:50:59.079 align:start position:0%
that's yeah yes sorry the the rule is
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
you can you can start late you can't
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:25.559 --> 00:51:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:25.510 align:start position:0%

yourself good morning uh my name is
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
Douglas ster how I am the director of
 
01:07:16.269 --> 01:07:16.279 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules unit for the
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services and with
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
me is one of the committee attorneys
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
Rebecca Ricard if you've ever attended a
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
Jael car you probably recognize Rebecca
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
um until recently I was on the wrong
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
side of things I was at this table
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
during Jael car but I sit over there
 
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
where representative Davis is now um so
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative Maguire asked us to
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
put on this presentation we're going to
 
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
keep it relatively short it should be
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
about an hour with time for questions uh
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to do kind of a high level
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
overview just sort of the relationship
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
between legislation and rules and sort
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
of what that means um it's nice to see
 
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
some of you again uh representative
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
Pearson you were on Edna when I first
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
started coming here every single day
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
over the last few years a lot of new
 
01:08:08.269 --> 01:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
faces as well so uh we'll get started
 
01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
this is us the office of legislative
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
Services we did hand out paper copies
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
and representative scitec I sent you an
 
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
email there's an electronic version and
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
I half apologize to attorney rard that
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh I didn't have
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
time it's the same exact doc so there is
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
an electronic version coming to you as
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
well so I thought we could start right
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
at the very beginning um the
 
01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
constitution of the State of New
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh small potatoes so the
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of different
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
administrative procedure act models out
 
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
there there's one from the 50s there's
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
one from the 80s and there's one from
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
1992 I believe New Hampshire's model
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
after the 1980 APA and that uh so what
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see is there's a very nice
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
opinion of the justices that came out in
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
1981 that I referenced quite a bit in
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
the beginning here and they you know the
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately legislature has the supreme
 
01:09:09.309 --> 01:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
power to draft
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
legislation The Authority lies with them
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
um but they do also have the ability to
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
delegate that authority to the executive
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
branch and so I'm just citing throughout
 
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
here you can go uh the executive branch
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
has no no inherent rule making Authority
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
so when you're like a commissioner of an
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
agency it is your job to make sure that
 
01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:33.799 align:start position:0%
agency runs dayto day but they don't
 
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
have any inherent Authority in the
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
agency to Draft rules or promulgate
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
rules of any kind um the legis ler may
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
not delegate unlimited Ru making
 
01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
authority to an agency so you can't
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
completely turn over the Reigns U not
 
01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
that I've seen that happen or from what
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
I've gathered nobody really wants to see
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
that happen uh which is a good thing
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
some checks and balances and then an
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
agency's authority allows it to sort of
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
fill in the details to effectuate the
 
01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of the statute and I'll get into
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
some examples later on too as to what
 
01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.229 align:start position:0%
some examples later on too as to what
that

01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:11.149 --> 01:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
means uh I'll leave time for questions
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
at the end but also if you have any
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
questions feel free to stop me a lot of
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
people in this room know I contend to
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
ramble uh so we talk about the
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
delegation of power I've already
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned the APA but in agency is
 
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
541a um
 
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
APA as I'm going to actually read this
 
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
definition each state board commission
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
Department institution officer or any
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
other state official or group other than
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature or the courts authorized
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
by law to make rules or to determine
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
contested cases now that seems like a
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
very simple thing and maybe too simple
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
for this but I have had to come before
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature on more than one
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
occasion and argue that definition of
 
01:10:59.790 --> 01:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
agency to a committee never house Edna
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
thankfully uh but but other committees
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
um but what an agency can look like
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
varies very very greatly so I put a
 
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
couple of examples on here on one end
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
you've got Department of Health and
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
Human Services which has multiple
 
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
locations thousands and thousands of
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
employees The Authority is granted to
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
the department but individual programs
 
01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
and are going to be promulgating the
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
rules and drafting those rules now the
 
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner has to have eyes on they
 
01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
have to sign off on that but it's it's a
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
very different structure than other
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
agencies uh a good example is office of
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
professional licenser and
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
certification uh so everyone knows prior
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
to this position I was General Counsel
 
01:11:43.149 --> 01:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
for the oplc and prior to that I was in
 
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of General Council for Health
 
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
and Human Services so I've been in a
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
couple of state agencies oplc is an
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
interesting one it's a much smaller
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
agency and then you're going to see
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
different typ types of organiz organized
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
just organized differently over there so
 
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to have uh for example the
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine which is its own state
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
agency that works sort of hand inhand
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
with the oplc and you're going to see
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
advisory boards such as recreational
 
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
therapists who are even though they're a
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
professional board it's the office that
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
has final rul making Authority for that
 
01:12:20.189 --> 01:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
board so even though it's two boards
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
within the same agency the structure is
 
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
going to be very different depending on
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
who you're talking about and then
 
01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
there's uh the office of the right to
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
know on budsman a personal favorite of
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
mine that is an agency of one it is Tom
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
Kerr he is the only employee of that
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
agency he sits in the basement of the
 
01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
annex he's a delightful individual if
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
you ever get a chance to meet him uh so
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see on one end you've got HHS
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
with thousands of employees and then
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
you've got the right to know on budsman
 
01:12:51.629 --> 01:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh so I also want to go over real quick
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
what a rule is because this is very very
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
important so a rule is any regulation
 
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
standard it's a statement of General
 
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
applicability uh meant to implement
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
interpret or make specific a statute
 
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
that prescribes or interprets agency
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
policy or practice and I bolded this
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
piece because it's key binding on
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
Persons outside of the agencies
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
including other
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
agencies so so internal practices and
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
procedures right we have this column
 
01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
over here what a rule is not so internal
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
agency me memoranda or policy only
 
01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
applicable to employees so if you're
 
01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:38.679 align:start position:0%
looking at a license the the
 
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
requirements for the license might be in
 
01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
rule how that license is processed when
 
01:13:46.629 --> 01:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
it comes into the agency might be a
 
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
policy or in a procedural manner for the
 
01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
agency not necessarily a rule though it
 
01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.430 align:start position:0%
agency not necessarily a rule though it
could

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
be uh information pamphlets letters are
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
explanatory material you'll see a lot of
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
this at HHS uh just explaining their
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
programs uh personal Personnel records
 
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
relating to hiring dismissal promotion
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
compensation investigations discipline
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
that is not rules although There are
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
rules that govern sort of how the state
 
01:14:15.629 --> 01:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
treats its own employees those are the
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
Personnel rules and then if it gets to
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
this point the Personnel appeals board
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
his sort of administrative rules for
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
hearings about employees and then
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
declaratory rulings uh you're not going
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
to have to deal with those too much in
 
01:14:33.149 --> 01:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch at least as far
 
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
as um statutes and that's basically when
 
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
somebody's confused about how a board or
 
01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
an agency would apply rules they can
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
present the facts to the agency and said
 
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
if this was a case before
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
you how what what would the outcome be
 
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
they're not binding and they're very
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
specific to the individual and the facts
 
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
before them it's not really a big part
 
01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
of rules right now uh so it is Cle I
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
just want to keep that binding on
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
Persons outside the agency including
 
01:15:02.239 --> 01:15:03.830 align:start position:0%
Persons outside the agency including
other

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
agencies so why is this important
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
because rules once properly adopted
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
carry the force of law now if they ever
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
conflict with a statute the statute is
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
going to Trump we'll get into that more
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit later but rules do carry
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
the force of Law and they are binding on
 
01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
the citizens and the agencies uh oh look
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
at that that's what I was going to say
 
01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
one comment I want to put in is that
 
01:15:31.709 --> 01:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
normal rules expire in 10
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
years and an expired rule cannot be
 
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
enforced and that is a policy that we
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
put in some years back but it's very
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
important because there are some
 
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
activities that are only defined in Rule
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
and there are also things like fees that
 
01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
are defined only in rule the the law may
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
say you may have fees on about this but
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
the specific if the specific amount of
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
the fee is set in the rule it can't be
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
collected if the rule has expired
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
and we and jail car have been beating up
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
a number of agencies about enforcing
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
expired rules and I personally intend to
 
01:16:14.159 --> 01:16:15.470 align:start position:0%
expired rules and I personally intend to
do

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
so absolutely so when I say a rule is is
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
binding on an agency I do mean any rule
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
that is only properly adopted through
 
01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
the system and still still in effect so
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
as representative Maguire explains rules
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
dates so there are also I earlier I
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there the the legislature
 
01:16:41.629 --> 01:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
cannot delegate all of its rule making
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
authority to the executive branch but
 
01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
there are other limitations on rule
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
making Authority both on the legislature
 
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
but also on the executive branch so uh
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
this one is applies to an agency an
 
01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
agency may not delegate its rule making
 
01:16:58.629 --> 01:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
authority to anyone other than the
 
01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
agency named in the statute delegating
 
01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:05.560 align:start position:0%
Authority so I can't if
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I think oplc is a good example so if
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
you have the office and you have the
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
we'll use the Board of Medicine again
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
they both have different roles and
 
01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities the Board of Medicine
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
could not turn over that authority to
 
01:17:21.629 --> 01:17:21.639 align:start position:0%
the office because it's easier or more
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
convenient or faster for them they have
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
the obligation and they have to do that
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
rule making um the other an agency may
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
not adopt rules other under another
 
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
agency's Authority and that can come
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
into play when you see transfers so I'm
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
going to keep jumping back to HHS
 
01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
and oplc quite a bit because I'm very
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
familiar with both agencies but for
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
example the Board of Nursing used to be
 
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
housed under Health and Human Services
 
01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
they're now uh housed under the oplc so
 
01:17:53.629 --> 01:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
if there was any roles and
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that would have been
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
the agencies being HHS those would now
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
have to fall under oplc and that's going
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
to require a statutory change uh one of
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
the things um Edna has been working on
 
01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
and you're going to see a little bit of
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
it this year is um just sort of clean up
 
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
statuto language to address those kind
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
of things uh nothing like the last two
 
01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:17.709 align:start position:0%
of things uh nothing like the last two
years

01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
though uh other rule Mak limitations on
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority even when there is
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
General delegation of Authority there
 
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
are certain requirements and rules that
 
01:18:32.669 --> 01:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
need specific statutory authorization so
 
01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
a good example of General delegation
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
Authority uh would be such organ
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
organizational and procedural rules
 
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
necessary for the implementation of the
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
statute or for the office that type of
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
language but even with that language in
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
place without specific language in the
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
statute an agency cannot promulgate
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
rules around penalties or fines license
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
or licensing and that includes layers of
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
licenses within licenses uh fees
 
01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.590 align:start position:0%
licenses within licenses uh fees
non-consensual

01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
non-consensual
 
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
inspections uh the expansion or
 
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
limitation of the scope of who may
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
practice a profession or submission of
 
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
social security numbers and you will
 
01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes see in statutes when it comes
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
to uh limitation on scope of who may
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
practice a profession the statute will
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
also will sometimes explicitly say you
 
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
have have no rul making authority to do
 
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
that it's just so that it's very clear
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
um not entirely entirely necessary
 
01:19:34.629 --> 01:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
because if it's not explicit The
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
Authority doesn't exist but I think it's
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's very helpful for people on the
 
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
other end you may jump in and just
 
01:19:44.629 --> 01:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
another example with regard to the fees
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
so if the legislature wants to set a
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
specific fee for something for example
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
for a license you need to put that
 
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
directly in your statute if you want the
 
01:19:58.750 --> 01:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
agency to set the fee say you know they
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
need to make a certain amount of money
 
01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:01.719 align:start position:0%
in order to operate like a lot of the
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
boards at the oplc then you can give
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
that agency the discretion to make the
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
fee so that's something you think about
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
when you're making legislation do you
 
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
want to set a fee and have that fee be
 
01:20:15.629 --> 01:20:15.639 align:start position:0%
the fee or are you going to give that
 
01:20:21.070 --> 01:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
agency yeah within within limits of
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
course if you say that to a fine no more
 
01:20:26.159 --> 01:20:27.709 align:start position:0%
course if you say that to a fine no more
than

01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
,000 most agencies will consider that to
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
be a floor of
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
$1,000 so you'll you'll expect just to
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
narrow down that fee pretty precisely
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
and the other is that it's a good idea
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
to put uh limitations on what how much
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
the fees can be even if you're giving
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
them the authority so that you would say
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
to collect the fees to fund the
 
01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.870 align:start position:0%
to collect the fees to fund the
operation

01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
operation
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
plus no more than 25%
 
01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
extra uh that's because you're
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
estimating the the for the
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
future you you can't do it exactly so
 
01:21:09.149 --> 01:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
you you want to aim to have the fee
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
cover it plus a little bit um this ver
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
BR I just wanted to make a comment to
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
the committee that one of the reasons
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
why this is important is it's often
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
times people we submit bills and after
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
their past we're like phew glad that's
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
over but really there's a whole
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
component afterwards which is the ru
 
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
making component that lately hasn't been
 
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
as um the details to that attention
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
hasn't been paid so I think that's why
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
this is particularly important to our
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
committee because we do see um bills
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
that come to State agencies will talk
 
01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
about the ru making of the agency and I
 
01:21:50.669 --> 01:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
think it's something that we should sus
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
out when we hear the bills and that
 
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
that's something that if you choose to
 
01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
serve on a different committee we hope
 
01:21:59.950 --> 01:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
that you'll take with you and you will
 
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
look at the ru making Authority on other
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
bills and say okay yeah that this is too
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
broad like we had um just before
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
Christmas we had a bill about not a bill
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
a rule for approval about
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
landfills and I went and looked at the
 
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
authority the agency had to
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
design this the technical scope of the
 
01:22:26.189 --> 01:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
landfill and there there were no
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
technical criteria whatsoever none zero
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
so they they could they could make up a
 
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
number it it said you have to consider
 
01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
you know the environment around and but
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
how closely around in what matter no no
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
details they figured it out and we've
 
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
gotten a lot of I've I've lost a lot of
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
fights on the house floor saying we're
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
giving them too much Authority we have
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
to make a decision about
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
this but other people didn't want to
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
belly up and say no we we know what this
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
number should be or what the scope of
 
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
this issue is and we want the DS to or
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
HHS or whomever to take care of
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
it yes representative
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you uh Madam chair uh so
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
in in line with what you have just been
 
01:23:23.310 --> 01:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
talking about one of the things that you
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
have been very instrumental LA and in
 
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
your time in the legislature in this
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
committee is uh addressing the issue
 
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
that uh that your language I think was
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
very not only appropriate but but kind
 
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
of illustrative of the concept that that
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
you've just been speaking about that
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
so-called barnor situation where the the
 
01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
statute says the commissioner shall
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
write rules that's it which meant that
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh and and that that we had a lot of
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
rules like that where the commissioner
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
had blanket Authority and uh and agency
 
01:24:10.510 --> 01:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
really in many cases does not like that
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
because it exposes them entirely
 
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
whatever the commissioner comes up with
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh is now the is now the law and uh
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
because rules is you've been saying Doug
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh has a force of law um and now the
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner has created a whole
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
structure based on that blanket
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
Authority well uh it's an invitation to
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
overreach and so we've been un undoing a
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
lot of situations where it's not that
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
blanket because if it is that way we're
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
stuck with that uh but to get the rule
 
01:24:49.109 --> 01:24:49.119 align:start position:0%
making much more specific along in the
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
lines of what you've been talking about
 
01:24:53.709 --> 01:24:53.719 align:start position:0%
so that they do not have blanket
 
01:24:53.719 --> 01:24:54.870 align:start position:0%
so that they do not have blanket
Authority

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
um and no barn doors but uh it's
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
important for the committee to
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
understand that as well thank you that
 
01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
was one of the accomplishments of the
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
20112 legislature representative Schmidt
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
and I put in the requirements for a lot
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
of cases of broad rulemaking Authority
 
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
including the entire State Medicaid
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
Program which had been under the
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
hhs's blanket authority to implement the
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
pur purpose of this chapter but we we
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
the two of us and with a help from other
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
committee members wrote the requirements
 
01:25:32.639 --> 01:25:33.629 align:start position:0%
committee members wrote the requirements
for

01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:33.639 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:25:37.229 --> 01:25:37.239 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program what the agency had
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
the authority to do and I'm actually
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
very proud of that
 
01:25:45.109 --> 01:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
accomplishment all right thank you for
 
01:25:45.119 --> 01:25:46.669 align:start position:0%
accomplishment all right thank you for
the

01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
interruption well I think this were some
 
01:25:50.189 --> 01:25:50.199 align:start position:0%
very excellent points and I think it's
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
also good to point out as you've done
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire that even when
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
you give the agencies Authority it's not
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
all or nothing you can set parameters
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
around that and then also that list on
 
01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
the previous page there if you intend an
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
agency to say be able to collect fees or
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
a social security number because of an
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
application you might have to put that
 
01:26:13.149 --> 01:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
in there and so so that sort of General
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
language might not get the job done
 
01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:19.590 align:start position:0%
language might not get the job done
excuse

01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:25.149 --> 01:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
me um and in in addition to the
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
limitations that are in statute there's
 
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
also limitations on rule making
 
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:30.280 align:start position:0%
Authority in the Jael car rules
 
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
themselves and just real quickly there's
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
um I I mentioned this before but
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority is needed to create
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
categories or level of a license or fee
 
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
system um though if there is Authority
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
for fees fees may be charged for
 
01:26:48.669 --> 01:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
different Services uh Authority needed
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
for subpoena power uh there's
 
01:26:54.030 --> 01:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
been talk about Department of Education
 
01:26:55.470 --> 01:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
and their subpoena power for the last
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
few years and that keeps coming up over
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
and over uh they would need the
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to issue a subpoena
 
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
um to require continuing education for
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
professional licenses however if a
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
committee gives a board we'll use Board
 
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
of Medicine again authority to set the
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
requirements for uh renewal of that
 
01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
license they can set education
 
01:27:20.830 --> 01:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
requirements as part of the renewal so
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of a splitting hairs
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
thing that you'd have to take a look at
 
01:27:26.669 --> 01:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
each and each and every time um
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
liability insurance for lies and then uh
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
it also it adds a little bit more to the
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
prohibition on collecting Social
 
01:27:36.189 --> 01:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
Security numbers and creates an
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
exemption for purposes of preventing
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
criminal acts such as fraud or to
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
identify tax or criminal
 
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
records and then I mentioned this
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
earlier but even though rules carry the
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
force of law they are not law and they
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
if they conflict with a statute the
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
statute is going to Trump the rule every
 
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
single time and then specific
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
authorization is required to incorporate
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
any reference by code rule or document
 
01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
from another state government uh a good
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
example of that is uh State Board of
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
Education and they have the ability to
 
01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
promate rules for recertification of
 
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
teachers but they can also do that based
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
on another State's procedures if or
 
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
other states professional development if
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's approved by the New Hampshire
 
01:28:22.109 --> 01:28:22.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so that would be
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
an example of specific statut language
 
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
allowing Department of Education to use
 
01:28:29.709 --> 01:28:29.719 align:start position:0%
another State's criteria if
 
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
approved um more limitations on Ru
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
making Authority this is a big one I
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
used the picture Boston party it's in a
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
mood administrative rules are subject to
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
the prohibition against unfunded State
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
mandates to political subdivisions and
 
01:28:47.229 --> 01:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
this is something that agencies have to
 
01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:49.400 align:start position:0%
attest to every single time they
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
promulgate a rule uh they are not
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to increase the costs for
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:01.390 --> 01:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
rule the uh the ex
 
01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
blanket exemption to that is if the
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
municipality has freely
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
adopted a program say a transfer station
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
or whatever then by that act and funding
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
it they are cons considered to consent
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
to minor minor changes to the
 
01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:25.990 align:start position:0%
to minor minor changes to the
requirements

01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
so that's the biggest loophole we've got
 
01:29:30.669 --> 01:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a there's a couple of cases
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
I think the most recent and maybe
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
impactful is that city of conquer case
 
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
and they to do talk about in that case
 
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:41.719 align:start position:0%
um sort of like if it's a new roll of
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility if it should be the rle
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
of responsibility of the municipality
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
and they gave it up to the state and are
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
not required to take it back um if
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
there's just a changing in funding so
 
01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that goes on that analysis
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
but that's a constitutional question uh
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
not going to get into it too much
 
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:03.400 align:start position:0%
today Pearson you've got a well yeah
 
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
there's another thing too with 28a in
 
01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
the S of in the sense of consent right
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
so if a if a if a political subdivision
 
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
agrees to do
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
something then the 28a
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
procedure is now different so that is
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
where uh there needs to be uh some
 
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
discretion when those that are willing
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
to consent to something um or enter into
 
01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
something at the state
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
level now have to understand that once
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
they've consented to be part of that
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that they've now can't
 
01:30:39.629 --> 01:30:39.639 align:start position:0%
turn around and go whoa whoa hold on 28a
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
28a well wait a minute you've consented
 
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
to be part of this and 28a is out the
 
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
window and we have multiple court cases
 
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
to affirm the fact that that is how
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
things go so so it's just a word of
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
caution for those that that jump into
 
01:30:55.870 --> 01:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
something that don't think about the
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
fact that you've surrendered some
 
01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:02.150 --> 01:31:04.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
28a and then
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes and then um on top of the
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
requirements prescribed by the
 
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
legislature for the agencies to adopt
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
there's also blanket Lang language that
 
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
requires agencies to adopt which you'll
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
typically see in rules the 100s the 200s
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
those chapters uh organizational rules
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
those are your 100s those contain your
 
01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:30.280 align:start position:0%
purpose statements those types of things
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
and rules for practice and procedure
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
tend to be in your 200s that's where
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to see
 
01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:39.310 align:start position:0%
you're going to see
your

01:31:39.310 --> 01:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
um disciplinary proceedings your
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceedings appeals you're
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
going to see the ru making process laid
 
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
out in in those 200s you're going to see
 
01:31:51.149 --> 01:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
waiver language for the rules in those
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
200s and uh important thing to point
 
01:31:56.189 --> 01:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
point out too is in the 100s and 200s do
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
not expire other rules expire after 10
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
years the 100s and 200s do not expire
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
unless something happens either to the
 
01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:06.440 align:start position:0%
agency or there's a change but they can
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
be in effect essentially in
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
perpetuity uh and then again waivers any
 
01:32:13.629 --> 01:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
agency May wave its own rule but they
 
01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
must have a procedure in place in rule
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
about how that is done and again those
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
are going to pop up in your 200s most of
 
01:32:24.109 --> 01:32:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
so then once uh a bill is passed it's
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor it goes into
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
effect and then it becomes the agency's
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility to actually promate the
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
rules and those procedures for the
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
adoptions of rules is governed by is uh
 
01:32:42.189 --> 01:32:42.199 align:start position:0%
RSA 541 A5 through A14 that's sort of
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
for regular Ru making and then there's
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
additional requirements there can be
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
emergency rules there can be interum
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
rules that are in play only for a short
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
time there are a lot of moving parts to
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
this but in general once the legislative
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
branch has given the authority to the
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
Executive Branch the executive branch
 
01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
now has the obligation to bring those
 
01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:01.590 align:start position:0%
now has the obligation to bring those
rules

01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
forward uh it's a very simple process
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
this so uh we're actually on Friday
 
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
going to be giving another presentation
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
specifically to the Jael car and that's
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
going to have a little bit more detail
 
01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:22.280 align:start position:0%
on on the the rule writing process
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
specifically I thought for today since
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
you're going to be creating the law is
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
giving that Authority that would be the
 
01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
focus uh it is a little bit of a
 
01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
complicated process there's a lot of
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
moving Parts there's actually six
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
different types of rule making that can
 
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
occur um each with their own sort of
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
different deadlines and standards and
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
requirements that have to be met um but
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
for your basic basic rule you can
 
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
simplify it down to essentially these
 
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
five steps and remember there's a
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
million moving Parts in each of these
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
steps but essentially an agency is going
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
to file um with OS that's us the initial
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
proposal of the rules they intend to
 
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
adopt and that includes a fiscal impact
 
01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
statement a fiscal impact statement is
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:34:11.790 --> 01:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
the impact of the rule would have on
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
costs either to other agencies or to
 
01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
lenes or whoever they might be in the
 
01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
public or or a change in rule or if the
 
01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
rule had been expired and they're going
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
to be um prolongated again a new you
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
could compare it to the old rule uh the
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
LBA does the fiscal impact statements
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
and they provide them to us uh agency is
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
required to hold a public hearing and
 
01:34:37.229 --> 01:34:37.239 align:start position:0%
they receive comment on public
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
testimony um then after that the agency
 
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
modifies the rules based on stakeholder
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
input that can look very different I
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
have had rules where I've had a 100
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
people show up and we've taken testimony
 
01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
for hours and hours at these public
 
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
hearings I've seen public testimony in
 
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
the hundreds where you've had to distill
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
it down down to 100 Pages where you
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
might have duplicative testimony and
 
01:34:58.629 --> 01:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
I've had public hearings where
 
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely nobody shows up and I wait
 
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
around for half an hour and then I put a
 
01:35:07.229 --> 01:35:07.239 align:start position:0%
note to the Jael car that nobody nobody
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
came um then after the agency has
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
modified the rules they submit a final
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
proposal uh they might need an
 
01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
additional fiscal impact statement if
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
there's significant change to the rules
 
01:35:21.310 --> 01:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
and then that final present uh proposal
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
is what is presented to the Jael car
 
01:35:25.950 --> 01:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
The Joint legislative committee on
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
administrative rules made up of both
 
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
members of the house and members of the
 
01:35:33.550 --> 01:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
Senate I'd like to comment that the when
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
they are preparing the initial proposal
 
01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
is the most that's the most useful time
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
to comment every week you will receive
 
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
an email notice of the rul making
 
01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
register which lists the pro proposals
 
01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
that are starting that are in the
 
01:35:55.629 --> 01:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
process at that stage stage and it tells
 
01:35:58.830 --> 01:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
you why they're doing the rule and the
 
01:36:02.669 --> 01:36:02.679 align:start position:0%
text of the rule and the why the rule
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
also includes how to comment and who to
 
01:36:07.629 --> 01:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
comment to when the public hearing is
 
01:36:09.149 --> 01:36:09.159 align:start position:0%
and what the period for written
 
01:36:09.159 --> 01:36:10.510 align:start position:0%
and what the period for written
testimony

01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:36:14.590 --> 01:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
is uh if you would open that up and look
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
at it there may be some rules you know
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
from your previous
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
life uh if you're a real estate agent
 
01:36:24.430 --> 01:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
saying you you've got rules on the from
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
the real estate board you would should
 
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
look at it if you've built a house you
 
01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
should look at things
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
about uh the plumbers board or
 
01:36:38.109 --> 01:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
whatever take a take a look at it or you
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
know if you are not an expert you may
 
01:36:44.109 --> 01:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
just send a general comment or what I
 
01:36:46.109 --> 01:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
found useful is send it to some friends
 
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
who really do know the
 
01:36:50.669 --> 01:36:50.679 align:start position:0%
subject I I've got a couple of
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
contractors I've dealt with and I send
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
them everything that might possibly deal
 
01:36:57.709 --> 01:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
with that and because they the the
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
trouble with most of the analysis of the
 
01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
rules is that we all aren't in the gut
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
in the dirt we don't understand the
 
01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
details something that looks perfectly
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
fine on
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
paper may get all the actual people
 
01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
involved in a screaming fury because
 
01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:16.430 align:start position:0%
involved in a screaming fury because
it's

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:18.679 align:start position:0%
outrageous and you won't know it unless
 
01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with it so spread that
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
to u to more people that you know and
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
ask them to comment and the written
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
written comment is ju is nearly as good
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
as going to the public hearing as Doug
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
said lots of times nobody shows up or
 
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's at An Inconvenient time but
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
they do pay attention to public comment
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
so please do okay I think that's an
 
01:37:46.109 --> 01:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
excellent point and the other thing an
 
01:37:47.950 --> 01:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
agency can do and I know I have done
 
01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
this in the past when I was with the
 
01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
executive branch is actually put out a
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
notice that says we are going to submit
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
an initial proposal and solicit that
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
feedback and see if you can get Buy in
 
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
before you ever even start with a formal
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
rul making process it can be very very
 
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
helpful especially especially when
 
01:38:11.310 --> 01:38:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
experts the other thing is when a an
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
initial proposal comes in that comes
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
along with a public notice and one thing
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
that OS Rebecca myself will do is we
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
will rev that notice to make sure it's
 
01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
sufficient but it has to identify the
 
01:38:30.510 --> 01:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
specific statutory Authority that gives
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
the agency rulle making Authority it has
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
to identify the specific statutes that
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
the rules are intended to implement
 
01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
because that might be different from the
 
01:38:42.589 --> 01:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority itself uh and it
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
has to give in enough it has to give
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
enough detail so that the public when
 
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
they saw that notice is going to know
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
what's going on when the agency is doing
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
new rulem and if it doesn't meet those
 
01:38:56.109 --> 01:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
requirements we will kick it back to the
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
agency and we will not put it in the
 
01:38:59.709 --> 01:38:59.719 align:start position:0%
register until they sort of get their
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:11.159 --> 01:39:12.950 align:start position:0%
 
gone

01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
gone
 
01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.669 align:start position:0%
gone
what

01:39:14.669 --> 01:39:14.679 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you uh I wanted to ask you
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
to weigh in a little bit one of the
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
issues that we have come across in this
 
01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:25.719 align:start position:0%
committee uh over the years is with
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
regard to pharmacies especially
 
01:39:30.589 --> 01:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
compounding pharmacies I don't think I
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
don't know whether we have one operating
 
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire right now I believe we
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
do but but but I'm not familiar with how
 
01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
many in in the specifics but anyway some
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
of us who've been around for a while or
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
members of the public who are paying
 
01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
attention probably remember the
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
situation down in Massachusetts about 10
 
01:39:52.709 --> 01:39:52.719 align:start position:0%
years ago with a um one of the
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
compounding pharmacies that was uh
 
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
guilty of pretty gross neglect of their
 
01:40:00.669 --> 01:40:00.679 align:start position:0%
requirements and so forth and they did
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
put some stuff together that I think
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
they killed a couple of people as a
 
01:40:06.109 --> 01:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
matter of fact with some of the stuff
 
01:40:08.830 --> 01:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
that came out uh and they got they got
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
shut down this was about 10 years ago
 
01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
but to the degree that we have
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
compounding pharmacies obviously they
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
have to be under the the purview of the
 
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
state government to inspect them on a
 
01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
regular basis and so forth make sure
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
that they're are not guilty of the the
 
01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
kind of uh incompetence or negligence
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
that they were doing at this in New
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
England I think it was called something
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
like that when that wound up harming the
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
public general public and uh so we
 
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
that's something that we all need to be
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
aware of with regard to com compounding
 
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacies but also generally so maybe
 
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:57.149 --> 01:40:57.159 align:start position:0%
well I don't I I don't know if I can
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
speak specifically to the compounding
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
but I do think it go it goes back to
 
01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:05.159 align:start position:0%
sort of the delegation of power there
 
01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
and then if you're going to give an
 
01:41:09.589 --> 01:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
agency the authority
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
to promate rules around compounding and
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
and Facilities that can do that uh you
 
01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
also need to it may be a good idea I
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
can't say need maybe a good idea to
 
01:41:21.149 --> 01:41:21.159 align:start position:0%
include some sort of inspection
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
requirements right there in the statue
 
01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
if you remember one of those uh
 
01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on rulle making without
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
explicit Authority is the ability of an
 
01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
agency to just go into a place so you do
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
need you do need specific statutory
 
01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
authority to inspect without um the
 
01:41:40.109 --> 01:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
other side's consent so that's an
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
excellent point well there's a modern
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
kind a relatively new kind of drug
 
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
that's out there called
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
biologics okay and there are three three
 
01:41:55.589 --> 01:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
ways that those can be administered the
 
01:41:58.109 --> 01:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
most expensive one uh and most
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
restrictive is at in the hospital itself
 
01:42:04.589 --> 01:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
and most of our hos big hospitals have a
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
have a compounding pharmacy section uh
 
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
in there on their premises but that is
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
expensive and uh uh so many hospitals
 
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
have a a secondary facility that has to
 
01:42:23.229 --> 01:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
be like 300 yards away or something like
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
like that otherwise they fall under the
 
01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
billing requirements of the hospital uh
 
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:31.719 align:start position:0%
so there you you possibly have a
 
01:42:36.189 --> 01:42:36.199 align:start position:0%
relative or or or a loved one that has
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh getting some kind of
 
01:42:41.589 --> 01:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
infusions and they typically will go to
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
a such a separate facility
 
01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid this is really
 
01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
fascinating but it's kind of straying
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
from the topic well but I'm I had to
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
give you a little bit of background and
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
the the Third Way is some people of
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
course are very immobile and can't get
 
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere and those people they going to
 
01:43:02.669 --> 01:43:02.679 align:start position:0%
have a nurse that comes to their
 
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
premises and sets up their sterile area
 
01:43:09.629 --> 01:43:09.639 align:start position:0%
and so forth so they are they require
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
special training to be able to do that
 
01:43:14.589 --> 01:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
and our this committee had a bill a
 
01:43:16.589 --> 01:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago where we had a
 
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee where we um so that's the
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
kind of thing that we I think we have to
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
be aware of if you have a relative
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
has that kind of need that that
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
capability exists but it's very
 
01:43:31.470 --> 01:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
carefully restricted to people with
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
special training so thank
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
you I think that's an excellent point
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
too and I think it goes back to really
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
the necessity of subject matter expence
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
right so we're here at OS we we have a
 
01:43:45.550 --> 01:43:45.560 align:start position:0%
bunch of Staff attorneys but if you put
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
a pharmacy rule in front of us we may be
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
able to tell you here's the statutory
 
01:43:53.589 --> 01:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
Authority here's the um stat is going to
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
implement but we might not have the
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical expertise so when you're
 
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
drafting that language you know speak to
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
your constituents your stakeholders get
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
that subject matter expertise both
 
01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
before and after rule making has begun
 
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
um but once the rule making is complete
 
01:44:10.030 --> 01:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
and that final proposal has been
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
submitted then it goes to Jael car for
 
01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
review and the Jael car's primary Duty
 
01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:16.709 align:start position:0%
review and the Jael car's primary Duty
excuse

01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
me is to review proposed and uh
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
previously adopted rules that's gel car
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
rule 102.3 all the stuff here today is
 
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
available on the Gen website and if uh
 
01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
that slide that said resources that was
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to be deleted it was too long
 
01:44:35.229 --> 01:44:35.239 align:start position:0%
we can reach out I have cards with me
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
today and I can help people find
 
01:44:39.550 --> 01:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
whatever they need um but pursuant to
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
541a the APA this is again a very
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
simplified version there's different
 
01:44:46.109 --> 01:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
versions of approvals there's different
 
01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
versions of objections but essentially
 
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
it comes down to the Jael car May
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
approve the rule and then an agency May
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
adopt um they may object to the rule an
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
agency may
 
01:44:59.790 --> 01:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
still adopt a rule over Jael car's
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
objection and you'll see it says
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
presumptive validity and no presumptive
 
01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
validity and the difference there is
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
that if the Jael car approves the rule
 
01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:09.080 align:start position:0%
and the agency adopts and the agency
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
gets sued the rule is presumed valid in
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
court if the jail car objects and the
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
agency adopts over that jail car the
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
burden switches and the agency now has
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that it is a valid rule
 
01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
they do not have that presumption
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
anymore and then the other thing the jel
 
01:45:27.149 --> 01:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
car can do and this will prevent an
 
01:45:29.629 --> 01:45:29.639 align:start position:0%
agency from adopting is to introduce a
 
01:45:33.629 --> 01:45:33.639 align:start position:0%
joint legislation essentially um a bill
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to change the statutes uh
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
and there's all sorts of timelines and
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
rules about when that has to happen
 
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
whether they're in session whether
 
01:45:42.189 --> 01:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
you're out of session those kind of
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
things but it's it's way too specific
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
and complicated for the purposes of
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
today uh we also haven't seen one of
 
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
those in a few years at this point yes
 
01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
but they that's
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
the point is that a committee cannot
 
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
take on the full function of the whole
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
legislature so gel car can approve and
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's assumed that everybody else in the
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
legislature who would have commented
 
01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
agrees with the the committee but to
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
stop the rule the jel car has to get the
 
01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
approval and agreement of the rest of
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
the legislature and I think I've seen
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
four of
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
them luckily I've never had that happen
 
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
to me me so um so the Jael car review
 
01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
and I I think representative Maguire you
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
just touched on this a little bit but
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
Jael car is not a policy committee and
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
so they're not really reviewing the rule
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
for whether they think it's good or it's
 
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
bad they're really reviewing the rule
 
01:46:39.229 --> 01:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
for whether it falls with in line with
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
the statute and if they have the
 
01:46:43.229 --> 01:46:43.239 align:start position:0%
authority and that's we have recently
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
seen rules where representative Lon made
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
a speech specifically about this um a
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
jail car or two ago um but the jail car
 
01:46:54.189 --> 01:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
does have ground to object to a rule if
 
01:46:56.109 --> 01:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
it's proposed one if it's beyond the
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
authority of the agency these are the
 
01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
types of things that OS staff are trying
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
to identify in flag for members of the
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
Jael car uh if it's contrary to the
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
intent of the legislature conflicts with
 
01:47:11.589 --> 01:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
statute that doesn't necessarily mean um
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
the statute is trying to implement uh we
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
just saw potentially in the dental rules
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
last Jael car where the language in the
 
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
proposed rule conflicted with the
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
statute not listed in noticed because it
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't trying to implement that statute
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
now that's not necessarily going to
 
01:47:30.589 --> 01:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
catch every time which is why subject
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
matter experts are so important um and
 
01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
we we had a lot of public testimony on
 
01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
that um if it's determined not to be in
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
the public interest that could be the
 
01:47:43.870 --> 01:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
agency didn't necessarily take into
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
account public testimony but it could
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
also be things like Clarity if it's if
 
01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
if it's ambiguous language or if if
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
there's an inability to apply the langu
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
language uniformally among the people it
 
01:47:57.550 --> 01:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
falls under uh if it's deemed by the
 
01:48:00.030 --> 01:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
committee to not have a or to have a
 
01:48:02.189 --> 01:48:02.199 align:start position:0%
substantial economic impact not
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
recognized in the fiscal impact
 
01:48:07.229 --> 01:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
statement that's again um a fiscal
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
impact caused by the rule and not
 
01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily the statute um and that's
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
where where if rules change between the
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
IP and FP stage we might require an
 
01:48:18.189 --> 01:48:18.199 align:start position:0%
agency to go back out and get another
 
01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact statement from the LBA and
 
01:48:22.350 --> 01:48:22.360 align:start position:0%
then for interm rules which is another
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
special kind of rule if the rule doesn't
 
01:48:26.189 --> 01:48:26.199 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements to implement the
 
01:48:30.189 --> 01:48:30.199 align:start position:0%
rule in term rules have I believe five
 
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
categories five Cate some number of
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
categories limited number of categories
 
01:48:38.189 --> 01:48:38.199 align:start position:0%
for which you can do um an interm rule
 
01:48:41.470 --> 01:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
one you might see is if the rule
 
01:48:44.430 --> 01:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
expired um rather to shorten the time
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
where an agency is without a rule they
 
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
might do an in uh interm rule or if
 
01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
there's a legislative change it's just a
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
quicker little temporary because an
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
interm rule only last 180 days not 10
 
01:48:57.070 --> 01:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
years so it's sort of a quick fix
 
01:48:59.589 --> 01:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid while you work on regular rul
 
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
making and then um after final action by
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
the Jael car be it um approval be it
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
objection the assuming there's no
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
blanking on the term joint resolution uh
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
the agency May adopt a rule the rules
 
01:49:20.350 --> 01:49:20.360 align:start position:0%
will go into effect at 12:01 the day
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
following the filing with the ol un uh
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
unless they specifically identify
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
another effective date in their adoption
 
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
letter most rules again are valid for 10
 
01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
years there are exceptions such as
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
emergency and interum rules and then
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
again it needs to be stressed uh adopted
 
01:49:39.669 --> 01:49:39.679 align:start position:0%
rules carry the weight of Law and are
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
binding on the persons they
 
01:49:44.669 --> 01:49:44.679 align:start position:0%
affect so there just a few things to
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
just think about we've kind of touched
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
upon a lot of them today when you're
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
drafting leg legislation things to keep
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
in mind is the language clear enough
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
that the agency will understand the
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
intent uh we talked about drafting
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
language with specificity but you can
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
also sort of finagle things so you can
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
have given agencies sort of General
 
01:50:08.669 --> 01:50:08.679 align:start position:0%
Powers but within a very narrow scope a
 
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
good example might be appeals you might
 
01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
say the agency can promulgate rules to
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
to do whatever they need to do to have
 
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
this appeal process work but so that's
 
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
very broad language but with a very
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
limited scope so when you're drafting
 
01:50:24.189 --> 01:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
legislation you know this as well as I
 
01:50:27.070 --> 01:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
do it's more more art than science but
 
01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
but you have to be careful is it is it
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
specific enough also to avoid unintended
 
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
consequences you may accidentally cut an
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
agency off at the knees and not allow
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
them to do something that you intended
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
them to be able to do or the other way
 
01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
you never intended an agency to promate
 
01:50:46.229 --> 01:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
a rule of a certain kind but the plain
 
01:50:48.189 --> 01:50:48.199 align:start position:0%
language gives them that Authority and
 
01:50:49.709 --> 01:50:49.719 align:start position:0%
so that might require a legislative
 
01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
change sometimes we don't figure those
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
things out until um till it's a jel car
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
and we identify that one of the things
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
we will do at OLS staff too is make
 
01:51:01.750 --> 01:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations if we find say
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
conflicting statutes we'll do a you know
 
01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:05.430 align:start position:0%
conflicting statutes we'll do a you know
statutory

01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
analysis whole bunch of work goes into
 
01:51:08.910 --> 01:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
that but we might make the
 
01:51:10.589 --> 01:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
recommendation for a legislative change
 
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
down the road uh is the Le is the
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
legislation going to impact currently
 
01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:16.030 align:start position:0%
legislation going to impact currently
existing

01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
existing
 
01:51:19.149 --> 01:51:19.159 align:start position:0%
rules excuse me uh will the legislation
 
01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
require an agency to write new or amend
 
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
existing rules uh are you transferring
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
power or authority and that's another
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
one which agency will have rulemaking
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
authority again um I'm using oplc as an
 
01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
example because it's it's
 
01:51:36.910 --> 01:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
really one of the more nuanced that I've
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
seen I'll use that
 
01:51:41.550 --> 01:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
term uh but you have like the oplc
 
01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
versus the Prof Professional Licensing
 
01:51:44.589 --> 01:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
boards and when I used to have to
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
testify on behalf of the oplc sort of my
 
01:51:50.350 --> 01:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
tagline was you know oplc controls the
 
01:51:52.589 --> 01:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
process the boards control the criteria
 
01:51:55.709 --> 01:51:55.719 align:start position:0%
so the oplc might control how an
 
01:51:57.870 --> 01:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
application is submitted I'll use the
 
01:51:59.950 --> 01:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine as an example again
 
01:52:01.709 --> 01:52:01.719 align:start position:0%
they might set the criteria for what it
 
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
takes to be licensed as a doctor in the
 
01:52:05.870 --> 01:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
state and then there's an interesting
 
01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:06.750 align:start position:0%
state and then there's an interesting
One

01:52:06.750 --> 01:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
One
 
01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
28421 V which is a child support and
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's got HHS components and it's got
 
01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission components and it's
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
essentially if someone is out of
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
compliance with paying child support HHS
 
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
can notify Lottery lot loty can take
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
lottery winnings and redirect them um
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting statute to read
 
01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
because it's buried in the lottery
 
01:52:35.709 --> 01:52:35.719 align:start position:0%
statute but it also has HHS rulemaking
 
01:52:39.069 --> 01:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
components so that's the kind of
 
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
thing you know it might be difficult for
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
a new HHS attorney to know that even
 
01:52:46.069 --> 01:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
exists so just sort of thinking about
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
that SPS uh parsing it out to really
 
01:52:51.629 --> 01:52:51.639 align:start position:0%
make sure roles and responsibilities are
 
01:52:51.639 --> 01:52:52.950 align:start position:0%
make sure roles and responsibilities are
clear

01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
um is helpful is helpful on both sides I
 
01:52:57.910 --> 01:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
think both for the agency and then the
 
01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
Jael car when those rules are brought
 
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
forward uh so that's just quick who we
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
are we're a very small team there's
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
myself the director um Christina munz
 
01:53:11.470 --> 01:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
who will be at doing the presentation at
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
Jael car on Friday is our senior
 
01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
Attorney Kim Rebecca our committee
 
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
attorney Scott Eaton is the former
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
director two directors ago he does some
 
01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
part-time work for us and then and we
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
have some administrative staff who takes
 
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
care of publishing the agendas the
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
Registries doing proofings for rules
 
01:53:32.109 --> 01:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
those types of things um Danielle and
 
01:53:35.229 --> 01:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
Cheryl uh so a small small little group
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
and um we work well together and we'll
 
01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
get things
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
done so we've got couple minutes left we
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
shot for an hour we're right around
 
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
name it's at the top top of that page I
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
know I know the old standby uh I can
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
spell it too uh
 
01:54:03.709 --> 01:54:03.719 align:start position:0%
osterhout osterhout Oster yes sir I say
 
01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
o t you know pronounced exactly like
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's spelled except for the silent
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
letters um that show crushed for a while
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
and then I I think I overused it and
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
committee members who would heard it so
 
01:54:17.470 --> 01:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
I had to lay off but now that we've got
 
01:54:19.390 --> 01:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
some new members on committees I'm going
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
to roll it back out for a little thank
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
you for the break yeah all right are
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
there any
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
questions all right one of the um
 
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
reasons to have us have this briefing is
 
01:54:34.589 --> 01:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
not just to learn a little bit about
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
something that's not in most people's uh
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
experience but also to meet the people
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
and know the faces and you can always
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
consult with them if you're writing a uh
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
a bill or working on a bill with rul
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
making Authority they will be very glad
 
01:54:51.629 --> 01:54:51.639 align:start position:0%
to help you because the better the the
 
01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
legislation the easier it is for
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
everybody in will
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
making thank yeah a question I have is
 
01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
if you're creating a bill and you don't
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
actually mention
 
01:55:08.950 --> 01:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
rules can rules still be
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
added normally not yeah I was gonna say
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
no typically not it the the statute
 
01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
would specifically have to reference
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
rules under 541a that's the L which we
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
look for to see if they have rle making
 
01:55:27.550 --> 01:55:27.560 align:start position:0%
auor Authority and um as mentioned
 
01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
before also specifying who has that rle
 
01:55:33.069 --> 01:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
making Authority um if neither of those
 
01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:35.679 align:start position:0%
are present then it's assumed that the
 
01:55:37.870 --> 01:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
no rules can be made under that statute
 
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
oh you just have to be careful because
 
01:55:41.310 --> 01:55:41.320 align:start position:0%
if you're sticking a paragraph in a
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
section that has rule making Authority
 
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
at the top for the whole section it you
 
01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
might have it there
 
01:55:51.189 --> 01:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
but just think about it and I think
 
01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent point because
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes with rul making Authority
 
01:55:56.790 --> 01:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
you'll look at say Board of medicines
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
Practice Act they will have a section
 
01:56:01.709 --> 01:56:01.719 align:start position:0%
that specifically says rulemaking
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
Authority it will have a list but
 
01:56:06.189 --> 01:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes in bills rule making Authority
 
01:56:08.109 --> 01:56:08.119 align:start position:0%
is carved out it's not put in that rule
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
making Authority Section it's down in
 
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:11.800 align:start position:0%
other language so we kind of have to go
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
digging for it uh but the agency should
 
01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:16.679 align:start position:0%
be flagging it for us when those notices
 
01:56:18.430 --> 01:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
come in because if they we have to track
 
01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
it down and we won't let that notice go
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
through if if they don't have the
 
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
Authority I do also want to point out I
 
01:56:26.189 --> 01:56:26.199 align:start position:0%
have some business cards so if anybody
 
01:56:28.189 --> 01:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
wants to take one before I leave so you
 
01:56:30.589 --> 01:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
can reach out to us represent Schmidt
 
01:56:33.149 --> 01:56:33.159 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you madam chair and
 
01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
just for the committee's uh uh knowledge
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
the this committee constitutes one of
 
01:56:42.669 --> 01:56:42.679 align:start position:0%
the pools of potential appointees to the
 
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
Jael car because at some point some some
 
01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
of us will be gone um and therefore uh
 
01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:51.800 align:start position:0%
Replacements typically are drawn from
 
01:56:56.350 --> 01:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
Edan a uh to because we have uh five
 
01:56:59.350 --> 01:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
regular members from the house but also
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
four or five alternates and they're
 
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
almost always from
 
01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:07.480 align:start position:0%
Edna yes and we use the alternates to
 
01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
see if they like it and if they're able
 
01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
to deal with the process so if you
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
survive being an alternate then you are
 
01:57:17.310 --> 01:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
very likely to be appointed to Jael car
 
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
and I've noticed that once you've been
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
appointed to Jael car it's very
 
01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:23.679 align:start position:0%
difficult to get off so watch it watch
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
guys yes so if a statute comes forward
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
that would repeal a certain agency's
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
rule making Authority in a certain
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
regard um would the existing rules in
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
place be repealed as well so it sort of
 
01:57:41.470 --> 01:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
depends a few things could happen one
 
01:57:45.310 --> 01:57:45.320 align:start position:0%
the statute could include uh address the
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
rul making Authority and the rules
 
01:57:48.750 --> 01:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
specifically I've seen that before where
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
it says the rules are in place until
 
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
such and such happens at which time
 
01:57:54.149 --> 01:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
they're no longer valid and then I
 
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
believe there's also if say Authority
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
switches from one agency to another
 
01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
there's a one-year natural expor
 
01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
expiration after that so the rules
 
01:58:06.069 --> 01:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
there's enough time a window sort of to
 
01:58:08.069 --> 01:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
keep them open so we're not completely
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
without rules but um they're not going
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
to last forever so it kind of makes sure
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
the agency takes action but it is
 
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
something to consider when when you make
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
maybe restructure agencies or do those
 
01:58:22.750 --> 01:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of things what's going to happen
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
to the rul making Authority who's going
 
01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
to have it what's going to happen to the
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
existing rules uh and representative
 
01:58:30.069 --> 01:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
Maguire actually shared the language
 
01:58:33.069 --> 01:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
that we used at oplc um to capture just
 
01:58:34.750 --> 01:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing when some of the
 
01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
authority was transferred from the
 
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
boards to the office yes the if you are
 
01:58:42.510 --> 01:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
doing something like that you if you
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
don't specifically address what to
 
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
happen to the rules you can assume
 
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
happen represent p well thank you madam
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
chair just to jump up on that a little
 
01:58:57.669 --> 01:58:57.679 align:start position:0%
bit if you were to remove the ru making
 
01:59:00.750 --> 01:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
Authority from an agency would now the
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
entire way they operate fall under the
 
01:59:05.470 --> 01:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
requirements of the legislature to come
 
01:59:08.189 --> 01:59:08.199 align:start position:0%
up with because they don't have the
 
01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
ability to do it
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
themselves if the agency doesn't have
 
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking authority it's probably
 
01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:17.639 align:start position:0%
advised for the legislature to put that
 
01:59:23.950 --> 01:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions all right

this

03:37:04.710 --> 03:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:37:07.189 --> 03:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
afternoon and you can see what they all

03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
questions I'm now on page three of the
 
03:37:21.070 --> 03:37:21.080 align:start position:0%

03:37:23.630 --> 03:37:23.640 align:start position:0%

retirement disability and death benefits
 
03:37:34.229 --> 03:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
as well as a post-retirement medical
 
03:37:36.870 --> 03:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
subsidy to eligible members and
 
03:37:39.110 --> 03:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries once members attain
 
03:37:40.830 --> 03:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility they can receive a
 
03:37:44.349 --> 03:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
guaranteed lifetime pension the pension
 
03:37:45.670 --> 03:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
benefits are funded through through
 
03:37:48.950 --> 03:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
employee and employeer contributions and

income historically investment returns
 
03:37:54.990 --> 03:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
have provided the majority of the
 
03:37:57.710 --> 03:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
funding for those pension benefits and
 
03:37:59.910 --> 03:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
this is typical of most public pension
 
03:38:02.349 --> 03:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
plans the higher the funded ratio which
 
03:38:04.429 --> 03:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
is something I'll talk about a bit later
 
03:38:06.469 --> 03:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
the higher the portion of the benefits
 
03:38:10.710 --> 03:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:13.600 align:start position:0%

page nhrs is a component unit of state
 
03:38:20.710 --> 03:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
government but is very different from
 
03:38:23.790 --> 03:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
most other state agencies we are not
 
03:38:27.229 --> 03:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
funded by the general fund we overseen
 
03:38:29.870 --> 03:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
by a Board of Trustees the current
 
03:38:32.790 --> 03:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
makeup on the board is shown on page

statute rules and policies and in
 
03:38:55.790 --> 03:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
addition to following New Hampshire
 
03:38:58.670 --> 03:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
state law we also have to follow the
 
03:39:01.429 --> 03:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code because we want to
 
03:39:04.830 --> 03:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
maintain our status as a qualified
 
03:39:07.550 --> 03:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
pension plan a lot of the words I'm
 
03:39:09.910 --> 03:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
going to use are terms of Art and so
 
03:39:13.389 --> 03:39:13.399 align:start position:0%
what a qualified pension plan is that's
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
a plan that the
 
03:39:20.710 --> 03:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
members can make pre-tax contributions
 
03:39:23.790 --> 03:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
into the monies in the plan earn
 
03:39:27.670 --> 03:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
investment income but are only taxed to
 
03:39:30.309 --> 03:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
those members when they begin to receive
 
03:39:32.790 --> 03:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
a benefit or their beneficiary receives
 
03:39:35.110 --> 03:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
a benefit and so we always want to make
 
03:39:37.030 --> 03:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
sure that we're on the right side of the
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue Service and maintain
 
03:39:41.590 --> 03:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
our qualified plan
 
03:39:44.189 --> 03:39:44.199 align:start position:0%

03:39:51.150 --> 03:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
36a which protects our that that our
 
03:39:54.349 --> 03:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
funds are for the exclusive purpose of
 
03:39:57.229 --> 03:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
providing benefits and it requires the
 
03:40:00.189 --> 03:40:00.199 align:start position:0%
board to certify employer rates by based
 
03:40:03.790 --> 03:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
on sound Actuarial practice and it also
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
requires that the employers who
 
03:40:08.429 --> 03:40:08.439 align:start position:0%
participate in our plan to pay the rates
 
03:40:10.510 --> 03:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
that have been certified by the
 
03:40:13.269 --> 03:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
board these constitutional Provisions
 
03:40:16.349 --> 03:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
help ensure that nhrs remain on the path
 
03:40:19.150 --> 03:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
to 100%
 
03:40:22.469 --> 03:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
funding now on page
 
03:40:26.110 --> 03:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
five the nhrs trustees have a fiduciary
 
03:40:28.309 --> 03:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
obligation to ensure that the plan is
 
03:40:32.790 --> 03:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
adequately funded the equation below
 
03:40:35.349 --> 03:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
underlies and applies to all pension
 
03:40:37.990 --> 03:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
plans the contributions plus the
 
03:40:41.309 --> 03:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
investment income need to be in balance
 
03:40:43.830 --> 03:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
with the benefit payments and the
 
03:40:46.910 --> 03:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
expenses and this equation must balance
 
03:40:49.790 --> 03:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
in the long term it relies on one of
 
03:40:52.469 --> 03:40:52.479 align:start position:0%
Albert Einstein's most important
 
03:40:55.309 --> 03:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
conclusions the compounding of interest
 
03:40:57.990 --> 03:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
is the eighth wonder of the world and
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
that's what make pensions plans work the
 
03:41:03.990 --> 03:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
contributions come in earn investment
 
03:41:07.790 --> 03:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
income that compounds over time and by
 
03:41:11.469 --> 03:41:11.479 align:start position:0%
the time members are ready to retire
 
03:41:13.510 --> 03:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
they have there are sufficient assets to
 
03:41:17.870 --> 03:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
pay their benefits as of June 30 2024 we
 
03:41:20.990 --> 03:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
had 12.3 billion in
 
03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
Investments as of the end of November we
 
03:41:27.950 --> 03:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
had 12.6 billion in
 
03:41:31.590 --> 03:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
Investments I'm now on page six this is
 
03:41:36.389 --> 03:41:36.399 align:start position:0%
a graph that shows how our assets have
 
03:41:39.389 --> 03:41:39.399 align:start position:0%
changed over time they continue to grow
 
03:41:43.990 --> 03:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:49.870 --> 03:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
trajectory now now on page seven think
 
03:41:51.950 --> 03:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
03:41:54.910 --> 03:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
please thank you this footnote here
 
03:41:57.469 --> 03:41:57.479 align:start position:0%
November sorry note 2010 was the start
 
03:41:59.670 --> 03:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
of 30-year amortization of unfunded
 
03:42:01.990 --> 03:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
liability can you explain that just a
 
03:42:04.229 --> 03:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
touch more for those of us who are
 
03:42:08.110 --> 03:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
new gladly Madame chair members of the
 
03:42:10.750 --> 03:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
committee um represent of Dees that's a
 
03:42:13.189 --> 03:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
very important question and I we we'll
 
03:42:15.950 --> 03:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
be coming back to that point at any
 
03:42:17.990 --> 03:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
times during the
 
03:42:20.880 --> 03:42:20.890 align:start position:0%
presentation the the main point is that
 
03:42:20.890 --> 03:42:22.469 align:start position:0%
presentation the the main point is that
[Music]

03:42:22.469 --> 03:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:42:26.550 --> 03:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
in 8 9 10 11 we made a lot of changes to
 
03:42:28.830 --> 03:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
the retirement system and we did
 
03:42:32.990 --> 03:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
establish a 30-year recovery plan okay
 
03:42:34.550 --> 03:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay but and and and I'll back up a
 
03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
little bit more um as I said we we'll be
 
03:42:39.870 --> 03:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
using lots of terms of art here unfunded
 
03:42:43.550 --> 03:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
liability is an Actuarial term and it is
 
03:42:46.590 --> 03:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
the difference between
 
03:42:50.910 --> 03:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
the Actuarial acred liability what is
 
03:42:53.750 --> 03:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
the present value of all of the benefits
 
03:42:56.309 --> 03:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
that our members have earned and are
 
03:42:59.790 --> 03:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
expected to be paid in the future and
 
03:43:03.309 --> 03:43:03.319 align:start position:0%
the Actuarial value of assets the
 
03:43:06.309 --> 03:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
Actuarial value of assets is different
 
03:43:09.630 --> 03:43:09.640 align:start position:0%
from the fair market value of assets the
 
03:43:11.710 --> 03:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
fair market value of assets which I just
 
03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned it was
 
03:43:15.630 --> 03:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
12.3 billion
 
03:43:17.550 --> 03:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
on June 30
 
03:43:21.910 --> 03:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
2024 um what actuaries like to do is
 
03:43:24.550 --> 03:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
they like to smooth assets over a
 
03:43:29.389 --> 03:43:29.399 align:start position:0%
fiveyear period so that no one good year
 
03:43:31.670 --> 03:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
of performance or one bad year of
 
03:43:35.590 --> 03:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
performance has a dramatic impact on the
 
03:43:36.910 --> 03:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
condition of the
 
03:43:42.590 --> 03:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
plan and so back as the chair noted
 
03:43:44.429 --> 03:43:44.439 align:start position:0%
there was a significant unfunded
 
03:43:44.439 --> 03:43:45.630 align:start position:0%
there was a significant unfunded
liability

03:43:45.630 --> 03:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
liability
 
03:43:45.640 --> 03:43:47.269 align:start position:0%
liability
in

03:43:47.269 --> 03:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:43:51.309 --> 03:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
um 2010 it was approx a little bit over
 
03:43:51.319 --> 03:43:52.510 align:start position:0%
um 2010 it was approx a little bit over
um5

03:43:52.510 --> 03:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
um5
 
03:43:55.110 --> 03:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
billion and rather than try to pay that
 
03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
all off at once which I think we all
 
03:43:59.030 --> 03:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
know that the state of New Hampshire
 
03:44:01.950 --> 03:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the assets to do that they
 
03:44:05.910 --> 03:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
decide the legislature decided on a plan
 
03:44:10.349 --> 03:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
to amortise that unfunded liability over
 
03:44:12.229 --> 03:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
a 30-year
 
03:44:15.750 --> 03:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
period editorial comment is that they
 
03:44:18.870 --> 03:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
chose the longest possible period of
 
03:44:20.950 --> 03:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
amortization and the method of
 
03:44:23.269 --> 03:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
amortization that provided the lowest
 
03:44:26.870 --> 03:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
initial cost as you would expect from
 
03:44:31.349 --> 03:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
most of our other uh Financial plans but
 
03:44:33.550 --> 03:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
we are playing we are paying it off oh
 
03:44:37.110 --> 03:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
we are exactly and in 2017 when it was
 
03:44:40.910 --> 03:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
decided that we needed to amortise any
 
03:44:43.550 --> 03:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
additional unfunded liabilities that
 
03:44:49.030 --> 03:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
were generated in 20 2017 or later those
 
03:44:51.429 --> 03:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
liabilities those gains or losses
 
03:44:54.590 --> 03:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
depending upon what happened that in
 
03:44:58.110 --> 03:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
that period those will all be advertised
 
03:45:00.149 --> 03:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
over a closed
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:06.750 --> 03:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
period we learned a little does that
 
03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
make sense as much as it can yes and
 
03:45:13.630 --> 03:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
thank you okay there are two
 
03:45:15.630 --> 03:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
te or
 
03:45:17.590 --> 03:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
multiple could be
 
03:45:19.950 --> 03:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
M Madam chair for the sake of folks at
 
03:45:27.189 --> 03:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:30.389 --> 03:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
microphone forget
 
03:45:32.710 --> 03:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
it I don't want to steal all of my
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
thunder but towards the end of the
 
03:45:36.389 --> 03:45:36.399 align:start position:0%
conver the presentation there will be a
 
03:45:39.349 --> 03:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
chart which explains the different tiers
 
03:45:41.149 --> 03:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:45:41.159 --> 03:45:43.110 align:start position:0%
of the
amortization

03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
amortization
 
03:45:51.830 --> 03:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:51.840 --> 03:45:53.429 align:start position:0%
 
busy

03:45:53.429 --> 03:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
busy
 
03:45:55.950 --> 03:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
yes ju just to clarify the method of
 
03:45:58.510 --> 03:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
amortization was issuance of bonds or
 
03:45:59.870 --> 03:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
some other
 
03:46:02.830 --> 03:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle um Madame chair members of the
 
03:46:02.840 --> 03:46:04.990 align:start position:0%
vehicle um Madame chair members of the
committee

03:46:04.990 --> 03:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:46:08.950 --> 03:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:15.030 --> 03:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
OHA um it is um being paid off through
 
03:46:17.349 --> 03:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
essentially employer contributions and
 
03:46:19.830 --> 03:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
when we have a discussion later on on
 
03:46:22.389 --> 03:46:22.399 align:start position:0%
the employer contributions and how they
 
03:46:26.830 --> 03:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
are calculated um you'll see
 
03:46:31.229 --> 03:46:31.239 align:start position:0%
that yes it we did not Bond it where we
 
03:46:33.630 --> 03:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
we basically took out a lean against
 
03:46:37.269 --> 03:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
every employer which is which is the m
 
03:46:40.189 --> 03:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the state
 
03:46:43.189 --> 03:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
itself yes also to where your brains
 
03:46:45.269 --> 03:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
going the Senate did attempt to bond it
 
03:46:48.429 --> 03:46:48.439 align:start position:0%
and was told Federal by the IRS uh and
 
03:46:50.149 --> 03:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
the federal government that we cannot do
 
03:46:52.710 --> 03:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
that so there was an attempt
 
03:46:55.790 --> 03:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
by um some members of the legislature
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
yeah by the um the senator out of
 
03:47:00.670 --> 03:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester to look at actually
 
03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
bonding that but we just can't do it so
 
03:47:10.309 --> 03:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:10.319 --> 03:47:11.950 align:start position:0%
 
Avenue

03:47:11.950 --> 03:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
Avenue
 
03:47:15.189 --> 03:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
okay so what we've been working at most
 
03:47:18.349 --> 03:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
recently at nhrs is we've been doing a
 
03:47:20.630 --> 03:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
huge pension application upgrade our
 
03:47:24.030 --> 03:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
pension Gold version three we have made
 
03:47:26.590 --> 03:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
updates to the to the Strategic asset
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
allocation plan we continue to take
 
03:47:32.429 --> 03:47:32.439 align:start position:0%
cyber security very seriously and are
 
03:47:35.429 --> 03:47:35.439 align:start position:0%
constantly enhancing and training our
 
03:47:38.229 --> 03:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
employees we have we've continued to
 
03:47:41.030 --> 03:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
enhance the education effort efforts for
 
03:47:43.149 --> 03:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
our members employers and the general
 
03:47:46.030 --> 03:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
public we now have a new five-year
 
03:47:49.229 --> 03:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
strategic plan for the investment office
 
03:47:51.510 --> 03:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
and we've also enhanced our efforts to
 
03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
increase the number of members using my
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
account which is our online portal for
 
03:47:59.030 --> 03:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
members when we now have over 30,000
 
03:48:01.349 --> 03:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
users of on that
 
03:48:04.189 --> 03:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
platform on page eight I will now turn
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
things briefly over to CFO Marie Mullen
 
03:48:10.349 --> 03:48:10.359 align:start position:0%
to discuss to update you on some
 
03:48:12.149 --> 03:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
initiatives in her
 
03:48:15.790 --> 03:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
area thank you yes you don't really need
 
03:48:18.469 --> 03:48:18.479 align:start position:0%
to read the charts because yeah there is
 
03:48:21.429 --> 03:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
a literacy test to join the committee
 
03:48:24.269 --> 03:48:24.279 align:start position:0%
okay and we just want to want you to
 
03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
give us the highlights and your opinions
 
03:48:28.269 --> 03:48:28.279 align:start position:0%
because that's a much more effective way
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
to present the data absolutely um we
 
03:48:33.030 --> 03:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to provide an update in the
 
03:48:35.349 --> 03:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
finance area because during the the
 
03:48:38.189 --> 03:48:38.199 align:start position:0%
implementation some of you may have had
 
03:48:40.910 --> 03:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
um requests from employers or heard
 
03:48:42.630 --> 03:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
things about it so we wanted to kind of
 
03:48:45.070 --> 03:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
update you on what we've done to address
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
some of the employer concerns some of
 
03:48:49.429 --> 03:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
the areas that we um
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
identified um improvements that needed
 
03:48:54.469 --> 03:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
to occur so this slide outlines some of
 
03:48:56.469 --> 03:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
those um some of it was a structural
 
03:48:59.630 --> 03:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
change internally where we um have now
 
03:49:01.590 --> 03:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
assigned our employer reporting
 
03:49:04.389 --> 03:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
specialist to a specific employer for
 
03:49:06.269 --> 03:49:06.279 align:start position:0%
the city Town municipality school
 
03:49:08.229 --> 03:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
district and they have one person to
 
03:49:10.030 --> 03:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
deal with previously they could be
 
03:49:12.149 --> 03:49:12.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with multiple folks um there
 
03:49:15.750 --> 03:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
would be confusion repetition of of um
 
03:49:18.269 --> 03:49:18.279 align:start position:0%
you know problems so we we've addressed
 
03:49:19.830 --> 03:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
that and we so we've assigned one
 
03:49:22.030 --> 03:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
individual person to work with them from
 
03:49:24.469 --> 03:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
reporting to cash collection to
 
03:49:26.710 --> 03:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
reconciliation of their accounts that
 
03:49:29.550 --> 03:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
has received very good feedback um and
 
03:49:32.070 --> 03:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
has been well received by the employers
 
03:49:35.229 --> 03:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
um we also conducted listening sessions
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
to hear the problems that they were
 
03:49:39.189 --> 03:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
having what what was missing what
 
03:49:41.670 --> 03:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
reports did they need so we identified
 
03:49:43.110 --> 03:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
some of that through the employer
 
03:49:46.070 --> 03:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
sessions we have um produced
 
03:49:48.389 --> 03:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
enhancements within the system we have
 
03:49:50.110 --> 03:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
created new reports to assist the
 
03:49:52.389 --> 03:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
employers so we wanted to provide that
 
03:49:54.030 --> 03:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
information as well over the past year
 
03:49:57.070 --> 03:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
we've done some of those things as well
 
03:49:59.750 --> 03:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and we are looking at automating and
 
03:50:01.630 --> 03:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
streamlining much of our processes
 
03:50:04.830 --> 03:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
related to cash receipts um and then on
 
03:50:07.510 --> 03:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
the finance like investment side we are
 
03:50:10.269 --> 03:50:10.279 align:start position:0%
also looking at Automation and
 
03:50:12.389 --> 03:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
transparency related to our investment
 
03:50:14.870 --> 03:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
management fees and being able to break
 
03:50:16.710 --> 03:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
those out more individually to the
 
03:50:19.349 --> 03:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
manager and being able to see the the
 
03:50:21.389 --> 03:50:21.399 align:start position:0%
performance from our managers based on
 
03:50:24.990 --> 03:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
the fees um more proactively so these
 
03:50:26.469 --> 03:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
are just some of the areas in in the
 
03:50:27.950 --> 03:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
finance side that we've been improving
 
03:50:29.870 --> 03:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
on we wanted to bring to the committee's
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
attention in case you are hearing
 
03:50:33.710 --> 03:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
feedback from any of your
 
03:50:35.630 --> 03:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
constituents and with that I'll turn it
 
03:50:39.229 --> 03:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:43.830 --> 03:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
Jen okay now on page nine um for many
 
03:50:47.309 --> 03:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
years and HRS has been a tenant in
 
03:50:50.670 --> 03:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
commercial real estate our current lease
 
03:50:53.110 --> 03:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
expires in March of
 
03:50:56.990 --> 03:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
2026 and we need to provide notice of
 
03:51:00.349 --> 03:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
renewal or not to our landb Lord by May
 
03:51:00.359 --> 03:51:01.349 align:start position:0%
renewal or not to our landb Lord by May
of

03:51:01.349 --> 03:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:51:04.750 --> 03:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
2025 so we decided to take this as an
 
03:51:06.510 --> 03:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see if there would be
 
03:51:09.630 --> 03:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
another more coste effective space from
 
03:51:12.670 --> 03:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
which we could house our staff and
 
03:51:17.429 --> 03:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
provide member service so we followed a
 
03:51:20.870 --> 03:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
very deliberate process um the board
 
03:51:23.670 --> 03:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
chair appointed four members um to an ad
 
03:51:26.429 --> 03:51:26.439 align:start position:0%
hoc real estate committee and five staff
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
members including the three of us um
 
03:51:33.269 --> 03:51:33.279 align:start position:0%
were um selected to support their work
 
03:51:35.590 --> 03:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
we worked with a broker kushman and
 
03:51:38.030 --> 03:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
Wakefield to review lease and purch
 
03:51:40.790 --> 03:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
options in central New
 
03:51:45.149 --> 03:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then after um we took a
 
03:51:48.149 --> 03:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
total cost of occupancy approach and
 
03:51:50.469 --> 03:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
considered the all the costs of renting
 
03:51:53.070 --> 03:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
versus owning to make an informed
 
03:51:55.590 --> 03:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
decision and after a comprehensive
 
03:51:57.429 --> 03:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
review of the different options the
 
03:51:59.990 --> 03:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
board approved us to enter into a
 
03:52:02.910 --> 03:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
contract for purchase since then we've
 
03:52:05.670 --> 03:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
engaged in a very thorough due diligence
 
03:52:07.830 --> 03:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
we've done a site assessment building
 
03:52:09.910 --> 03:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
condition and title search and no
 
03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
material exceptions were
 
03:52:15.870 --> 03:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
discovered page eight summarizes the
 
03:52:18.910 --> 03:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
current situation um we're in at least
 
03:52:21.790 --> 03:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
space in conquer over on 54 Regional
 
03:52:25.349 --> 03:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
drive and our new premises will be just
 
03:52:29.189 --> 03:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
north of here over in the Horseshoe Pond
 
03:52:31.590 --> 03:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
um we're purchasing a threeory building
 
03:52:33.790 --> 03:52:33.800 align:start position:0%
which as as you can tell has very easy
 
03:52:36.149 --> 03:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
access to the um the different highways
 
03:52:37.950 --> 03:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
that go through this area so it'll be
 
03:52:41.550 --> 03:52:41.560 align:start position:0%
very convenient for our members it's a
 
03:52:44.790 --> 03:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
32,000 square foot building the purchase
 
03:52:46.189 --> 03:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
price is $5
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
million and we expect to close in March
 
03:52:54.790 --> 03:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:57.750 --> 03:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
date page
 
03:53:00.229 --> 03:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
11 um this walks you through some of the
 
03:53:03.469 --> 03:53:03.479 align:start position:0%
significant developments since
 
03:53:07.870 --> 03:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
2007 um as noted earlier in 2010 the
 
03:53:10.950 --> 03:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
30-year amortization of the unfunded
 
03:53:14.710 --> 03:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
liability begins that's what UA stands
 
03:53:18.670 --> 03:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
for and what has impacted to a great
 
03:53:21.469 --> 03:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
degree the unfunded liability is the
 
03:53:23.950 --> 03:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
different changes we've had to our rate
 
03:53:26.269 --> 03:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
of return you can see that happened in
 
03:53:29.550 --> 03:53:29.560 align:start position:0%
2011 2016 and
 
03:53:32.189 --> 03:53:32.199 align:start position:0%
2020 and for those of you who are
 
03:53:34.950 --> 03:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
Finance people you know that when you
 
03:53:37.950 --> 03:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
lower the discount rate the present
 
03:53:40.790 --> 03:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
value becomes higher and so every time
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
we lowered our assumed rate of return
 
03:53:50.229 --> 03:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:52.750 --> 03:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
increased page
 
03:53:56.070 --> 03:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
12 the next few pages outline different
 
03:53:59.149 --> 03:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
benefit changes since 2020 and they
 
03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
generally fall into two different
 
03:54:04.710 --> 03:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
categories in ad hoc inflation
 
03:54:06.950 --> 03:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
protection for retirees and
 
03:54:09.910 --> 03:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries as well as the restoration
 
03:54:12.309 --> 03:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
of group two benefits that were reduced
 
03:54:14.469 --> 03:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
in 2011
 
03:54:18.670 --> 03:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
so the change in 2020 um for the onetime
 
03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
cola affected both group one and group
 
03:54:24.790 --> 03:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
two further down on that page there was
 
03:54:29.550 --> 03:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
a one-time temporary um salary temporary
 
03:54:32.149 --> 03:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
supplemental allowance um for some
 
03:54:34.590 --> 03:54:34.600 align:start position:0%
retirees and that affected group one and
 
03:54:34.600 --> 03:54:35.429 align:start position:0%
retirees and that affected group one and
group

03:54:35.429 --> 03:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
group
 
03:54:37.389 --> 03:54:37.399 align:start position:0%
two page
 
03:54:42.309 --> 03:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
13 is was a change the first one from
 
03:54:45.269 --> 03:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
2023 was a change
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
to um the group two benefits to restore
 
03:54:50.550 --> 03:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
part of the benefits that were reduced
 
03:54:50.560 --> 03:54:51.910 align:start position:0%
part of the benefits that were reduced
in

03:54:51.910 --> 03:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:54:53.950 --> 03:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
2011 and
 
03:54:57.790 --> 03:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
then on lower down on that page um that
 
03:55:01.030 --> 03:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
bill um augments um the benefit for
 
03:55:03.269 --> 03:55:03.279 align:start position:0%
group one members have pushing by
 
03:55:05.590 --> 03:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
pushing out the date at which the
 
03:55:08.110 --> 03:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
benefit reduction takes place so it's
 
03:55:12.550 --> 03:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
now aligned with the full retirement age
 
03:55:15.110 --> 03:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
under Social Security before it had been
 
03:55:15.120 --> 03:55:18.750 align:start position:0%

03:55:24.189 --> 03:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
um from
 
03:55:27.070 --> 03:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
2024 the one on this page is a new
 
03:55:30.630 --> 03:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
benefit for eligible group two
 
03:55:35.110 --> 03:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
members page 15 another um temporary
 
03:55:37.710 --> 03:55:37.720 align:start position:0%
supplemental allowance um which benefits
 
03:55:40.630 --> 03:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
both group one and group two members and
 
03:55:43.630 --> 03:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
this this TSA temporary supplemental
 
03:55:45.590 --> 03:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
allowance was paid in the months of
 
03:55:47.710 --> 03:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
November and December to the eligible
 
03:55:51.630 --> 03:55:51.640 align:start position:0%

03:55:56.510 --> 03:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
legislation from
 
03:56:01.229 --> 03:56:01.239 align:start position:0%
2024 this bill only affected group two
 
03:56:04.670 --> 03:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
members and was also another attempt to
 
03:56:08.429 --> 03:56:08.439 align:start position:0%
restore benefits that were reduced in
 
03:56:11.030 --> 03:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
2011 as you can see there's been a large
 
03:56:13.870 --> 03:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
volume of benefit related legislation in
 
03:56:16.070 --> 03:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
the past few years and I doubt that this
 
03:56:18.469 --> 03:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
year will be any
 
03:56:23.269 --> 03:56:23.279 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire retirement system me
 
03:56:28.630 --> 03:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
membership covers a broad range of
 
03:56:30.429 --> 03:56:30.439 align:start position:0%
public employees throughout New
 
03:56:33.429 --> 03:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we divide our members into two
 
03:56:35.630 --> 03:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
groups one the first one is group one
 
03:56:37.590 --> 03:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
which covers the employees and the
 
03:56:40.030 --> 03:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
teachers so the employees that include
 
03:56:42.670 --> 03:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
state employees City and
 
03:56:45.870 --> 03:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
County employees as well group two are
 
03:56:47.950 --> 03:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
the police and fire

employees we have 468 participating
 
03:56:54.710 --> 03:56:54.720 align:start position:0%

03:57:09.309 --> 03:57:09.319 align:start position:0%
employees page 18 shows you how many of
 
03:57:13.110 --> 03:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
our members are in each of the group um
 
03:57:15.990 --> 03:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:57:18.229 --> 03:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
um the the the employees and the
 
03:57:19.990 --> 03:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
teachers are the group one police and
 
03:57:22.590 --> 03:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
fire are group two so you can see for
 
03:57:24.269 --> 03:57:24.279 align:start position:0%
yourselves how many members of the
 
03:57:26.990 --> 03:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
different categories we have as well as
 
03:57:31.229 --> 03:57:31.239 align:start position:0%

information page
 
03:57:36.389 --> 03:57:36.399 align:start position:0%
19 um we Rec cross an important
 
03:57:39.110 --> 03:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
threshold in fiscal year 2024 it was the
 
03:57:41.670 --> 03:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
first year in which we paid $1 billion
 
03:57:44.229 --> 03:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
dollar in pension benefits to our
 
03:57:46.510 --> 03:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
retirees and
 
03:57:49.389 --> 03:57:49.399 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries and over that same time we
 
03:57:51.309 --> 03:57:51.319 align:start position:0%
paid close to 40 million in
 
03:57:53.830 --> 03:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
post-retirement medical subsidy to the
 
03:57:55.790 --> 03:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
eligible retirees and
 
03:57:57.790 --> 03:57:57.800 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries and the reason why that
 
03:58:00.870 --> 03:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
billion dollars is so important 80% of
 
03:58:03.590 --> 03:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
our retirees and beneficiaries remain
 
03:58:05.910 --> 03:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and these payments
 
03:58:08.309 --> 03:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
have a significant impact on the local
 
03:58:10.950 --> 03:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
economies throughout New
 
03:58:14.590 --> 03:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire page 20 this is a graph so you
 
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
can see how much of the benefits go into
 
03:58:23.469 --> 03:58:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:27.149 --> 03:58:27.159 align:start position:0%
counties page 21 is a description of the
 
03:58:29.309 --> 03:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
different types of benefits we have we
 
03:58:32.030 --> 03:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
have four different types of retirement
 
03:58:33.750 --> 03:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
um there are different benefit
 
03:58:36.030 --> 03:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
Provisions that apply to our group one
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
and our group two
 
03:58:40.510 --> 03:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
members and there's also different
 
03:58:42.750 --> 03:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
benefits Provisions that are applied
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
based on the vested stat is on the date
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
of hire we now have three tiers of
 
03:58:54.070 --> 03:58:54.080 align:start position:0%

this page NH HRS pays modest benefits to
 
03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
our members you'll see that there's um
 
03:59:08.990 --> 03:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
that the group two members have on
 
03:59:11.870 --> 03:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
average have higher benefits but you
 
03:59:13.469 --> 03:59:13.479 align:start position:0%
have to remember that our group two
 
03:59:17.750 --> 03:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
members do do not participate in Social
 
03:59:20.429 --> 03:59:20.439 align:start position:0%
Security and also note that our none of
 
03:59:22.910 --> 03:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
our plans include automatic cost of
 
03:59:22.920 --> 03:59:25.149 align:start position:0%
our plans include automatic cost of
living

03:59:25.149 --> 03:59:25.159 align:start position:0%

03:59:28.269 --> 03:59:28.279 align:start position:0%
adjustments page 23 shows the
 
03:59:30.030 --> 03:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
distribution of
 
03:59:32.710 --> 03:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
benefits approximately 2third of our
 
03:59:34.910 --> 03:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
members retire with a benefit that's
 
03:59:35.910 --> 03:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
less than
 
03:59:41.790 --> 03:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
$25,000 a year and very few only 2% have
 
03:59:44.550 --> 03:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
a benefit that's greater than $755,000
 
03:59:44.560 --> 03:59:47.670 align:start position:0%

contribution rates the employer
 
04:00:30.469 --> 04:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
contributions are certified by the
 
04:00:33.070 --> 04:00:33.080 align:start position:0%
trustees on a bial basis and the
 
04:00:35.229 --> 04:00:35.239 align:start position:0%
timeline for this process is shown on

04:00:43.269 --> 04:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
52 and this slide makes note of a
 
04:00:48.189 --> 04:00:48.199 align:start position:0%
subsidy to local employers um
 
04:00:51.030 --> 04:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
for um the contributions that they pay
 
04:00:53.670 --> 04:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
there was one in 2022 and this year
 
04:00:55.870 --> 04:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
there's also similar legislation that's
 
04:00:55.880 --> 04:00:59.189 align:start position:0%
there's also similar legislation that's
being

04:00:59.189 --> 04:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:02.790 --> 04:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
considered page 26 contributions and
 
04:01:06.469 --> 04:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
funding every two years nhrs has our
 
04:01:09.910 --> 04:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
actuary do a detailed Actuarial
 
04:01:12.710 --> 04:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
valuation and they calculate the funding
 
04:01:14.830 --> 04:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
status which is what's known as our
 
04:01:17.910 --> 04:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
funded ratio that's the the metric that
 
04:01:21.469 --> 04:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
many plans use to assess how well they
 
04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
are doing on their funding what that is
 
04:01:30.910 --> 04:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
it's the value of the Actuarial acred
 
04:01:34.510 --> 04:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
liability liability divided by the
 
04:01:37.229 --> 04:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
Actuarial value of assets so it tells
 
04:01:40.590 --> 04:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
you how much how many cents per dollar
 
04:01:42.990 --> 04:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
are on hand to pay each dollar of
 
04:01:45.469 --> 04:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
benefits that will be paid in the
 
04:01:48.750 --> 04:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
future and as a result of this valuation
 
04:01:52.229 --> 04:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
that's used to um to set our employer
 
04:01:55.469 --> 04:01:55.479 align:start position:0%
rates which have to be
 
04:01:58.630 --> 04:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
sufficient and every four years we do an
 
04:02:01.189 --> 04:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
experience study we just completed one
 
04:02:04.229 --> 04:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2024 that covered the
 
04:02:07.910 --> 04:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
prior four years and when the actuaries
 
04:02:10.950 --> 04:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
do this what they do is they lift up um
 
04:02:14.910 --> 04:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
the roof of the car the lid of the
 
04:02:18.830 --> 04:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
the engine I'm not a car person um and
 
04:02:22.030 --> 04:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
they look at every single assumption
 
04:02:23.990 --> 04:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
that goes into
 
04:02:28.110 --> 04:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
making the the liabilities they look at
 
04:02:30.630 --> 04:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
how long are the members supposed to
 
04:02:33.349 --> 04:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
live what how at what age are they going
 
04:02:36.710 --> 04:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
to retire How likely is any one member
 
04:02:38.830 --> 04:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
to terminate their benefit before
 
04:02:43.830 --> 04:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for uh for terminate
 
04:02:45.950 --> 04:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
employment before they're eligible for a
 
04:02:51.950 --> 04:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
benefit um they look at mortality rates
 
04:02:54.510 --> 04:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
they look at what's going on in the
 
04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
economy what is do they expect for
 
04:03:00.389 --> 04:03:00.399 align:start position:0%
future salary increases to be and then
 
04:03:02.790 --> 04:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
one of the most important numbers is
 
04:03:05.389 --> 04:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
what do they think our assumed rate of
 
04:03:07.870 --> 04:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
return is going to be we were very
 
04:03:09.550 --> 04:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
pleased with the
 
04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
2023 experience study that they
 
04:03:14.590 --> 04:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
recommended keeping our our annual rate
 
04:03:17.429 --> 04:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
of return at
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
6.75% so that was a big relief to all of
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
us and I just want to also let you know
 
04:03:26.590 --> 04:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
that this year we're in the process of
 
04:03:28.950 --> 04:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
conducting an Actuarial
 
04:03:33.630 --> 04:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
audit so what that means is is that we
 
04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
have our regular actuary that has worked
 
04:03:39.149 --> 04:03:39.159 align:start position:0%
with us for over 10 years we have
 
04:03:42.030 --> 04:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
another actuary come in and essentially
 
04:03:44.469 --> 04:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
look over their shoulder they review all
 
04:03:46.510 --> 04:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
the calculations they've made they look
 
04:03:48.630 --> 04:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
at every assumption that the actuaries
 
04:03:50.750 --> 04:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
have made to see if they all are
 
04:03:52.870 --> 04:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable and so it's like it's
 
04:03:55.070 --> 04:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
basically getting a second opinion and
 
04:03:57.630 --> 04:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
this is considered a best practice in
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
government government circles it's
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
recommended by the gfoa that pension
 
04:04:04.990 --> 04:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
plant do this every five years and we
 
04:04:07.910 --> 04:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
were due so we're having that done this
 
04:04:07.920 --> 04:04:09.590 align:start position:0%
were due so we're having that done this
year

04:04:09.590 --> 04:04:09.600 align:start position:0%

Association

04:04:20.030 --> 04:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:23.550 --> 04:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
page I'm on now on page 27 our employer
 
04:04:25.710 --> 04:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
contributions are comprised of these
 
04:04:28.790 --> 04:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
three components the normal cost that is
 
04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
directly related to how much what
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
percent of an employee salary do we have
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
to withhold to pay their benefit in the
 
04:04:41.710 --> 04:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
future then there's the unfunded
 
04:04:43.750 --> 04:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
liability which is the big gorilla in
 
04:04:43.760 --> 04:04:45.950 align:start position:0%
liability which is the big gorilla in
the

04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
room and then there's also the medical
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
subsidy which is a closed benefit and
 
04:04:54.990 --> 04:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
it's funded on a pay as youo
 
04:04:56.910 --> 04:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
rate page
 
04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
28 this chart shows what percent of each
 
04:05:01.950 --> 04:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
of these components are in the
 
04:05:04.189 --> 04:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
contribution as you can see the
 
04:05:06.349 --> 04:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of the employer
 
04:05:09.070 --> 04:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
contribution goes towards amortising the
 
04:05:09.080 --> 04:05:10.469 align:start position:0%
contribution goes towards amortising the
unfunded

04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
04:05:12.790 --> 04:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
liability and you can see that ranges
 
04:05:15.110 --> 04:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
from anywhere between between
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
77.3% and
 
04:05:20.189 --> 04:05:20.199 align:start position:0%
84.2% depending upon which employee
 
04:05:21.790 --> 04:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
group we're talking
 
04:05:25.710 --> 04:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
about and this chart also notes that the
 
04:05:27.750 --> 04:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
member the member share of the normal
 
04:05:30.510 --> 04:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
cost which they all pay in contributions
 
04:05:33.030 --> 04:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
the Actuarial convention is that all of
 
04:05:35.110 --> 04:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
the members contribution rate is
 
04:05:37.830 --> 04:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
allocated to the normal cost of their
 
04:05:39.870 --> 04:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
benefit may I bring you back for a
 
04:05:42.990 --> 04:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
moment uh the medical subsidy does the
 
04:05:45.189 --> 04:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
term close close to benefit mean this
 
04:05:45.199 --> 04:05:46.229 align:start position:0%
term close close to benefit mean this
will

04:05:46.229 --> 04:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:05:49.229 --> 04:05:49.239 align:start position:0%
end yes it does it's for a finite group
 
04:05:49.239 --> 04:05:51.710 align:start position:0%
end yes it does it's for a finite group
of

04:05:51.710 --> 04:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
people repres PE Madam chair
 
04:05:58.670 --> 04:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh so for for
 
04:06:01.269 --> 04:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
clarification as an example under the
 
04:06:03.870 --> 04:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
slide you're on 28 normal cost looking
 
04:06:06.110 --> 04:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
at specifically group two because of
 
04:06:09.870 --> 04:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
their lack of social security
 
04:06:11.710 --> 04:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
requirements um that the cities and
 
04:06:14.269 --> 04:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
towns don't have to pay into
 
04:06:15.590 --> 04:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
so if I'm reading this right you're
 
04:06:17.590 --> 04:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
saying that the normal normal cost of
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
operation if we had no unfunded
 
04:06:22.269 --> 04:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
liability for police would be 5.8 and
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
fire would be
 
04:06:26.990 --> 04:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
6.1% is that was is that fair to say if
 
04:06:28.630 --> 04:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
we had no pension debt at all that's
 
04:06:30.269 --> 04:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
what it would cost to
 
04:06:33.229 --> 04:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
operate group two um that's what it
 
04:06:36.349 --> 04:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
would cost to pay the employer share of
 
04:06:40.229 --> 04:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
the normal cost the um the member
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
contribution rates are on
 
04:06:45.189 --> 04:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
on page
 
04:06:48.429 --> 04:06:48.439 align:start position:0%
25 yeah and so you would have to add the
 
04:06:50.670 --> 04:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
member share plus the employer share to
 
04:06:52.950 --> 04:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
get to arrive at the total normal cost
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
do you have a do you have a normal cost
 
04:06:56.550 --> 04:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:06:58.990 --> 04:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
employer that is the normal cost
 
04:07:03.510 --> 04:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
employer this is that the far left hand
 
04:07:06.189 --> 04:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
column the the 58 and the 610 yes okay
 
04:07:08.349 --> 04:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
so that's the
 
04:07:12.750 --> 04:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
employer normal cost okay so what what
 
04:07:16.189 --> 04:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
social security refresh my memory is
 
04:07:18.389 --> 04:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
6.75% I think you've transposed the
 
04:07:21.189 --> 04:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
digits I believe it's 7.65 and that also
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
includes Medicare 7.65 is what a
 
04:07:26.109 --> 04:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
municipality would pay in Social
 
04:07:28.229 --> 04:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
Security responsibility to the federal
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
government for for that so with that
 
04:07:34.189 --> 04:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
being said then what what I'm reading
 
04:07:36.349 --> 04:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
here and what you're saying is it's
 
04:07:38.510 --> 04:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
cheaper to operate this system than if
 
04:07:46.269 --> 04:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:50.030 --> 04:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
for group two yes because in the P this
 
04:07:53.070 --> 04:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
pension system the employers are paying
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
2third or so of the cost whereas with
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
Social Security it's only about
 
04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
half I don't think that's what this says
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to that's what
 
04:08:05.429 --> 04:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get out no I mean the the
 
04:08:09.910 --> 04:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
member share of the normal cost is
 
04:08:11.950 --> 04:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
between 66 and
 
04:08:15.229 --> 04:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
74% of the total normal cost of
 
04:08:17.630 --> 04:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
providing the pension so they're paying
 
04:08:20.070 --> 04:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
for example I'll use employees because
 
04:08:21.630 --> 04:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
the numbers are are
 
04:08:25.309 --> 04:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
simpler the employee pays 7% the
 
04:08:30.590 --> 04:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:33.870 --> 04:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
2.4% that's right off the table can you
 
04:08:35.710 --> 04:08:35.720 align:start position:0%
can you highlight that for me because I
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
I'm missing I'm missing what that is
 
04:08:38.910 --> 04:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
okay the normal cost is what it would do
 
04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
to the pension if we had no debt right
 
04:08:43.950 --> 04:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
are you on page 28 slide 28 right
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the for an employee it's
 
04:08:51.229 --> 04:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
2.42% from the employer and by Statute
 
04:08:53.229 --> 04:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
the employee pay
 
04:08:56.269 --> 04:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
7% That's for group one for group one
 
04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
for group two the I don't know it's 11
 
04:09:03.469 --> 04:09:03.479 align:start position:0%
or 12% roughly 1155 and 118 yep thank
 
04:09:06.670 --> 04:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
you and the employer contribution is
 
04:09:09.389 --> 04:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
about is slightly more than half that
 
04:09:12.910 --> 04:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
it's 5.8 and 6.1 so the employer
 
04:09:15.469 --> 04:09:15.479 align:start position:0%
employee are paying the greatest share
 
04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
of their basic pension so so what I what
 
04:09:21.389 --> 04:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
I was asking you um director
 
04:09:24.830 --> 04:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
is because group two the employees that
 
04:09:27.149 --> 04:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
are group two the municipalities are not
 
04:09:29.349 --> 04:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
contributing to Social Security that
 
04:09:30.990 --> 04:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
they're not that's not a liability they
 
04:09:34.670 --> 04:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
have to meet the operation of group
 
04:09:37.710 --> 04:09:37.720 align:start position:0%
two the normal cost is less than simply
 
04:09:40.269 --> 04:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
just paying Social Security that's
 
04:09:44.590 --> 04:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to confirm here
 
04:09:47.349 --> 04:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes that's corre yes okay
 
04:09:49.510 --> 04:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
right because that's important to
 
04:09:53.710 --> 04:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
to um to understand with the differences
 
04:09:56.070 --> 04:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
between group one and group two as to
 
04:09:58.670 --> 04:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
why group two exists it's a it's a
 
04:10:00.870 --> 04:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
financial benefit for the municipalities
 
04:10:02.510 --> 04:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
because they don't because of the wi
 
04:10:03.870 --> 04:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
Federal windfall act they don't have to
 
04:10:07.030 --> 04:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
pay in that 7.65% liability to the
 
04:10:09.710 --> 04:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
federal government they can simply just
 
04:10:11.189 --> 04:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
operate under the normal costs you have
 
04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
listed to make that system work
 
04:10:17.710 --> 04:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
yes and for the benefit of new employee
 
04:10:17.720 --> 04:10:18.510 align:start position:0%
yes and for the benefit of new employee
new

04:10:18.510 --> 04:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:10:22.030 --> 04:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
members we in once we start paying down
 
04:10:25.590 --> 04:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
the liability so that the that is not
 
04:10:27.870 --> 04:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
dominating the employer
 
04:10:29.790 --> 04:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
contributions we
 
04:10:31.750 --> 04:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
require the
 
04:10:34.950 --> 04:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
employee contribution to go down so that
 
04:10:39.309 --> 04:10:39.319 align:start position:0%
it never exceeds the total employer
 
04:10:41.910 --> 04:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
contribution right um that's a safeguard
 
04:10:43.630 --> 04:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
to prevent this municipalities from not
 
04:10:47.469 --> 04:10:47.479 align:start position:0%
paying yeah and anyway that's well
 
04:10:50.910 --> 04:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
that's to make it fair because right now
 
04:10:53.229 --> 04:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
the employees are paying a large part of
 
04:10:55.790 --> 04:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
their retirement because
 
04:10:58.710 --> 04:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
of bad decisions that were made in the
 
04:11:01.030 --> 04:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
990s that
 
04:11:03.630 --> 04:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
um and so they're paying more than they
 
04:11:05.750 --> 04:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
ought to just for their pension and so
 
04:11:08.469 --> 04:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
are the employers the employers are
 
04:11:11.670 --> 04:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
paying a bigger share right now but that
 
04:11:13.510 --> 04:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
in only
 
04:11:16.590 --> 04:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
15 years or so the employees will catch
 
04:11:18.750 --> 04:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
up and they'll the employer rates will
 
04:11:20.950 --> 04:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
come down and and they'll be starting to
 
04:11:20.960 --> 04:11:25.149 align:start position:0%
come down and and they'll be starting to
pulla

04:11:25.149 --> 04:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:28.710 --> 04:11:28.720 align:start position:0%

04:11:43.590 --> 04:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
performance in recent years years we
 
04:11:45.670 --> 04:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
were able once again to reduce the
 
04:11:50.910 --> 04:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:53.670 --> 04:11:53.680 align:start position:0%

30 as discussed earlier both the board
 
04:12:09.070 --> 04:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
and our independent invest committee are
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries and are responsible for
 
04:12:13.710 --> 04:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
oversight of different areas

the board is approves the investment
 
04:12:18.670 --> 04:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
policy including asset allocation and

iic um was created by the legislature in
 
04:12:35.750 --> 04:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
2009 and the iic recommends investment
 
04:12:39.990 --> 04:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
policy to the board and the the iic is
 
04:12:42.510 --> 04:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for hiring and firing
 
04:12:45.910 --> 04:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
investment managers based on advice from

investment report which then gets
 
04:12:59.189 --> 04:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
approved by the board and I will now

[Music]
 
04:13:15.070 --> 04:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
investments thank you good afternoon
 
04:13:19.630 --> 04:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
everyone uh on slide 31 you'll see um an
 
04:13:21.670 --> 04:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
ass allocation of what's listed on on
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
our uh website and one thing that's um
 
04:13:26.469 --> 04:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
that you'll notice that's consistent
 
04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
with our discussion is really a move to
 
04:13:31.469 --> 04:13:31.479 align:start position:0%
make more increased transparency across
 
04:13:34.550 --> 04:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
the the plan uh we regularly meet with
 
04:13:36.429 --> 04:13:36.439 align:start position:0%
all of our investment managers every
 
04:13:39.389 --> 04:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
quarter and more so as needed to
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
determine if they're maintaining
 
04:13:43.269 --> 04:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
Fidelity to their investment um mandate
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
that we were hired we hired them for we
 
04:13:49.510 --> 04:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
take a long-term approach uh 25 years is
 
04:13:52.469 --> 04:13:52.479 align:start position:0%
Horizon some typically are 15 to 20
 
04:13:54.910 --> 04:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
years the 25 years is this ensures that
 
04:13:56.830 --> 04:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
we are thinking about the long-term
 
04:13:59.510 --> 04:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
outcomes uh for the pension plan and for
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
the beneficiaries and
 
04:14:04.510 --> 04:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
retirees we ma manage risk and liquidity
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's something that we always are
 
04:14:08.070 --> 04:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
thinking about and we try to and we
 
04:14:10.349 --> 04:14:10.359 align:start position:0%
strive to have a diversified portfolio
 
04:14:11.870 --> 04:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to achieve the investment
 
04:14:13.950 --> 04:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
income that that is meaning the benefit
 
04:14:16.109 --> 04:14:16.119 align:start position:0%
payments that Jan that ex executive
 
04:14:18.910 --> 04:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
director mentioned earlier uh what you
 
04:14:20.990 --> 04:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
see in a pie chart is a representa a
 
04:14:23.109 --> 04:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
representation of our Target where we
 
04:14:24.990 --> 04:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
want to be and what the actual
 
04:14:27.109 --> 04:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
allocation is obviously this is dated
 
04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
this is as of the last fiscal year um
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
but the numbers are very
 
04:14:33.830 --> 04:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
similar could I ask what the alternative
 
04:14:37.550 --> 04:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
Investments are yes
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%

04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
estate uh today um this new ass
 
04:15:02.030 --> 04:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
allocation I'll will go through uh that
 
04:15:05.790 --> 04:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
we made an update to uh last year uh
 
04:15:08.030 --> 04:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
incorporates uh infrastructure which is
 
04:15:10.590 --> 04:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
a new asset class for the portfol for
 
04:15:13.269 --> 04:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
the portfolio so the uh alternative
 
04:15:15.950 --> 04:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
would be all the major items private
 
04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
Equity private credit real estate and
 
04:15:20.469 --> 04:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
we'll include infrastructure in in the
 
04:15:20.479 --> 04:15:21.710 align:start position:0%
we'll include infrastructure in in the
near

04:15:21.710 --> 04:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
near
 
04:15:24.429 --> 04:15:24.439 align:start position:0%
future and I see sorry thank you I see
 
04:15:26.710 --> 04:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
real estate's also a separate one within
 
04:15:29.109 --> 04:15:29.119 align:start position:0%
here as well yes uh real estate
 
04:15:30.990 --> 04:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
allocation the reason why it's broken
 
04:15:34.030 --> 04:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
out is because we hire an advisor to
 
04:15:35.550 --> 04:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
manage the real estate portion of our
 
04:15:37.830 --> 04:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
portfolio that's towns and group and so
 
04:15:39.830 --> 04:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's what it's considered a manager but
 
04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
they have full discretion on the
 
04:15:44.750 --> 04:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
Investments there um that does not um
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
that goes through the iic and Board of
 
04:15:49.229 --> 04:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
Trustees uh but it's not does not come
 
04:15:50.710 --> 04:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
through the investment team thank you
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
I'll save the rest for later I spent too
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
much time on Wall Street to not have
 
04:15:56.109 --> 04:15:56.119 align:start position:0%
more questions okay but so that means
 
04:15:58.590 --> 04:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
that the alternative investments in the
 
04:16:01.670 --> 04:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
chart are the infrastructure private
 
04:16:04.389 --> 04:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
credit and uh private Equity that's
 
04:16:07.070 --> 04:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
correct thank you and so we'll we are um
 
04:16:10.349 --> 04:16:10.359 align:start position:0%
Madam chair we are moving to a more
 
04:16:12.910 --> 04:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
um a category that captures all the
 
04:16:14.590 --> 04:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
private investments in one section
 
04:16:17.309 --> 04:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
what's depicted here is how we um manage
 
04:16:17.319 --> 04:16:19.830 align:start position:0%
what's depicted here is how we um manage
the

04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:19.840 --> 04:16:24.910 align:start position:0%
 
assets

04:16:24.910 --> 04:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:33.149 --> 04:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
that's ah representative power thank you
 
04:16:34.389 --> 04:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:16:36.109 --> 04:16:36.119 align:start position:0%
question uh I was wondering if you could
 
04:16:38.870 --> 04:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
break down the non- US Equity a little
 
04:16:42.630 --> 04:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
bit non us Equity uh in the portfolio is
 
04:16:42.640 --> 04:16:43.550 align:start position:0%
bit non us Equity uh in the portfolio is
really

04:16:43.550 --> 04:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:16:45.750 --> 04:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh that's going to be combined right now
 
04:16:48.630 --> 04:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
it just means um Investments managers
 
04:16:50.429 --> 04:16:50.439 align:start position:0%
that we've hired to manage assets
 
04:16:52.990 --> 04:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
outside the US those managers tend to
 
04:16:55.670 --> 04:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
also allocate to the us as well so our
 
04:16:57.630 --> 04:16:57.640 align:start position:0%
in our new as allocation we're moving to
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
a global Equity structure where we can
 
04:17:01.510 --> 04:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that managers that do invest
 
04:17:03.950 --> 04:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
in the US and and non- us can exist in
 
04:17:04.870 --> 04:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
the same
 
04:17:07.710 --> 04:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
portfolio um and that that allocation is
 
04:17:07.720 --> 04:17:08.790 align:start position:0%
portfolio um and that that allocation is
around

04:17:08.790 --> 04:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
16% um today and we'll be around the
 
04:17:15.149 --> 04:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
same amount um in the New York Global
 
04:17:19.070 --> 04:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
Equity structure so you're saying that
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
the non- USX Equity also includes Global
 
04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
equity which includes some us yes
 
04:17:27.990 --> 04:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
typically the managers uh when they they
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
non us um typically have some
 
04:17:32.830 --> 04:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
investments in the US and so we want to
 
04:17:35.229 --> 04:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
reflect that better in in the portfolio
 
04:17:37.910 --> 04:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
by uh stating it as Global Equity
 
04:17:40.229 --> 04:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
whereas you have ability to do us non us
 
04:17:42.389 --> 04:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this chart is MI mixing
 
04:17:42.399 --> 04:17:43.670 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this chart is MI mixing
your

04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
investment managers with the actual
 
04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
Investments yeah when you look through
 
04:17:52.229 --> 04:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
it mam share to answer your question
 
04:17:53.950 --> 04:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
when you look through you you'll see we
 
04:17:55.469 --> 04:17:55.479 align:start position:0%
decompose it so that we can get better
 
04:17:57.189 --> 04:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
transparency as to what's happening
 
04:17:59.429 --> 04:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
there the managers do have that mandate
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
and that's typical for a lot of other
 
04:18:03.790 --> 04:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
plans and managers that they do have an
 
04:18:06.269 --> 04:18:06.279 align:start position:0%
the ability to invest in the US uh some
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
and others have ability to invest in
 
04:18:09.670 --> 04:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
emerging markets and so you can some
 
04:18:11.870 --> 04:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
people do break it out as us developed
 
04:18:14.030 --> 04:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
and emerging uh this is just a structure
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
that we've historically used U that
 
04:18:17.990 --> 04:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're are endeavoring to make more
 
04:18:18.000 --> 04:18:20.429 align:start position:0%
we're are endeavoring to make more
transparent

04:18:20.429 --> 04:18:20.439 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
04:18:23.870 --> 04:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
repres would it be fair to describe the
 
04:18:25.990 --> 04:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
various categories in the pie chart as
 
04:18:27.910 --> 04:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh strategies rather than assets and
 
04:18:29.830 --> 04:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
then their portion being an
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
asset allocated to that strategy um so
 
04:18:37.349 --> 04:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
that your target assets are are those
 
04:18:40.389 --> 04:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
goals uh or those uh the amount of
 
04:18:41.630 --> 04:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
dollars that are invested in each
 
04:18:44.149 --> 04:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
strategy and and are is the actual
 
04:18:45.910 --> 04:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative of the assets within each
 
04:18:47.189 --> 04:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
of those
 
04:18:50.670 --> 04:18:50.680 align:start position:0%
strategies U Madam chair rep uh members
 
04:18:55.389 --> 04:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
of um U committee um
 
04:18:58.870 --> 04:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative uh sloi
 
04:19:01.189 --> 04:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
SL guess is
 
04:19:04.670 --> 04:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
good uh to answer your question is you
 
04:19:06.870 --> 04:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
had a number of questions in there so
 
04:19:08.950 --> 04:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
the ultimate allocation is really
 
04:19:12.710 --> 04:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
looking to deor to give us the EXP
 
04:19:14.189 --> 04:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
exposure that we're looking for which is
 
04:19:16.269 --> 04:19:16.279 align:start position:0%
non us exposure or exposure to
 
04:19:19.950 --> 04:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
Investments outside the US uh so that is
 
04:19:21.469 --> 04:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
the Target that we're looking at and
 
04:19:23.189 --> 04:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
that's the Strategic ass allocation that
 
04:19:26.149 --> 04:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
you'll see referring to in in the in the
 
04:19:28.429 --> 04:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
in the subsequent slides here the
 
04:19:31.189 --> 04:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
managers that we hire and you're correct
 
04:19:33.630 --> 04:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
in and saying that they are strategies
 
04:19:35.149 --> 04:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
and so they go for either growth
 
04:19:39.870 --> 04:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
strategy or value strategy uh or um or
 
04:19:43.590 --> 04:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
um small cap or large cap and that you
 
04:19:45.670 --> 04:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
know typically represents the larger
 
04:19:47.070 --> 04:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
companies in economy or smaller
 
04:19:49.149 --> 04:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
companies in the economy so they all are
 
04:19:51.309 --> 04:19:51.319 align:start position:0%
within this this pie chart that we try
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
to employ and we try to structure that
 
04:19:56.550 --> 04:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
in a diversified manner to be able to uh
 
04:19:59.469 --> 04:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
to um spread out the risk to not be
 
04:20:01.269 --> 04:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
concentrated in any one area or another
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
so you're absolutely right that these
 
04:20:05.349 --> 04:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
are strategies that we try to employ but
 
04:20:06.950 --> 04:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
this is a very crude way of trying to
 
04:20:08.349 --> 04:20:08.359 align:start position:0%
capture that because it doesn't really
 
04:20:10.790 --> 04:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
detail that but on our website we do
 
04:20:13.469 --> 04:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
have uh the ability you have the ability
 
04:20:15.469 --> 04:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
today to go through and look at okay
 
04:20:17.469 --> 04:20:17.479 align:start position:0%
private Equity or private credit and see
 
04:20:18.830 --> 04:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
the managers that are in there to be
 
04:20:20.950 --> 04:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
able to denote the strategies and even
 
04:20:22.630 --> 04:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
bucket what strategies are they are they
 
04:20:25.309 --> 04:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
grow are they buyout growth capital and
 
04:20:28.670 --> 04:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:32.429 --> 04:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
onch are these charts act the actual
 
04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
distribution I don't know what the word
 
04:20:33.840 --> 04:20:35.269 align:start position:0%
distribution I don't know what the word
strategy

04:20:35.269 --> 04:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
04:20:37.750 --> 04:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
means I I when I looked at this
 
04:20:40.389 --> 04:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
initially I thought this is how our how
 
04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
our assets are how your assets asss our
 
04:20:45.670 --> 04:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
assets are divided now you've introduced
 
04:20:47.309 --> 04:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
this word strategy and I don't know what
 
04:20:50.710 --> 04:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
that means Madam chair representatives
 
04:20:54.990 --> 04:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee just just go the so yes
 
04:20:56.710 --> 04:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
that what you're not seeing here is the
 
04:20:58.469 --> 04:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
strategies that that so you're seeing
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
just the top level which is how we um
 
04:21:04.349 --> 04:21:04.359 align:start position:0%
allocate the Investments between us or
 
04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
domestic Equity non- us Equity fixed
 
04:21:09.870 --> 04:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
income and so beneath that there are
 
04:21:11.830 --> 04:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
individual strategies for each one of
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:21.309 --> 04:21:21.319 align:start position:0%
invested I I think after the general
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
presentation we'll let let the uh
 
04:21:27.149 --> 04:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
economists go off on a separate uh
 
04:21:29.550 --> 04:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
separate side meeting sounds like a
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative dery yeah um
 
04:21:35.830 --> 04:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
roughly what percent of your assets are
 
04:21:38.790 --> 04:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
in cash or liquid Investments that's
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
they're kind of buried in each one of
 
04:21:42.109 --> 04:21:42.119 align:start position:0%
these categories but would you say you
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
have AAR large amount of cash or a small
 
04:21:46.389 --> 04:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
amount of cash or can you comment on
 
04:21:49.109 --> 04:21:49.119 align:start position:0%
that Madam chair representatives of the
 
04:21:52.109 --> 04:21:52.119 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative dery uh yes
 
04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
so in this Char we don't do not cash
 
04:21:56.349 --> 04:21:56.359 align:start position:0%
where we try to keep cash as low as
 
04:21:58.670 --> 04:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
possible our Target allocation for cash
 
04:22:01.710 --> 04:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
is is 0% uh but we keep cash on
 
04:22:04.269 --> 04:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
liquidity for Capital calls so it varies
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
between 1 and 2% historically and so
 
04:22:09.269 --> 04:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
that's the amount of cash that we keep
 
04:22:11.910 --> 04:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
but we we try to keep the target zero so
 
04:22:14.189 --> 04:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
we try to keep the the money invested
 
04:22:16.670 --> 04:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
followup followup so do you rely on the
 
04:22:18.189 --> 04:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
investment adviser to decide like
 
04:22:19.510 --> 04:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
suppose someone is thinking that there's
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
going to be a market correction and they
 
04:22:23.710 --> 04:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
say let's dump some stocks and sorry put
 
04:22:26.830 --> 04:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
it into cash and then buy again later or
 
04:22:29.910 --> 04:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
do you just say let's just own stuff and
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
write it
 
04:22:34.670 --> 04:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
out that's a great question uh what we
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
typically do is we work with our
 
04:22:38.109 --> 04:22:38.119 align:start position:0%
investment consultant to understand
 
04:22:39.790 --> 04:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the macroeconomic
 
04:22:41.950 --> 04:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
environment so for in in this case of
 
04:22:41.960 --> 04:22:43.070 align:start position:0%
environment so for in in this case of
202

04:22:43.070 --> 04:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
202
 
04:22:45.590 --> 04:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
when we had uh the covid and the mark
 
04:22:48.389 --> 04:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
and the market tanked dramatically a lot
 
04:22:50.870 --> 04:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
of uh portfolios a lot of people didn't
 
04:22:53.670 --> 04:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to sell uh a lot of
 
04:22:55.990 --> 04:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
assets were distressed and and were
 
04:22:58.070 --> 04:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
impaired so what happened is that
 
04:23:00.550 --> 04:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
pattern came back and it it went back up
 
04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
and so you'll see a sharp rise in
 
04:23:06.269 --> 04:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
performance in for 2020 and 2021 so we
 
04:23:07.710 --> 04:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
typically work with our investment
 
04:23:09.269 --> 04:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
advisor we work with the committee and
 
04:23:10.870 --> 04:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
the team does the work to be able to
 
04:23:14.030 --> 04:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
assess what should we do to protect uh
 
04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
the assets at the if if there's
 
04:23:18.510 --> 04:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
something happening in the macroeconomic
 
04:23:22.830 --> 04:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
environment um for the most part it's a
 
04:23:24.910 --> 04:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
it's a long-term decision it's not a
 
04:23:27.229 --> 04:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
short-term decision and so we really are
 
04:23:28.910 --> 04:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
very deliberate and thoughtful about
 
04:23:30.670 --> 04:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
what do we want to do in those
 
04:23:32.550 --> 04:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
particular scenarios but we do
 
04:23:34.750 --> 04:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
incorporate the the work that we need to
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
do uh we do um discuss that with the
 
04:23:40.950 --> 04:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
with the board and with the iic and and
 
04:23:43.309 --> 04:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
secure their advice and make a
 
04:23:45.630 --> 04:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
thoughtful recommendation for
 
04:23:48.510 --> 04:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
action and the contributions from
 
04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
employers come in regularly throughout
 
04:23:54.189 --> 04:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
the year and the pension payments are
 
04:23:56.469 --> 04:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
regular throughout the year so that
 
04:24:01.510 --> 04:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:04.109 --> 04:24:04.119 align:start position:0%
cash what I what I can say Madam chair
 
04:24:06.429 --> 04:24:06.439 align:start position:0%
is that it we are long-term investors
 
04:24:09.710 --> 04:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
and so we we are projecting for the 25y
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
year Horizon so there there is
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
volatility in the market and we're
 
04:24:15.229 --> 04:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
always conscious of that but we really
 
04:24:17.590 --> 04:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
strive to make thoughtful decisions to
 
04:24:19.950 --> 04:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
generate the outcomes in the 25e period
 
04:24:19.960 --> 04:24:24.469 align:start position:0%
generate the outcomes in the 25e period
in

04:24:24.469 --> 04:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:28.149 --> 04:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
perpetuity the next slide on on slide
 
04:24:31.550 --> 04:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
32 uh details our investment returns for
 
04:24:36.030 --> 04:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
the 1 three five 10 and 25 year periods
 
04:24:37.790 --> 04:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh what you'll notice that the returns
 
04:24:40.030 --> 04:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
are very strong across those time
 
04:24:42.910 --> 04:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
Horizons across volatility in the market
 
04:24:45.389 --> 04:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
uh has has been a bumpy ride uh for the
 
04:24:48.750 --> 04:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
last 10 15 years uh but we are uh
 
04:24:52.030 --> 04:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
focused on um the assumed rate of return
 
04:24:54.630 --> 04:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
which is six and 3/4 and all of these
 
04:24:57.070 --> 04:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
are net of fee returns so we are
 
04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
regenerating fees I generate returns net
 
04:25:02.790 --> 04:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:07.830 --> 04:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
matters the next slide on slide 33 uh is
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
a Time series of our rated returns and
 
04:25:12.910 --> 04:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
so the intuition here for this slide is
 
04:25:15.030 --> 04:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
the blue bars that are above the line
 
04:25:16.910 --> 04:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
and so the other goal of having a
 
04:25:19.269 --> 04:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
diverse portfolio is to strive for
 
04:25:22.269 --> 04:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
consistency in returns and outcomes and
 
04:25:24.389 --> 04:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
so it's not a you're not going to win
 
04:25:27.309 --> 04:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
all the time uh there are issues in 2012
 
04:25:31.030 --> 04:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
2015 and 16 if you remember back then uh
 
04:25:33.950 --> 04:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
in 2012 we had the de sealing debate uh
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
the US um s PO is downgraded our
 
04:25:39.750 --> 04:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
treasury debt from AAA to Able a and so
 
04:25:42.429 --> 04:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
that uh was a a time of of turmoil in
 
04:25:45.109 --> 04:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
the market uh Greece and and Spain were
 
04:25:47.070 --> 04:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
going through issues and at that time
 
04:25:49.510 --> 04:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
Greece was going to be um was close to
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
leaving the EU so that is the reason
 
04:25:55.550 --> 04:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
there uh other 2014 2015 are low yield
 
04:25:57.349 --> 04:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
environments and if remember that there
 
04:26:01.149 --> 04:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
were negative rates uh in in the in um
 
04:26:04.109 --> 04:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
for Germany and swiss deposits uh slow
 
04:26:06.790 --> 04:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
down in global growth and so there are
 
04:26:08.309 --> 04:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
periods where it's it's been very
 
04:26:11.109 --> 04:26:11.119 align:start position:0%
volatile but overall the consistency and
 
04:26:13.189 --> 04:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
and the shape of this is that the the
 
04:26:15.149 --> 04:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
the the fiveyear smoothing is above the
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
line which is what we're striving to do
 
04:26:21.790 --> 04:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:25.510 --> 04:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
outcomes next slide on slide 34 just uh
 
04:26:28.189 --> 04:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
looks at some of the performance uh that
 
04:26:30.429 --> 04:26:30.439 align:start position:0%
uh relative to our peers as we look at
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
other plans and how they're allocated
 
04:26:34.790 --> 04:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
and happy to report that that
 
04:26:38.189 --> 04:26:38.199 align:start position:0%
performance is very strong uh during 15E
 
04:26:40.630 --> 04:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
period investment made decisions they we
 
04:26:44.309 --> 04:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
out the the IC performed 8 84% of the
 
04:26:46.469 --> 04:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
peers that we measure ourselves and this
 
04:26:49.109 --> 04:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
data comes from our consultant Kalen our
 
04:26:50.590 --> 04:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
investment consultant who is our general
 
04:26:54.070 --> 04:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
consultant for the plan um and uh the
 
04:26:57.550 --> 04:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
the the peers are all large uh public
 
04:27:01.149 --> 04:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
funds uh and Define benefit plans so
 
04:27:04.269 --> 04:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
quite strong uh
 
04:27:07.309 --> 04:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
performance last uh last slide I'll walk
 
04:27:09.750 --> 04:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
you through is slide 35 and some of the
 
04:27:12.750 --> 04:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
work since I've joined the plan in 20
 
04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
two years ago um Maria um our Chief
 
04:27:19.429 --> 04:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
Financial offer service has spoken about
 
04:27:21.309 --> 04:27:21.319 align:start position:0%
is improving the transparency and that's
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
something that's very very important uh
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
we are disclosing more information now
 
04:27:27.389 --> 04:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
and nhrs has historically disclosed a
 
04:27:29.349 --> 04:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
lot of information about the plan the
 
04:27:30.910 --> 04:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
Investments and so we're continuing to
 
04:27:33.790 --> 04:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
do that even more uh we want to also be
 
04:27:36.550 --> 04:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
able to see the fees that the managers
 
04:27:38.429 --> 04:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
are charging and so we want to be able
 
04:27:40.710 --> 04:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
to to see what those are and disclose
 
04:27:42.830 --> 04:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
that we also want a benchmark ourselves
 
04:27:45.070 --> 04:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
against other plans and and make that uh
 
04:27:45.080 --> 04:27:46.189 align:start position:0%
against other plans and and make that uh
information

04:27:46.189 --> 04:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:27:49.149 --> 04:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
available um our executive director
 
04:27:50.590 --> 04:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
talked about the Strategic asset
 
04:27:53.229 --> 04:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
allocation that we just updated and so
 
04:27:55.550 --> 04:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
we proposed the the addition of uh
 
04:27:58.309 --> 04:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and private credit and so
 
04:27:59.830 --> 04:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
those are two strategies We Believe will
 
04:28:02.750 --> 04:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
be accretive to uh uh the portfolio
 
04:28:04.750 --> 04:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
going forward it also allows us to
 
04:28:07.910 --> 04:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
reduce the risk uh um overall we'll
 
04:28:10.950 --> 04:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
still have exposure to to Global Equity
 
04:28:14.750 --> 04:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
but we want to move uh assets from uh
 
04:28:16.590 --> 04:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
Global Equity into infrastructure and
 
04:28:18.109 --> 04:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
private credit which we think we believe
 
04:28:19.630 --> 04:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
will generate strong
 
04:28:23.109 --> 04:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
outcomes uh I ALS I we also developed a
 
04:28:24.590 --> 04:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
fiveyear strategic plan for the
 
04:28:26.429 --> 04:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
investment office that calls for the
 
04:28:28.830 --> 04:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
recruit Rec uh recruiting and retention
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
of investment Talent which is incredibly
 
04:28:33.469 --> 04:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
important for the work that we do um
 
04:28:35.590 --> 04:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
investing in systems to be able to do
 
04:28:37.630 --> 04:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
the analysis that's also something
 
04:28:38.910 --> 04:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to be very important for us
 
04:28:41.830 --> 04:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
to do is to is to make that investment
 
04:28:45.550 --> 04:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
uh and also um transparency is the last
 
04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
bit bit I've already talked about and so
 
04:28:50.510 --> 04:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
we have already adopted um disclosing
 
04:28:53.030 --> 04:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
our proxy voting summary on our website
 
04:28:55.030 --> 04:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
the materials for all the meetings are
 
04:28:58.389 --> 04:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
on our website uh and also a dashboard
 
04:29:00.630 --> 04:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
that can disclose uh all of the
 
04:29:03.149 --> 04:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
Investments that we've that we've made
 
04:29:04.950 --> 04:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
is also available on the website and it
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
will be there every quarter going
 
04:29:09.590 --> 04:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
forward so we're very proud of those
 
04:29:12.109 --> 04:29:12.119 align:start position:0%
those um of that action we'll continue
 
04:29:14.510 --> 04:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
to do more of that going
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
forward and with that I yield back to
 
04:29:18.109 --> 04:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
our executive
 
04:29:21.510 --> 04:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
director thank you very much Mr LC I'm
 
04:29:24.750 --> 04:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
now on page 36 of the presentation the
 
04:29:26.950 --> 04:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
Actuarial rate of return is one of the
 
04:29:29.189 --> 04:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
most consequential decisions that the
 
04:29:33.510 --> 04:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
board makes this R ratio rate is used to
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
calculate the unfunded liability and
 
04:29:38.510 --> 04:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
effects the employer contribution rate
 
04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
and let me just tell you a little bit
 
04:29:42.269 --> 04:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
about how we arrive at this rate our our
 
04:29:44.429 --> 04:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
actuary makes a recommendation to the
 
04:29:47.590 --> 04:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
board based on a survey that the actuary
 
04:29:50.429 --> 04:29:50.439 align:start position:0%
has done of investment Consultants to
 
04:29:52.990 --> 04:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
determine the expected rates of returns
 
04:29:55.030 --> 04:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
for the different asset classes that
 
04:29:58.349 --> 04:29:58.359 align:start position:0%
nhrs owns and then based on the weight
 
04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
of that asset class we come up with a
 
04:30:02.790 --> 04:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
weighted average for what the
 
04:30:05.309 --> 04:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
overall assumed rate of return should be
 
04:30:07.830 --> 04:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
for the entire
 
04:30:10.590 --> 04:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
portfolio and this is looked at every
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
year briefly when the actuary does the
 
04:30:15.309 --> 04:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
valuation and is given a very thorough
 
04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
examination every four years as part of
 
04:30:20.030 --> 04:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
the experience study and as I noted
 
04:30:22.550 --> 04:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
earlier the most recent experien study
 
04:30:25.109 --> 04:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
did not result in any recommended change
 
04:30:28.830 --> 04:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
to the assumed rate of return this chart
 
04:30:31.510 --> 04:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
shows how what
 
04:30:33.990 --> 04:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
our assumed rate of return has been
 
04:30:35.990 --> 04:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
those are the green numbers you can see
 
04:30:39.149 --> 04:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
back in 2004 we were at 9% so that was
 
04:30:41.990 --> 04:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
coming out of the Roaring 90ss um and
 
04:30:46.109 --> 04:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
over time that has slid down to
 
04:30:49.149 --> 04:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
6.75% and you can see from the early
 
04:30:52.910 --> 04:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
years from 2004 through 2010 our returns
 
04:30:55.309 --> 04:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
were more aggressive than those of most
 
04:30:57.790 --> 04:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
other public pension plans and since
 
04:31:00.990 --> 04:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
then we've been a aiming at more on the
 
04:31:03.429 --> 04:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
conservative side conservative yet
 
04:31:06.550 --> 04:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
realistic um it's very difficult to
 
04:31:09.109 --> 04:31:09.119 align:start position:0%
compare the two rates of returns of any
 
04:31:11.910 --> 04:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
two pension plans because it all depends
 
04:31:13.830 --> 04:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
depends on the what the plan's
 
04:31:16.750 --> 04:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
underlying assets are so if two plans
 
04:31:18.830 --> 04:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
have different asset allocations they
 
04:31:22.830 --> 04:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
will have different assumed rates of
 
04:31:25.710 --> 04:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
return page
 
04:31:30.269 --> 04:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
37 as we mentioned earlier um 2024 was
 
04:31:32.910 --> 04:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
um another busy session with 14 bills
 
04:31:34.910 --> 04:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
introduced and three that were enacted
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
into law one was a um a temporary
 
04:31:40.670 --> 04:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
supplemental allowance there was the
 
04:31:43.710 --> 04:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
violent acts the disability benefit and
 
04:31:48.109 --> 04:31:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:52.229 --> 04:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
multiplier page 38 this slide summarizes
 
04:31:56.070 --> 04:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
nhs's role Visa the legislature um we
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
are here to provide data and objective
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
analysis we do that through a variety of
 
04:32:04.510 --> 04:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
media one is the fiscal note worksheets
 
04:32:07.030 --> 04:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
the bill briefs that we prepare
 
04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
afternoons like this afternoon when we
 
04:32:11.590 --> 04:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
provide testimony or education and we
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
also to provide you with a great deal of
 
04:32:16.710 --> 04:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
informational material our annual
 
04:32:18.830 --> 04:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
comprehensive financial report the
 
04:32:20.670 --> 04:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
actuary evaluations and the
 
04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive annual investment
 
04:32:27.990 --> 04:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
report page 39 to summarize everything
 
04:32:31.070 --> 04:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
that we've covered this afternoon NRA
 
04:32:33.469 --> 04:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
nhrs does provide a modest pension
 
04:32:36.550 --> 04:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
benefit we have a plan in place to pay
 
04:32:38.229 --> 04:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
down the unfunded
 
04:32:40.510 --> 04:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
liability and I'll have more detail for
 
04:32:42.870 --> 04:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
you on that in two slides
 
04:32:44.950 --> 04:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
and the board has taken many responsible
 
04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
steps to assure proper plan
 
04:32:54.269 --> 04:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
funding page 40 is a comparison of our
 
04:32:56.590 --> 04:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
funded ratio relative to that of our
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
peers as I mentioned earlier the funded
 
04:33:02.349 --> 04:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
ratio is the Actuarial value of assets
 
04:33:04.990 --> 04:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
that's the fiveyear smooth assets
 
04:33:08.429 --> 04:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
divided by the Actuarial acred liability
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
which is the present value of all of the
 
04:33:13.949 --> 04:33:13.959 align:start position:0%
liabilities that our members have earned
 
04:33:16.510 --> 04:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
the road to 100% funding is rarely
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
smooth but we are on the right path and
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
continue to make good
 
04:33:23.551 --> 04:33:23.561 align:start position:0%
progress and it you can see by looking
 
04:33:25.750 --> 04:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
at this chart every time that we
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
decreased our Actuarial rate of return
 
04:33:31.150 --> 04:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
the funded ratio decreased and the
 
04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability increased so you can
 
04:33:36.349 --> 04:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
see that in years um
 
04:33:42.990 --> 04:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:43.000 --> 04:33:45.670 align:start position:0%
 
page

04:33:45.670 --> 04:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:50.670 --> 04:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
41 this is the projection of where our
 
04:33:54.230 --> 04:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
actuaries expect us to be over the next
 
04:33:54.240 --> 04:33:55.429 align:start position:0%
actuaries expect us to be over the next
20

04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
20
 
04:33:59.789 --> 04:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
years um on paying down the amortization
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
of our unfunded
 
04:34:04.590 --> 04:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
liability so the green the apple green
 
04:34:07.629 --> 04:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
line reflects the unfunded liability at
 
04:34:10.429 --> 04:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
different times in the future today it
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
is 5.6 billion million dollar the
 
04:34:15.789 --> 04:34:15.799 align:start position:0%
individual bars on the bar chart are are
 
04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
comprised of the initial unfunded
 
04:34:23.070 --> 04:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
liability from 2010 that's what the teal
 
04:34:25.830 --> 04:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
is and then the other gains and losses
 
04:34:28.429 --> 04:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
that are being amortised over 20-year
 
04:34:32.070 --> 04:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
periods that were incurred after
 
04:34:34.590 --> 04:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
2017 as you can see some of these
 
04:34:38.230 --> 04:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
periods have gains such as 2021 and the
 
04:34:40.910 --> 04:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
changes arising from the 23 experience
 
04:34:44.990 --> 04:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
study and those are below the line and
 
04:34:48.310 --> 04:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
those positive gains reduce the overall
 
04:34:51.230 --> 04:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability but you can see that
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
we are very much on the path to
 
04:34:56.990 --> 04:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
amortising our unfunded liability there
 
04:34:59.189 --> 04:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
is a plan in place and we continue to
 
04:35:02.750 --> 04:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.910 --> 04:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
it yes and
 
04:35:08.349 --> 04:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
the accumulated liability
 
04:35:12.109 --> 04:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
from uh pre 2011 is still the biggest
 
04:35:16.189 --> 04:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
part of our deficit yes Madam chair it
 
04:35:19.310 --> 04:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
is but it is
 
04:35:21.670 --> 04:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
decreasing because we are at the point
 
04:35:24.269 --> 04:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
now that we have paid off enough that
 
04:35:26.150 --> 04:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
each before we
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
were in a place that the interest on the
 
04:35:33.750 --> 04:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability each year was so high
 
04:35:35.789 --> 04:35:35.799 align:start position:0%
that our unfunded liability kept
 
04:35:38.269 --> 04:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
increasing but now we have turned the
 
04:35:41.269 --> 04:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
corner and the unfunded liability is now
 
04:35:43.709 --> 04:35:43.719 align:start position:0%
decreas increasing each
 
04:35:47.670 --> 04:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
year page 42 I my apologies to those of
 
04:35:49.310 --> 04:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
you on the committee who've seen this
 
04:35:51.349 --> 04:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
chart before but I think it's a great
 
04:35:53.869 --> 04:35:53.879 align:start position:0%
story New Hampshire is not the only
 
04:35:55.551 --> 04:35:55.561 align:start position:0%
state that's working on reducing its
 
04:35:58.230 --> 04:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability our neighbor to the
 
04:36:01.070 --> 04:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
East Maine began their efforts on this
 
04:36:03.429 --> 04:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
important Endeavor back in
 
04:36:06.750 --> 04:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
1997 as a very good comparison as our
 
04:36:08.629 --> 04:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
plans as you can see have many
 
04:36:11.551 --> 04:36:11.561 align:start position:0%
characteristics in common similar part
 
04:36:13.310 --> 04:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
participants number of active members
 
04:36:16.470 --> 04:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
and retirees and interestingly both
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%
states have similar constitutional
 
04:36:21.910 --> 04:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions um what's especially
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
heartening is that you can see that
 
04:36:26.670 --> 04:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
Maine when they started this in 1996
 
04:36:29.390 --> 04:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
their funded ratio was
 
04:36:32.789 --> 04:36:32.799 align:start position:0%
51% whereas when we started in fy10 it
 
04:36:32.799 --> 04:36:34.029 align:start position:0%
51% whereas when we started in fy10 it
was

04:36:34.029 --> 04:36:34.039 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:36:38.230 --> 04:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
57.4% in Maine now is at
 
04:36:41.709 --> 04:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
86.3% and we're at 68%
 
04:36:43.750 --> 04:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
so they got a good head start on us but
 
04:36:46.910 --> 04:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:50.789 --> 04:36:50.799 align:start position:0%
progress page 43 um is the last page of
 
04:36:54.629 --> 04:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
the summary um New Hampshire is very
 
04:36:57.230 --> 04:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have strong constitutional
 
04:37:00.510 --> 04:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
and statutory protections to protect our
 
04:37:02.869 --> 04:37:02.879 align:start position:0%
financial future of the retirement
 
04:37:06.150 --> 04:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
system and as you saw from the prior
 
04:37:08.750 --> 04:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
chart this is a marathon it's not a
 
04:37:11.269 --> 04:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
Sprint and there are no shortcuts it's
 
04:37:11.279 --> 04:37:12.429 align:start position:0%
Sprint and there are no shortcuts it's
steady

04:37:12.429 --> 04:37:12.439 align:start position:0%
steady
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
progress and we are determined to stay
 
04:37:17.949 --> 04:37:17.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:20.349 --> 04:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
course at that point I'd be happy to
 
04:37:22.709 --> 04:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
04:37:25.910 --> 04:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
questions I'm sorry we have some
 
04:37:28.470 --> 04:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
appendices with different background
 
04:37:34.150 --> 04:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:36.590 --> 04:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
like yes and we
 
04:37:39.990 --> 04:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
have um I think it's four pension
 
04:37:42.310 --> 04:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
related bills this year so far there's
 
04:37:44.629 --> 04:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
still more coming uh we'll be hearing
 
04:37:48.349 --> 04:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
one next week that's the
 
04:37:51.990 --> 04:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
um U unemployment compensation limit and
 
04:37:56.869 --> 04:37:56.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:59.869 --> 04:37:59.879 align:start position:0%
next Howard thank you madam chair and
 
04:38:00.990 --> 04:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I
 
04:38:03.390 --> 04:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh look at the appendix uh
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
page 48 uh looking at active members
 
04:38:08.349 --> 04:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
versus uh
 
04:38:11.551 --> 04:38:11.561 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries so since 2015 it looks
 
04:38:13.109 --> 04:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
like the active membership has not
 
04:38:17.230 --> 04:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
really changed uh at all versus uh 2015
 
04:38:19.269 --> 04:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
the active beneficiaries has increased
 
04:38:20.230 --> 04:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
by like
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
15,000 uh do you have any concerns as to
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
being able to fund things in the future
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh as we're not necessarily seeing any
 
04:38:29.551 --> 04:38:29.561 align:start position:0%
change in our active membership thank
 
04:38:32.189 --> 04:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
you um Madam chair members of the
 
04:38:34.269 --> 04:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
committee representative Howard um this
 
04:38:37.070 --> 04:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
is very normal for a pension plan and uh
 
04:38:40.590 --> 04:38:40.600 align:start position:0%
we do regular cash flow projections
 
04:38:43.230 --> 04:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
going out many years um our actuaries do
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
this every year and we foresee no future
 
04:38:48.990 --> 04:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
problems with
 
04:38:51.910 --> 04:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
04:38:54.949 --> 04:38:54.959 align:start position:0%
you yes and unfortunately our or
 
04:38:56.869 --> 04:38:56.879 align:start position:0%
fortunately the retirees are living
 
04:38:59.349 --> 04:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
longer than they we originally thought
 
04:39:01.230 --> 04:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
they would so there's we keep
 
04:39:15.789 --> 04:39:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:18.310 --> 04:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
yes Madam chair I'll jump in since we're
 
04:39:21.390 --> 04:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
all gonna you know sit in silence here
 
04:39:24.470 --> 04:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
um your
 
04:39:27.990 --> 04:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
predecessor and I have went a couple of
 
04:39:33.429 --> 04:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
rounds because in the investment report
 
04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
the detailed one that came out we we
 
04:39:37.910 --> 04:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
were investing in
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
categories that were not yielding for
 
04:39:42.560 --> 04:39:44.550 align:start position:0%
categories that were not yielding for
4%

04:39:44.550 --> 04:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
4%
 
04:39:47.110 --> 04:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
and and we were doing this continuously
 
04:39:50.030 --> 04:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
with a target of 6 and 3/4 or
 
04:39:51.830 --> 04:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
realistically more like
 
04:39:51.840 --> 04:39:53.788 align:start position:0%
realistically more like
seven

04:39:53.788 --> 04:39:53.798 align:start position:0%
seven
 
04:39:57.150 --> 04:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
um with you now taking the helm are we
 
04:39:59.868 --> 04:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
is the and I say we as a member of the
 
04:40:02.830 --> 04:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system
 
04:40:06.590 --> 04:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
um looking at getting out of those
 
04:40:09.430 --> 04:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
investment categories that seem to never
 
04:40:11.910 --> 04:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
ever make the Ben
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
Benchmark and I understand you know I I
 
04:40:17.110 --> 04:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the word diversity in
 
04:40:19.830 --> 04:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
Investments okay I I don't really hold I
 
04:40:23.070 --> 04:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
think a lot of that is a cop out
 
04:40:26.510 --> 04:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
um there's you know the the system seems
 
04:40:27.948 --> 04:40:27.958 align:start position:0%
to have a Target right I mean you guys
 
04:40:31.670 --> 04:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
have this is where we got to be and when
 
04:40:34.830 --> 04:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
you're invested in things that never
 
04:40:37.350 --> 04:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
ever ever make the
 
04:40:40.270 --> 04:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
target why would you do that so with you
 
04:40:43.230 --> 04:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
taking the helm in that regard now I'm
 
04:40:46.030 --> 04:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
just curious as to your philosophy is to
 
04:40:50.390 --> 04:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
is to um diversification of investment
 
04:40:55.750 --> 04:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:58.910 --> 04:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
target Madam chair members of the
 
04:41:02.110 --> 04:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
committee and representative
 
04:41:04.910 --> 04:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
Pearson I think I got that right maybe
 
04:41:07.390 --> 04:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
um working on it um it's it's a great
 
04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
question so so the one of the reasons
 
04:41:12.350 --> 04:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
the philosophy around having um
 
04:41:14.590 --> 04:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
Investments that may not yield the
 
04:41:18.150 --> 04:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
target is that is for diversification so
 
04:41:20.310 --> 04:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
when and and that is it's not a
 
04:41:23.550 --> 04:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
satisfactory answer but it's it's it's
 
04:41:25.788 --> 04:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why you would have
 
04:41:28.350 --> 04:41:28.360 align:start position:0%
investments in a portfolio that may not
 
04:41:30.150 --> 04:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
yield because not everything's going to
 
04:41:32.110 --> 04:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
be up at the same time and so if you're
 
04:41:34.230 --> 04:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
taking a 25y year Horizon you're going
 
04:41:35.110 --> 04:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
to have things that are going to be up
 
04:41:36.550 --> 04:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
or down at different times and that's
 
04:41:38.430 --> 04:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
why you want the pockets of investments
 
04:41:41.510 --> 04:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
in different places and so the answer
 
04:41:45.230 --> 04:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
for nhrs is that there are investments
 
04:41:47.510 --> 04:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
that um that have been made that may not
 
04:41:50.150 --> 04:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
have worked out in the past for example
 
04:41:52.670 --> 04:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
energy if you if we had a lot of energy
 
04:41:55.190 --> 04:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
in our portfolio and in the time that
 
04:41:59.550 --> 04:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
you saw in the 200 uh uh 145 energy was
 
04:42:02.830 --> 04:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
taking a big bath and so those
 
04:42:04.590 --> 04:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
Investments may not have panned out as
 
04:42:06.868 --> 04:42:06.878 align:start position:0%
we expected and so then you look at the
 
04:42:08.948 --> 04:42:08.958 align:start position:0%
returns you you see that there are some
 
04:42:10.430 --> 04:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
you know it didn't make the target of 10
 
04:42:13.470 --> 04:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
to 12% or low teens or even high single
 
04:42:16.110 --> 04:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
digits and and low teens and so those
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
Investments tend to be in private uh
 
04:42:20.910 --> 04:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
markets and will eventually come out of
 
04:42:23.590 --> 04:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
the portfolio after 10 12 years and so
 
04:42:25.510 --> 04:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
what we're doing now is to put in
 
04:42:28.190 --> 04:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
Investments that will generate a high
 
04:42:29.868 --> 04:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
yield and so I talked about
 
04:42:31.750 --> 04:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and so our infrastructure
 
04:42:33.788 --> 04:42:33.798 align:start position:0%
approach is to do infrastructure that's
 
04:42:35.910 --> 04:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
going to be a cash yielding investment
 
04:42:38.750 --> 04:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
so it's low risk core infrastructure not
 
04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
value adding opportunistic we're not
 
04:42:42.310 --> 04:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
building new data centers but we are
 
04:42:44.030 --> 04:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
invested in in assets that are going to
 
04:42:46.670 --> 04:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
have a higher yield Road and today
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
environment the yield you know yields
 
04:42:52.470 --> 04:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
are are high and back in 10 10 years ago
 
04:42:54.070 --> 04:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
maybe five to 10 years ago yields were
 
04:42:56.190 --> 04:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
very low and so by the nature of being
 
04:42:58.470 --> 04:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
in the market you're going to invest in
 
04:43:00.350 --> 04:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
in assets that are not going to generate
 
04:43:02.910 --> 04:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
a high yield and so what investors
 
04:43:04.550 --> 04:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
typically do is they invest they use
 
04:43:07.230 --> 04:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
leverage and My Philosophy is I I don't
 
04:43:09.310 --> 04:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
like to use leverage um I don't believe
 
04:43:11.590 --> 04:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
that it's needed um and I think that
 
04:43:13.470 --> 04:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
adds another dimension of risk that that
 
04:43:15.270 --> 04:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
is not appropriate for a plant of our
 
04:43:18.030 --> 04:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
size but I do want to diversify amongst
 
04:43:22.030 --> 04:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
um equities bonds credit infrastructure
 
04:43:24.030 --> 04:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
real estate I think those are the way to
 
04:43:26.310 --> 04:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
build a diversified portfolio and there
 
04:43:28.030 --> 04:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be times where invest there
 
04:43:29.430 --> 04:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
are yields that are going to be that're
 
04:43:31.868 --> 04:43:31.878 align:start position:0%
not going to make the hurdle but when
 
04:43:33.628 --> 04:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
you put the whole thing together it
 
04:43:36.070 --> 04:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
should be Diversified and it should
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
yield the the target of six and 3/4 or
 
04:43:40.310 --> 04:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
at least better than that because we're
 
04:43:42.390 --> 04:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
not just trying to get that number we
 
04:43:44.868 --> 04:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
want to get that number plus the skill
 
04:43:46.788 --> 04:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
that we're applying to by hiring the
 
04:43:49.030 --> 04:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
managers with skill by doing the work in
 
04:43:51.030 --> 04:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
the investment and investment um
 
04:43:52.708 --> 04:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
allocations and working with the
 
04:43:54.830 --> 04:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
committee to do that so it's not just
 
04:43:56.070 --> 04:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
the six and three quars we want to try
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
to do better than that to be able to to
 
04:43:59.350 --> 04:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
be able to pay out the benef the
 
04:44:02.070 --> 04:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
benefits I don't know I hope that
 
04:44:05.470 --> 04:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
satisfies your answers your question oh
 
04:44:07.788 --> 04:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
you answered the satisfaction part we'll
 
04:44:11.430 --> 04:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
get to so how long do you sit in a
 
04:44:13.830 --> 04:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
category that doesn't even make the 6
 
04:44:16.310 --> 04:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
and 3/4 before you cut it loose and say
 
04:44:17.590 --> 04:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
you know what we're just we're just not
 
04:44:19.830 --> 04:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
going to invest
 
04:44:23.230 --> 04:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
in whatever you know Monopoly apartment
 
04:44:25.470 --> 04:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
buildings right you know there's got to
 
04:44:26.990 --> 04:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
be a point where you just go look this
 
04:44:29.350 --> 04:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
is just not it's not making a grade here
 
04:44:31.750 --> 04:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
so and it seemed like your predecessor
 
04:44:34.150 --> 04:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
didn't have any idea what what that
 
04:44:35.430 --> 04:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
would even look like so I'm just
 
04:44:37.788 --> 04:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
wondering what your philosophy is on on
 
04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
categories that have for 25 years have
 
04:44:40.080 --> 04:44:42.350 align:start position:0%
categories that have for 25 years have
failed

04:44:42.350 --> 04:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
failed
 
04:44:46.030 --> 04:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
Madam chair members of the uh committee
 
04:44:48.590 --> 04:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
yeah we can be informal now we're pass
 
04:44:51.990 --> 04:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
the the basic presentation yeah so so My
 
04:44:54.190 --> 04:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
Philosophy it depends on the investment
 
04:44:57.150 --> 04:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
so for public market Investments we have
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
a 30-day termination clause and so and
 
04:45:02.230 --> 04:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's not just looking at the performance
 
04:45:04.230 --> 04:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
and so if it hasn't performed in 25
 
04:45:05.708 --> 04:45:05.718 align:start position:0%
years and you're still investing in it
 
04:45:08.150 --> 04:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
like that's not good um and I and I
 
04:45:12.910 --> 04:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
don't know any investor who would do it
 
04:45:15.150 --> 04:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
for that long and and defend it but we
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
typically look at Short medium and
 
04:45:18.830 --> 04:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
long-term performance which is 1 three
 
04:45:21.230 --> 04:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
and fiveyear periods we also look at how
 
04:45:23.590 --> 04:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
the asset class has let say for example
 
04:45:26.030 --> 04:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
if you're at small caps small cap stocks
 
04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
have not been doing well in the last
 
04:45:29.868 --> 04:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
couple years it's been very tough for
 
04:45:32.590 --> 04:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
them um however the managers that we do
 
04:45:34.670 --> 04:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
have when we do invest in small cap our
 
04:45:36.430 --> 04:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
managers who are picking the stocks are
 
04:45:38.030 --> 04:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
doing active management I think that's
 
04:45:39.590 --> 04:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
the term that I want to use as active
 
04:45:41.910 --> 04:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
managers and they able to make the
 
04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
decision to be uh in one category or the
 
04:45:46.590 --> 04:45:46.600 align:start position:0%
other even though the sector is as a
 
04:45:48.510 --> 04:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
whole is not doing well and so you want
 
04:45:50.788 --> 04:45:50.798 align:start position:0%
to be with those managers and we we we
 
04:45:52.390 --> 04:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
feel we have very strong small capat
 
04:45:54.750 --> 04:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
managers but I don't want to wait long
 
04:45:58.110 --> 04:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to recommend a termination
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
now that's for U Public Market invest U
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
Investments and and that third da Clause
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
is for those for private markets you're
 
04:46:07.550 --> 04:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
typically invested for a draw down fund
 
04:46:10.470 --> 04:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
for 10 plus whatever extensions they
 
04:46:12.310 --> 04:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
they're they're contracted to do so
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
typically two extension two oneyear
 
04:46:16.750 --> 04:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
extensions so you could be in in a in a
 
04:46:19.670 --> 04:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
fund for about 12 years maybe longer and
 
04:46:22.110 --> 04:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
so those Investments you can't really
 
04:46:23.628 --> 04:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
just terminate because if you if you
 
04:46:26.430 --> 04:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
decide to sell it you may sell it at um
 
04:46:28.030 --> 04:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
and you may you're going to take a
 
04:46:29.948 --> 04:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
haircut on selling it and so you don't
 
04:46:32.390 --> 04:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
want to do that so in those cases you
 
04:46:35.470 --> 04:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
want to weigh out okay am I going to get
 
04:46:38.708 --> 04:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
at least my money back um I I'm I'm
 
04:46:39.670 --> 04:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
happy to say that we don't have
 
04:46:41.948 --> 04:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
Investments that are in that category
 
04:46:43.990 --> 04:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
the Investments that my predat servicer
 
04:46:46.310 --> 04:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
has invested in has has done well so
 
04:46:48.910 --> 04:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
that performance is performance that
 
04:46:51.150 --> 04:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
that were generated by on his track
 
04:46:52.750 --> 04:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
record and and I feel that those are
 
04:46:54.830 --> 04:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
really good now some of them may not
 
04:46:57.230 --> 04:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
have done as well but we're continuing
 
04:46:58.830 --> 04:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
that same consistency to be able to
 
04:47:00.390 --> 04:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
invest in Investments that are going to
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
continue to do well so for those private
 
04:47:03.750 --> 04:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
Investments it's tougher to get out of
 
04:47:06.788 --> 04:47:06.798 align:start position:0%
them um but you want to ensure that if
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
if you're not going to be able to get
 
04:47:09.510 --> 04:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
your money back you take some kind of
 
04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
action and so that's part of the
 
04:47:13.548 --> 04:47:13.558 align:start position:0%
monitoring the the risk management and
 
04:47:15.070 --> 04:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
making decisions and recommending
 
04:47:17.430 --> 04:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
decisions to the board uh and the ISC
 
04:47:17.440 --> 04:47:18.350 align:start position:0%
decisions to the board uh and the ISC
for

04:47:18.350 --> 04:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:47:23.390 --> 04:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:26.150 --> 04:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
philosophy representative Lam thank you
 
04:47:27.390 --> 04:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
I have a question which probably I
 
04:47:28.948 --> 04:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
should ask first ask the question of the
 
04:47:31.990 --> 04:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
chair um since I'm the chair of the
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
pension subcommittee and there seems to
 
04:47:35.190 --> 04:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
be a lot of interest of us getting into
 
04:47:37.030 --> 04:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
some of these details should do you
 
04:47:38.350 --> 04:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
think that it would make sense for us to
 
04:47:40.190 --> 04:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
dig into asking more about these asset
 
04:47:42.948 --> 04:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
classes and the investment strategy in a
 
04:47:44.548 --> 04:47:44.558 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting on pension or
 
04:47:46.470 --> 04:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
should I go ahead with my next question
 
04:47:48.510 --> 04:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
I think that would be very appropriate
 
04:47:50.510 --> 04:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
because there are some members who are
 
04:47:53.868 --> 04:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
not not as interested in the details as
 
04:47:57.110 --> 04:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
others okay uh and also anyone on the
 
04:47:58.670 --> 04:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
committee can show up to the
 
04:48:01.830 --> 04:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and participate and also we
 
04:48:03.070 --> 04:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
have no
 
04:48:06.030 --> 04:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
say there's a separation absolutely true
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
a separation a legal separation between
 
04:48:09.830 --> 04:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
the pension system and the legislature
 
04:48:12.350 --> 04:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
all we can do is bring our concerns to
 
04:48:15.750 --> 04:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
them and in fact I was going to comment
 
04:48:19.070 --> 04:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Trustees that if you've
 
04:48:22.430 --> 04:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
got a 25-year investment Horizon keeping
 
04:48:27.310 --> 04:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
25% in fixed assets seems awfully
 
04:48:30.910 --> 04:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
high so but that's a decision for the
 
04:48:33.830 --> 04:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees not for
 
04:48:37.788 --> 04:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
us all right any general questions all
 
04:48:40.390 --> 04:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much for coming our
 
04:48:44.548 --> 04:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
uh oh just oh just a quickie yeah uh I
 
04:48:47.150 --> 04:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
do like the chart on page 41 uh looking
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
forward uh in time into paying down the
 
04:48:53.670 --> 04:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
UA I'm curious is there a similar chart
 
04:48:55.590 --> 04:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
for the historical to see that we're on
 
04:48:57.750 --> 04:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
Trend uh it would be nice just to to
 
04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:03.070 --> 04:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
information um so you would like to see
 
04:49:05.628 --> 04:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
this chart since the beginning of 2010
 
04:49:07.030 --> 04:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
is that what you would
 
04:49:09.350 --> 04:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
like where wherever it is that we
 
04:49:13.670 --> 04:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
decided to assume assume the the debt of
 
04:49:16.590 --> 04:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability uh to today uh
 
04:49:19.110 --> 04:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
Looking Backward around 10 would be the
 
04:49:22.150 --> 04:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
right data yes we'll get that for you
 
04:49:24.670 --> 04:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate it yes and uh there
 
04:49:26.230 --> 04:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
will be like I said there will be a
 
04:49:29.150 --> 04:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on pensions they will be
 
04:49:30.910 --> 04:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly dealing with the bills we
 
04:49:33.390 --> 04:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
have and they'd love to uh Grill you
 
04:49:35.390 --> 04:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
about your investment strategy and so
 
04:49:37.628 --> 04:49:37.638 align:start position:0%
forth represent have one more thing
 
04:49:38.628 --> 04:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
something that I would have liked to
 
04:49:41.470 --> 04:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
have seen um you started giving us
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
historical context around 2007 but I
 
04:49:47.788 --> 04:49:47.798 align:start position:0%
think the 1990s needs to always be in
 
04:49:50.590 --> 04:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
the conversation as to how we ended up
 
04:49:52.750 --> 04:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
in the problem that we're in and the
 
04:49:55.470 --> 04:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
role that this legislature
 
04:49:59.510 --> 04:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
pay in making that problem happen a
 
04:50:01.750 --> 04:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
substantial one so I I would I would
 
04:50:03.590 --> 04:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
like to see that in perpetuity be in
 
04:50:04.708 --> 04:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
there so we understand our
 
04:50:06.910 --> 04:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility to this crisis and it's
 
04:50:08.830 --> 04:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
not mismanagement by the New Hampshire
 
04:50:11.590 --> 04:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
retirement system that led to this it's
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
the it's the fault of the legislature so
 
04:50:18.270 --> 04:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
um having that in there I think would be
 
04:50:21.270 --> 04:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
beneficial yes yes in the early 90s the
 
04:50:23.510 --> 04:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislature mandated the retirement
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
system take on an an unrealistic
 
04:50:32.628 --> 04:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
Actuarial formula so for 15 20 years
 
04:50:35.788 --> 04:50:35.798 align:start position:0%
everybody thought they were overfunded
 
04:50:38.350 --> 04:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
and therefore diverted a large number a
 
04:50:42.830 --> 04:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
large amount of the investment returns
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
into funds that were not the basic
 
04:50:47.430 --> 04:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
retirement fund
 
04:50:50.510 --> 04:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
so uh we got ourselves into a lot of
 
04:50:52.590 --> 04:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
trouble that way and also too we gave a
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
