this is this is how much you have right
 
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
here right to the middle I have very
 
00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 align:start position:0%
approached into your space
 
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
my first my first term so I was like
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
dude dude listen are you serious that's
 
00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
oh hell everybody still played at ass
 
00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
every day well every every uh she every
 
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
every minute we were doing something
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
should be like this
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
and it couldn't help but see because she
 
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
had the size of mine and she it was the
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
difference of Republicans and she was
 
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 align:start position:0%
reporting in from the committee facility
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:38.090 align:start position:0%
it's a tweet it's just a tweet thing I
guess

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.930 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:55.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
so here here's where we're at
 
00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:57.949 align:start position:0%
so here here's where we're at
um

00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
639 which I know most of you are in the
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
room for
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
um is done uh and I have just forwarded
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
to all the committee members so
 
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.410 align:start position:0%
to all the committee members so
um

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:11.449 --> 00:16:11.459 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we're printing them up the
 
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
copies of it now and it's 29 pages so
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
that might take a little moment so in
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
the meantime we do have two other bills
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
so I thought I'd address if they don't
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
show up but I guess maybe I'll just
 
00:16:22.199 --> 00:16:23.150 align:start position:0%
show up but I guess maybe I'll just
collect

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
collect
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
email addresses and send them all to you
 
00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:30.740 align:start position:0%
okay so but uh we do have two other
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
bills that we're taking up today so uh
 
00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
the liquor subcommittee uh the first one
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
is 279 and we do have an amendment here
 
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to subcommittee I
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
refers you can do it do you want to do
 
00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.810 align:start position:0%
refers you can do it do you want to do
it

00:16:58.810 --> 00:16:58.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
okay here's to pass this amendment
 
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.749 align:start position:0%
okay here's to pass this amendment
around

00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
okay see see how that that goes around
 
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
okay so what this amendment does
 
00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
um is basically
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh ads that um the for the the under the
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
current law the fine is five thousand
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
and up to ten days uh we're going to
 
00:17:26.289 --> 00:17:26.299 align:start position:0%
change the first offense is going to be
 
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh find 7 500 rather than 5000 and up to
 
00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:33.299 align:start position:0%
15 days
 
00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:36.299 align:start position:0%
but then it goes on and says if there is
 
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
documented attendance of the licensed
 
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
Personnel at a commission sponsored
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
educational program before the injury or
 
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
death either online or in person if
 
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
there is no such documentation
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
the suspension shall be 30 days
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
so this is the attempt is to create a
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
carrot to uh for restaurants and
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
licensees to uh
 
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
make sure all their employees are are
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
released to the employees they think
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
might overserve that they would make
 
00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
sure that they have have a carriage to
 
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
be inspired to make sure that their
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.210 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:24.980 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
am I uh it doesn't matter just
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
observation yeah
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
a change in this latest version the
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
second offense
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
the license shall be revoked correct so
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
that that's a change from the previous
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
no that's actually current law that's
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
current law but I mean the the previous
 
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
version of this bill that we saw it did
 
00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:48.539 align:start position:0%
not have that second program because it
 
00:18:51.289 --> 00:18:51.299 align:start position:0%
was written yeah it was it was setting
 
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
up as a separate RSA right so
 
00:18:57.529 --> 00:18:57.539 align:start position:0%
any other questions any questions from
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
the audience I have a question
 
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
yes um you um
 
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
so you've changed the in so that you've
 
00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:06.419 align:start position:0%
increased the fine and the days right
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
yes the fine just create increase to
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
from five to seventy five hundred and
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
yes but the days went from 10 to 15.
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
correct but it's still up two
 
00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539 align:start position:0%
two so that gives the commission a
 
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:20.220 align:start position:0%
little bit of wiggle room to decide how
 
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.770 align:start position:0%
little bit of wiggle room to decide how
severe

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
severe
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
everybody comfortable with that
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
I don't have myself I have the correct
 
00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:39.419 align:start position:0%
we have the correct
 
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
the committee here let me actually let
 
00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:45.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:51.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh read it again
 
00:19:58.970 --> 00:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
it's a good self-promotion
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.230 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm missing some uh
 
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:39.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:45.169 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:20:45.169 --> 00:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.169 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment number is
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
oh five two six h
 
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.529 align:start position:0%
oh five two six h
and

00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:15.539 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:15.539 --> 00:21:16.930 align:start position:0%
and
second

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:16.940 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
Oh I thought we were head discussion
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
okay yeah all right so we have a motion
 
00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:24.299 align:start position:0%
and discussion okay
 
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that you know this this
 
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
makes a difference and it ties it to
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
education however with the first offense
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
um again I'll use the red park in my
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
community as an example they could even
 
00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:39.059 align:start position:0%
with training they could have been fined
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
and closed 15 consecutive days which
 
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
would have really closed them down and
 
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
caused people to lose their jobs even in
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
a scenario where somebody was
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
intoxicated they went out to their car
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
and they were empty bear cans all over
 
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
it which indicated that there was at
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
least a good possibility that they
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
hadn't served them
 
00:21:59.810 --> 00:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
um that alcohol they drove this person
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
home but I'm just saying if that had
 
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:03.380 align:start position:0%
come to an accident
 
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
why you're going to punish them if this
 
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
guy was drinking beer in his van or took
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
a pill or whatever
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
okay well we do have the commission my
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they do a long
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
investigation before the hearing process
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
and so if it became clear that that
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
person had been drinking somewhere else
 
00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:27.059 align:start position:0%
prior to coming into the facility uh
 
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
then then that is the reason why it's up
 
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
too but would there be a Toxicology test
 
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
I mean to know that they had a pill in
 
00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:36.059 align:start position:0%
their system which is all you know
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
happens also somebody goes in the
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
restroom it could snort coke or whatever
 
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
right so you think you're saying you
 
00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
would rather see that stay you'd rather
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
see that stay at 10 days
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
no I'm just saying I'm saying I'm just
 
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
asking what do you what do you think is
 
00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
the right answer I'm not the right
 
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
answer is I'm not sure even with this
 
00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:54.299 align:start position:0%
amendment the bill is going to do what
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
we wanted so you don't want to pass the
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
bill the amendment at all
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
you don't want to ever have don't ever
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
do something or never you want to leave
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
the current law as it is and only add in
 
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
this 30 days
 
00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
if they don't have training or do you
 
00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:09.539 align:start position:0%
still that because that's 30 days is one
 
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
one business that's putting them out of
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
business exactly well so 15 days could
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
also again even if they do the training
 
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
anybody else from right yeah I mean I
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
I have a similar I mean I like the idea
 
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
of the training thing like the character
 
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.570 align:start position:0%
of the training thing like the character
approach

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.370 align:start position:0%
approach
um

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
I guess this is the existing law or not
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
this isn't but existing law is 10 days
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
right so that's that we're not
 
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
discussing that the existing law is up
 
00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
to 10 days and five thousand dollar fine
 
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
right uh or 2500 right got that right I
 
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
think it's 2500 all but that doesn't
 
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.529 align:start position:0%
think it's 2500 all but that doesn't
matter

00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
um I think that's what it says here yeah
 
00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:49.730 align:start position:0%
um I think that's what it says here yeah
um

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
but anyway so yeah my my concern I mean
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's similar it's similar to what
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative borrow says which is
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
the the goal is to prevent what happened
 
00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:04.100 align:start position:0%
from happening and it seems to me
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
changing the initial I mean the law is
 
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
on the book as it is with 10 days I
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
don't know why we need to work with that
 
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
if we think training is the ultimate
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
issue right then maybe that carrot
 
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
approach of if you have documentation I
 
00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:18.419 align:start position:0%
could be comfortable with that but the
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
idea of changing the other one the
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
actual penalty yeah so you would rather
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
see it just leave it at five and ten
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars yeah whatever the
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
original Law is but then add in this
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
piece then add in this one then that
 
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
makes it I mean we can have a separate
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
discussion of whether or not we think
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
this is going to accomplish the goal it
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
is but if this is what we want to do I
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
don't think we want to change the
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
initial penalty about that that would be
 
00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.149 align:start position:0%
initial penalty about that that would be
fine

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
who who else has a feeling agree with
 
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
that concept and to be on the committee
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
you agree with that representative
 
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.830 align:start position:0%
you agree with that representative
Osborne

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
Osborne
 
00:24:54.649 --> 00:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
and representative Vinson who's a member
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:03.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
I actually am in favor of the amendment
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
and the bill the way it is right now is
 
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
it stands
 
00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.450 align:start position:0%
it stands
um

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
I think that establishments
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
um know the deal I personally feel that
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission is not going after
 
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
these establishments just to take their
 
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.649 align:start position:0%
these establishments just to take their
license

00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
if something of the magnitude of someone
 
00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
to be intoxicated and hurts one of us or
 
00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
kills one of us or our family members or
 
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
someone of the public
 
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire or out of state because
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people obviously travel
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
in and out I just think that the the
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
punishment uh
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
I just think that it's something that is
 
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
just needs to have some
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
some meat to it so to speak and I don't
 
00:25:57.169 --> 00:25:57.179 align:start position:0%
mean to be insensitive I don't think
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
that the like I was going to say I don't
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
think that the liquor commissioner is
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
going out and picking on businesses just
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
to lose their license or find them I
 
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
don't think that's what the case here is
 
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:08.390 align:start position:0%
and I think they do have good judgment
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.990 align:start position:0%
and I think they do have good judgment
[Music]

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:09.590 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
to keep us safe I mean what else can I
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
say I just uh I like the way it is right
 
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
now thank you you like the amendment as
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
is presented I like the way it is right
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
now presented yes okay uh representative
 
00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:24.419 align:start position:0%
wolf you have an opinion
 
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh yes I agree with my fellow
 
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
representative that if
 
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
set high enough then the businesses will
 
00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
ensure that their bartenders and servers
 
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
are trained appropriately
 
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
I think if it goes back to the other
 
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
well I think there's if you think it's
 
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
the training is what's necessary then
 
00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
raising the other two is maybe
 
00:26:57.779 --> 00:26:59.630 align:start position:0%
raising the other two is maybe
unnecessary

00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I think is what I'm
 
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
hearing from these committee members
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
which is that because we're bringing in
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
this whole new uh Draconian concept that
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
we could be shut down for 30 days if you
 
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
didn't have training why why do we need
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
to raise the fine
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
from five to seventy five hundred or why
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
do we need to raise the commission's 10
 
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
to 15 days well I think this ensures it
 
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
it helps to ensure that the training
 
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.169 align:start position:0%
it helps to ensure that the training
occurs

00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
and we'll actually would undermine the
 
00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
trade if they'll get away with that
 
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
right well I hear you all right okay all
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
right yeah representative Sullivan yeah
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
I mean I think
 
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
I think um what representative hunt was
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
saying is is what how I view it so if I
 
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
own a bar and I have this current
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework in front of us and
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
we now have this new regulation coming
 
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
in saying that we need to
 
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
we have this current law that we
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
understand or if if we get caught
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
breaking this law or violating this
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
regulation then we could lose our
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
licensing up to or our business close
 
00:28:03.409 --> 00:28:03.419 align:start position:0%
for 30 days and we pay this increased
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
fine if if the people haven't been
 
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
trained there's now an incentive to
 
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
train train people if we think training
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
is going to be the solution to this
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
problem which it sounds to me from
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
talking to people over the last few
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
weeks people are concerned that maybe
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
these bartenders aren't properly trained
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that the 15 day
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
suspension or the changing of the
 
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
initial framework in any way
 
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
incentivizes it doesn't even impact the
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
incentive to train people
 
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
um because once you start training it
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
you are exempt from this 30-day thing so
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
I think the 30-day thing is the carrot
 
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
that's going to try to
 
00:28:39.769 --> 00:28:39.779 align:start position:0%
try to get them going that's how I
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
interpret the way this law works
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's why I said we
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
shouldn't play with the other one and I
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
got it John and incentivize people to go
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
for for uh 30-day training if that's
 
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
what you really want
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
so you you want to respond you
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
you don't have to yeah I did
 
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
okay representative uh thank you Mr
 
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.470 align:start position:0%
okay representative uh thank you Mr
chairman

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
um some of you
 
00:29:09.409 --> 00:29:09.419 align:start position:0%
can you hear me uh I uh put forward this
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh Amendment and think it should pass
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
I am a licensed server in the state of
 
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I went through the
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
training I used to test I've been a
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
bartender on and off since the 60s and I
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
believe this is the deterrent I think
 
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
another carrot which could be hung out
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
there in the future is that if all your
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
servers are licensed the insurance
 
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
premiums might go down
 
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
which would which would mean that their
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
liability would be decreased so I think
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
this is a good Amendment and I think it
 
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
should pass and if for some reason we
 
00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
want to improve it next year we can
 
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:54.539 align:start position:0%
improve it next year but to put
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
something in place like this now is very
 
00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
important thank you
 
00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.649 align:start position:0%
important thank you
okay

00:30:00.649 --> 00:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
okay uh let me make sure I hit everybody
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
who's on the uh subcommittee first and
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
okay like Burrows you're you're like you
 
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
would like that new proposal right
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment no no the new proposal
 
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
not the amendment but to to take this
 
00:30:18.289 --> 00:30:18.299 align:start position:0%
amendment and and put the 75 down back
 
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
to 5 000 yeah and to 15 back to 10. okay
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
all right so that's and Representative
 
00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:27.299 align:start position:0%
Vincent doesn't like that okay so now
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
I'll throw it open to the other
 
00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to highlight
 
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
that this amendment allows for one
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
strike and then you're out there's no
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
um there's no
 
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
um leeway for the commission
 
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.490 align:start position:0%
um leeway for the commission
to

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419 align:start position:0%
examine circumstances on a second
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
offense and I I don't know that that's
 
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
current law I'm trying to find it but
 
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
maybe we could clarify
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%
so that would be something else that's
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
different from the previous version that
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
we saw that is concerning if that's the
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
case yeah I think
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
I think we need the commission to have
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
some we can't think of everything in our
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
rules so we need to give them some
 
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
flexibility and if the rule says that
 
00:31:12.649 --> 00:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
one strike you're out that's concerning
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
other members that you may represent a
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
Mac later
 
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it says one strike in
 
00:31:21.529 --> 00:31:21.539 align:start position:0%
your route I think it says if you
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
obviously if you have a second uh
 
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
situation it's much more serious and I
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
would expect the Liquor Commission would
 
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
take that into account and and and do
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
their proper investigation it does say
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
second offense and you lose your license
 
00:31:35.399 --> 00:31:36.669 align:start position:0%
second offense and you lose your license
yeah

00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
shall be revoked but it has to be it has
 
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
to be proven though
 
00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
that so it's not just that oh wait a
 
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
minute okay I ran over somebody because
 
00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:48.539 align:start position:0%
he was drunk
 
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
um but we're not going to investigate it
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
they might find out that he again had
 
00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:54.059 align:start position:0%
had all his beers in his car or
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
something like that so I don't think
 
00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:57.059 align:start position:0%
it's one strike and you're out I think
 
00:31:59.930 --> 00:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's two strikes and you're out
 
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
that's the way I read it well as as a
 
00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
final verdict right okay that's a
 
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
semantic but okay I can strike you're
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
out yes other than that I support uh uh
 
00:32:12.409 --> 00:32:12.419 align:start position:0%
representative Vinson representative
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
Walsh and representative petusic that I
 
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
think that as this bill is written
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
although I would be willing to
 
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
compromise I I think it it's it it
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
really puts some teeth into the bill and
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
that's what we need some real teeth
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
thank you I think I think we I mean
 
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
we we trust the Liquor Commission to do
 
00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
to do investigations and I think the
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
electorate commission maybe if we had
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
language on the second Offense for the
 
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission to decide whether or
 
00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.409 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission to decide whether or
not

00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:42.419 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
the circumstances weren't a permanent
 
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
local closing down of the establishment
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
I think if that's automatic based on the
 
00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:51.059 align:start position:0%
statute uh I think that seems a little
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
severe and it takes away from the people
 
00:32:54.169 --> 00:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
on the ground doing the investigation
 
00:32:54.179 --> 00:32:58.090 align:start position:0%
on the ground doing the investigation
yeah

00:32:58.090 --> 00:32:58.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
no not yet okay because we might be
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:06.529 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:10.140 align:start position:0%
oh me thank you waiting to hear my name
 
00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman that's right
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
so I I just want to be clear so that we
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
know what we're doing when we do what we
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
do if we do this
 
00:33:21.769 --> 00:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
and I'm not arguing against this but
 
00:33:24.529 --> 00:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
with respect to the language on line 15
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
for the second offense which we Now
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
understand will be a determination made
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
by The Liquor Commission the enforcement
 
00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:33.059 align:start position:0%
Folks At The Liquor Commission the
 
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
on-premises license shall be revoked
 
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
this potentially could occur
 
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
within a year
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
or it could be five or ten years later
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
a second offense is a second offense and
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
second strike you're out and it could be
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
10 15 years later just so we understand
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with that because a second
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
offense is a second offense it's the
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
first offense is so serious
 
00:34:03.169 --> 00:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
that the establishment needs to make
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
sure that it never happens again not
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
just within a year or three years or
 
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
five years but never again thank you
 
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just offering this as a possibility
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of giving the Liquor Commission
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
um some leeway depending on what they
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
find in their investigation that we
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
consider changing for the second event
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
for the second offense the on-premises
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
license shall be revoked to the
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
oh go separate the on and off premises
 
00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.470 align:start position:0%
oh go separate the on and off premises
no

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
sorry uh excuse me
 
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
um maybe I wasn't clear yeah changing
 
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
shell to May
 
00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:53.339 align:start position:0%
to give the Liquor Commission some
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
leeway in their determination but this
 
00:34:58.089 --> 00:34:58.099 align:start position:0%
is current law now
 
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
I understand that
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
um but the disc okay I have not read the
 
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
current law there seem to be some
 
00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.630 align:start position:0%
current law there seem to be some
discussion

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Ammon I think was
 
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
was questioning whether it's current law
 
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
but there was some discussion as to
 
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:12.730 align:start position:0%
but there was some discussion as to
whether

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:12.740 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
shall is too rigid
 
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
um so I'm offering as an alternative May
 
00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.650 align:start position:0%
um so I'm offering as an alternative May
okay

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
representative texting
 
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
well I was actually going to make the
 
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
same suggestion that Representatives
 
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs made my concern
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
with any of these things is to deny what
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
I would call judicial discretion in this
 
00:35:41.089 --> 00:35:41.099 align:start position:0%
case it's the the commission has that
 
00:35:41.099 --> 00:35:42.890 align:start position:0%
case it's the the commission has that
position

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
there are things that are going to be
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
on the line I don't want to I don't want
 
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
to punish somebody unfairly and I I have
 
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:55.079 align:start position:0%
an issue if it's if if if the second
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
offense is six months later I agree
 
00:35:59.450 --> 00:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
you've really got an issue but if it's
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
15 years later
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
and it's right on the line with this law
 
00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:05.780 align:start position:0%
they're out of business period the end
 
00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
and sometimes things are unavoidable so
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
for that reason I would like to leave
 
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
more latitude on the commission's part
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
rather than less
 
00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
it's not a lot more but it's a little
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
bit less so
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
this would if you have a a brawl in your
 
00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
bar for some reason
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
of you know the Democrats fighting uh
 
00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:41.390 align:start position:0%
Ammon you know
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:44.230 align:start position:0%
Ammon you know
[Laughter]

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
but and you know what I mean I mean
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
everybody saw I was thinking a car
 
00:36:59.329 --> 00:36:59.339 align:start position:0%
accident took beer in the car but if you
 
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
have if you have a dispute and they
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
could all be sober
 
00:37:05.569 --> 00:37:05.579 align:start position:0%
but uh and had three drinks each in the
 
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
last four hours and somebody gets hurt
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
is that uh is that going to be
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
applicable to this this uh punishment it
 
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
says bodily injury so it could be
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
anything so that's where the up two
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
comes up to come kicks in so the answer
 
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
is yes
 
00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
so I would I would say that in terms of
 
00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:29.339 align:start position:0%
the second offense as representative
 
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's what we pointed out first you
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
have to they have to have documented and
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
proven that the second effects offense
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
actually did occur right that that was
 
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
the licensee it travels with the
 
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.370 align:start position:0%
the licensee it travels with the
licensee

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
licensee
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
licensee so
 
00:37:57.970 --> 00:37:57.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
Valley and it would not follow that
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
manager it would be the Applebee's
 
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
yes the Applebee's license and is that
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
that location license or that would be
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
if Applebee's has multiple license it
 
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
would it'd have to be that location
 
00:38:19.609 --> 00:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
um well my personal opinion is I'm I I
 
00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
take these things the legislation
 
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.430 align:start position:0%
take these things the legislation
um

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.170 align:start position:0%
 
incrementally

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
incrementally
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
um we have over the years have not done
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
anything you know we've had this bill
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
put in multiple times to mandate the
 
00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.470 align:start position:0%
put in multiple times to mandate the
training

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.150 align:start position:0%
training
and

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:43.849 --> 00:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
um and we've always the committee has
 
00:38:47.329 --> 00:38:47.339 align:start position:0%
failed to ever do that so given that I'm
 
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
the one who said well why don't we do it
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
this way
 
00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:53.099 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I'm I'm more apt to say
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
that I was offering that up
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
um as a compromise from
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
not passing something
 
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
the changing of the of the penalties and
 
00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
the time frames
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
um I think was uh trying to relate it to
 
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
the the current
 
00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
that we would take more steps further
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
what the bill was but since I've come in
 
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
with this kind of compromise I guess I'd
 
00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:23.339 align:start position:0%
be more apt to be willing to stay with
 
00:39:23.339 --> 00:39:24.349 align:start position:0%
be more apt to be willing to stay with
the

00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
um 5000
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
and and 10 days on the assumption that
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
then this is only a little incremental
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
piece it's a carrot so it's a comp and
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
the compromise is a carrot and it seems
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
a solution to the problem without having
 
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
to dramatically change it so if you know
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
if the Senators feel differently they
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
want to have more or as as
 
00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:50.339 align:start position:0%
representative said if we need to come
 
00:39:53.089 --> 00:39:53.099 align:start position:0%
back and visit it because we feel that
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
that wasn't enough you know we can
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
certainly do that but I I guess I'd be
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
more inclined to
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
um stick stick with the current law but
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
just add in this New Concept so how many
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
people were outrageous to clarify the
 
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
New Concept is the if they're if they
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
have not had the training it's the
 
00:40:14.089 --> 00:40:14.099 align:start position:0%
automatic 30 days what do we think about
 
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
the land in the second shall revoke
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
license on the second offense I would
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
just gets current law child be revoked
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
oh current law is three
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
oh geez three what okay so that would
 
00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
turn the shell into May okay I guess so
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
what so right now the current what is it
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
does it say anything about the second
 
00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
so so I I would be more apt to leave the
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
current law in place I'm comfortable
 
00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
with that and just only thing to change
 
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
is just adding in this extra extra 30
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
day uh the 30-day only ifs if on the
 
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
first offense 30 days added uh if the
 
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
train if the employee didn't have
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
training yes so Mr chairman because I I
 
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
think illustrations always help if we
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
could go back to the unfortunate
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
event that was described To Us by the
 
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
family that lost their daughter what
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
would happen here to this establishment
 
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
it being the establishment's first
 
00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
offense right that they could be fined
 
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars correct and be
 
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
closed for up to 15 days 30 days 30 days
 
00:41:28.609 --> 00:41:28.619 align:start position:0%
well it says it would be mandatory
 
00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:31.619 align:start position:0%
Thursday now it would be 30 days because
 
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
yeah I hadn't gone through that yeah oh
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
I see because because from the testimony
 
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
I heard
 
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
it appears that there had been no
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
training correct of the the servers
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
right bartender so for the loss of that
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
particular life we're talking about 30
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
days and five thousand dollars
 
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
on the first
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
the establishment's first offense
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
if there are any subsequent offenses of
 
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
this nature
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
by this establishment whether it be a
 
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
year five years or ten years then right
 
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
now unless the language has changed the
 
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
language says shall be revoked rather
 
00:42:16.849 --> 00:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
than may be revoked that's in this bill
 
00:42:19.849 --> 00:42:19.859 align:start position:0%
but under current law so what I'm I'm go
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm now inclined to just uh take the
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
current law and just add in that on the
 
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
first offense
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
the 30-day
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
kicks in if they don't have training
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
under current law it is now if I
 
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
understand it it's up to 30 to 60 days
 
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
that's okay so maybe we want to put it
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
in RSA put it in the statute okay yeah
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
and then and then the third offense
 
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
is is they lose their license the
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
license is gone so now we have to change
 
00:42:58.089 --> 00:42:58.099 align:start position:0%
this to this the third because right now
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
we would draft another one we would be
 
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
drafting another amendment yes well but
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
I want to get consensus that that's the
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
way we want to go before I would just
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
say because this is this is multifaceted
 
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
with throwing all kinds of numbers
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
around it it's going to be really
 
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
helpful to actually see the next
 
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
iteration of the amendment I hear you so
 
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative Gibbs
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
um just for clarification I'd just like
 
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
to go through this to make sure I'm I'm
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
understanding it correctly and I'll be
 
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
as quick as I can because I understand
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
that we'll see a new written version so
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
for the first offense if there's
 
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
training the licensee would be fined
 
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars and the license
 
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
suspended for up to 10 days correct if
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
there's no documentation of training
 
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
this is license shall be suspended for
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
30 days correct for the second defense
 
00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
the license shall be suspended for 30 to
 
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
60 days up two yes up to 30. right is it
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
up two and that's in rule no it's not it
 
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't say up to it just says 30
 
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
30 to 60 days is there's no up to when
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
the second offense so that's what we
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
would put in this test that's where we
 
00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
were 30 60 days and for the third
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
offense the license shall be revoked
 
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
correct and how much money on the 30 to
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
60 on the second offense yeah how much
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
is the fine in the 30 60.
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
no second offense
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's still at five still five so there's
 
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
no step up in the fight it's 2500 the
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
person oh the first is 2500 yeah then it
 
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
goes to five
 
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.470 align:start position:0%
goes to five
okay

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
I know the current owner okay uh yes and
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's a rule
 
00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
um how do we Define serious bodily
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
injury so how do you guys Define serious
 
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
bodily injury
 
00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.089 align:start position:0%
bodily injury
okay

00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:50.099 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
um representative Sullivan yeah so I'm I
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
just started thinking so we're gonna try
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
to get people to get trained that's our
 
00:44:58.849 --> 00:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
goal so this training offered by the the
 
00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
alcohol commission right
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
um Okay so
 
00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.220 align:start position:0%
my question is how much does it cost
 
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
anything is it free a free online thing
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
great okay and then so if I if I have a
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
bar and I have a server who gets trained
 
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
and then that server leaves to go to
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
you know representative hunts Barr did
 
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
that travel with them or do they have to
 
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
get retrained I feel like that's
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
really it does and does it expire at
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
some period of time
 
00:45:25.319 --> 00:45:26.210 align:start position:0%
some period of time
okay

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
so so if I got trained once 10 years
 
00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:32.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay so just so everybody understands
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
what happens that the training obviously
 
00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
the the file that's kept on that
 
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
employee's training is klept by the
 
00:45:41.339 --> 00:45:43.430 align:start position:0%
employee's training is klept by the
employer

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
employer
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
right does the commission keep fi you
 
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:49.140 align:start position:0%
will you would have records so if that
 
00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:50.579 align:start position:0%
employee showed up at a different
 
00:45:53.089 --> 00:45:53.099 align:start position:0%
facility you would still have records
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
that that employee did have the training
 
00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:05.990 align:start position:0%
that that employee did have the training
okay

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
okay right so you get somebody to
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
suitable framing all right okay
 
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative I just have a question
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
about the training I've never seen the
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
training so obviously I mean I haven't
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
taken the training so
 
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
um and I've I heard somebody disparage
 
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
the training as quote a joke now I
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
understand that anybody can characterize
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
anything any the way anybody wants to
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
characterize the training so I'm not
 
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
saying that the training is a joke I'm
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
just saying I heard this but that
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
prompts the question is this training
 
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
these training modules have have you
 
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
developed these in-house
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
um or with the assistance of um uh
 
00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:48.980 align:start position:0%
others in the field
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
and for example Partners in other states
 
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
could you just describe briefly how you
 
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
put the training modules together or how
 
00:47:01.609 --> 00:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
you obtain them thank you
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
yes so they are created in-house
 
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
um the training goes over a very
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
comprehensive amount of information it
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
includes license requirements and
 
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
includes fake ID detection and includes
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
detection on visible signs of
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
intoxication it also goes over server
 
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
liability license liability and also
 
00:47:20.329 --> 00:47:20.339 align:start position:0%
discusses responsible business practices
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
for license establishments that they can
 
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.290 align:start position:0%
for license establishments that they can
Implement

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:23.300 align:start position:0%
Implement
 
00:47:26.329 --> 00:47:26.339 align:start position:0%
in order to prevent instances like this
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
it goes over statutes that are relevant
 
00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
to not only their license type but the
 
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
entire industry we have this training
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
program is updated every year we
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
evaluate it every year we are part of
 
00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
several National groups in terms of the
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
regulation of alcohol we are on
 
00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
education committees within those groups
 
00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
where we meet annually and share
 
00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
training programs with each other so
 
00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that goes into these these
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
training programs we have ones that are
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
specified for one day licenses we have
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
ones that are specific to retail tobacco
 
00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
the there's management directed
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
licensing there's server directed
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
licensing there's off sale directed
 
00:48:08.329 --> 00:48:08.339 align:start position:0%
licensing there's on sale directed
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
licensing there's direct shipper
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
training so all of that you know there's
 
00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
several different training programs we
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
have a training program that's specific
 
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:19.700 align:start position:0%
for Liquor security
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
so we've we've tried to cover all the
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
basis within each licensed establishment
 
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
and much of the training is data driven
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
and relevant to liability New Hampshire
 
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
laws and regulations for the question
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
so in thank you for the comprehensive uh
 
00:48:38.819 --> 00:48:39.950 align:start position:0%
so in thank you for the comprehensive uh
response

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
response
 
00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
so in short
 
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
would you say that um your uh training
 
00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.890 align:start position:0%
would you say that um your uh training
piece

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
piece
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
um would uh would would pass scrutiny as
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
best practices because of how
 
00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
comprehensive it is the work that you do
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
the consultations with peers and so
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
forth that you would feel comfortable
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
having it uh looked at in terms of best
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
practices and and you you feel very
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
confident that it would it would pass
 
00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:11.579 align:start position:0%
with flying colors absolutely thank you
 
00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I think last time you were
 
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
here I asked you this question and I'm
 
00:49:23.809 --> 00:49:23.819 align:start position:0%
not clear on whether you would do
 
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
in-house training in other words if I
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
had a bartender not a bartender owner
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
want to put on a class in person now how
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
much would that cost zero zero zero okay
 
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.230 align:start position:0%
much would that cost zero zero zero okay
um

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:40.849 --> 00:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
secondly we mentioned that a licensee in
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
a case that could lose their license how
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
about the server How about if there was
 
00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
a specific server involved would they
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
lose their certificate of training
 
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
there there is no there is no bartender
 
00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
or server license in this state there is
 
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
a potential for criminal charges against
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
a specific server the training is just a
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
training certificate identifying that
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
you took the training there's no server
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
license there's no this is John Hunt's
 
00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
rule of licensure we create license so
 
00:50:14.569 --> 00:50:14.579 align:start position:0%
we can take it away so if we don't if
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have a license there's nothing
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
for us to take I'm asking about the
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
certificate could you revoke the
 
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.230 align:start position:0%
certificate could you revoke the
certificate

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative Walsh
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh just going back to the new verbiage
 
00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.230 align:start position:0%
uh just going back to the new verbiage
for

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:50:34.849 --> 00:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
the new amendment that we're working
 
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
potential Amendment yes potential
 
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
Amendment so for the second offense
 
00:50:41.089 --> 00:50:41.099 align:start position:0%
is there a dollar amount I think that
 
00:50:44.089 --> 00:50:44.099 align:start position:0%
needs to be stepped that was that was my
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
all my notes here can we go through the
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
three steps so the first step is you say
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
was 2500
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
and up to or just says 10 days it is a
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
10 day it's a drop dead 10 days
 
00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.730 align:start position:0%
10 day it's a drop dead 10 days
okay

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:00.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
2510 days
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
the second offense
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
the second offense is
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
a suspension for 30 to 60 consecutive
 
00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:13.130 align:start position:0%
a suspension for 30 to 60 consecutive
days

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
and an administrative fine of five
 
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.130 align:start position:0%
and an administrative fine of five
thousand

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
and that's not up to that's a fine of
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
five thousand correct well it's a shall
 
00:51:23.089 --> 00:51:23.099 align:start position:0%
not exceed five thousand okay so that
 
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
isn't up too that's an up two okay
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
whereas the 2500 it's hard on the first
 
00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.390 align:start position:0%
whereas the 2500 it's hard on the first
offense

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
that is it shall not exceed either
 
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
that's enough two also correct okay so
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's up to up to up to 2500 hard 10
 
00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.849 align:start position:0%
that's up to up to up to 2500 hard 10
days

00:51:42.849 --> 00:51:42.859 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
statute or rule this well this
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
combination is evidently combination of
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
two so so statue only a statute allows
 
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
for a maximum fine of five thousand and
 
00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
for uh penalties that include suspension
 
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
and or up to revocation that so to set
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
the limits correct it didn't set the
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
tier system the tears are in rule so the
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
second offense
 
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
um is actually kind of has its own tiers
 
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
as it is right now okay so for the
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
second offense a license suspension for
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
30 to 60 consecutive days or an
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
administrative fine which shall not
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
exceed five thousand and a suspension of
 
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.180 align:start position:0%
not less than 10 nor more than 60
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
consecutive days oh so it's not even one
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's Ten Ten to Ten to sixty it's if you
 
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.490 align:start position:0%
it's Ten Ten to Ten to sixty it's if you
you

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
so it would be
 
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
it's tough to describe it would be if
 
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
you do a five thousand dollar fine then
 
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
there is not less than 10 nor more than
 
00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
60. but you can have a suspension for 30
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
to 60. if you don't do a fine
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
oh so you the commission has a wiggle
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
room on the fine
 
00:52:54.049 --> 00:52:54.059 align:start position:0%
license suspension for 30 to 60
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
consecutive days or an administrative
 
00:52:59.930 --> 00:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
fine which shall not exceed 5000 and a
 
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
suspension not less than 10 or more than
 
00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:04.150 align:start position:0%
suspension not less than 10 or more than
60.

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
60.
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me so kind of contract have you
 
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
gotten into these situations I'm trying
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
to imagine what the process is that
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
you're going through with all of these
 
00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:14.540 align:start position:0%
different combinations and
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
permutations of rules we're currently
 
00:53:19.609 --> 00:53:19.619 align:start position:0%
rewriting this section of role a good
 
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
time for us to be revisiting it isn't it
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
this sounds good we're actually right in
 
00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
the middle so we're absolutely Byzantine
 
00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:28.690 align:start position:0%
the middle so we're absolutely Byzantine
yes

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:28.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
well it it does feel like it is a lot of
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
wiggle room in there which obviously the
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
legislature would never intentionally do
 
00:53:37.609 --> 00:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
that but so but they did it when they
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
just sent the caps and then you guys
 
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
within the penalty section of the
 
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
statute we are required to consider
 
00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
aggravating and mitigating factors when
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
applying penalties
 
00:53:52.609 --> 00:53:52.619 align:start position:0%
aggravating and mitigating factors are
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
actually outlined in rule as to what
 
00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
those can what those are training is
 
00:53:59.809 --> 00:53:59.819 align:start position:0%
actually an aggravating or a mitigating
 
00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:02.420 align:start position:0%
Factor so that is something when we have
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
a rule that says the penalty range is
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
such training is actually accounted
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
correct if you have it it's a mitigating
 
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
if you don't it's an aggravating
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
so that's what I believe this range is
 
00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
is we are required by Statute to take
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
into account those aggravating and
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
mitigating factors when applying the
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
range of penalties okay representative
 
00:54:24.839 --> 00:54:26.270 align:start position:0%
range of penalties okay representative
Gibbs

00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
Gibbs
 
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
um could you provide the committee uh
 
00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
with your current rules
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
um on penalties both
 
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
um the steps and the description of the
 
00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:41.780 align:start position:0%
aggravating here's the problem with that
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
this bill has to be out
 
00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:46.670 align:start position:0%
this bill has to be out
tomorrow

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:50.339 align:start position:0%
ah okay and unless you want to come back
 
00:54:50.339 --> 00:54:51.349 align:start position:0%
ah okay and unless you want to come back
tomorrow

00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
we've got to figure this out today
 
00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
or we have to retain the bill
 
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
so I think we can come up with something
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
and then number three three step three
 
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
values like it's just a total outright
 
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
repo three is for a third offense
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
license revocation okay so we got three
 
00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
set okay we got three set so the issue
 
00:55:17.569 --> 00:55:17.579 align:start position:0%
now really is the one to two correct
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
okay and if
 
00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.609 align:start position:0%
okay and if
um

00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:24.530 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
uh so that I I guess what we if I if so
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
not all the more reasons maybe to go
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
back to that five thousand you because
 
00:55:33.049 --> 00:55:33.059 align:start position:0%
that for the first offense because
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
that's an increase from twenty five
 
00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.650 align:start position:0%
that's an increase from twenty five
hundred

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
yes right so the first offense being
 
00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:40.730 align:start position:0%
yes right so the first offense being
being

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.750 align:start position:0%
being
um

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
is being okay so if we go if we go to
 
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
five thousand
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
and then and it's it's it is the up to
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
10 days did you say not to exceed
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
to 10 days okay
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
so that that's the 10 days of oh no I'm
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
sorry the fine the fine shall not exceed
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
2500 the suspension is for 10 days the
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
first event is 410. so all the reason
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
why 10 days is a good number too
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
so then the issue is the second
 
00:56:14.089 --> 00:56:14.099 align:start position:0%
violation yes Mr chairman how can for
 
00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
the second violation the on-premises
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
license be revoked and on the third it'd
 
00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
be revoked so you get to a third you can
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
take it out I'm thinking we're gonna
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
going to take out the second we're just
 
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
going to have the first events yes
 
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
um and do we do we want to really wait
 
00:56:32.089 --> 00:56:32.099 align:start position:0%
to the Third
 
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
that's it to provoke good question
 
00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:42.140 align:start position:0%
yes has anybody ever been twice yeah
 
00:56:45.049 --> 00:56:45.059 align:start position:0%
have you ever had a scenario where
 
00:56:47.569 --> 00:56:47.579 align:start position:0%
the operation was so egregious that you
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to revoke the license on the
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
first offense but were unable to
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yes but were you able to do it on
 
00:56:56.809 --> 00:56:56.819 align:start position:0%
your current law that would be this case
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
the case we have in front of us now only
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
Rachel said we would have what well so
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
is there a way to structure the sentence
 
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
in such a way that revocation is always
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
an option but after the third offense
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
there is no choice
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
that's what right now
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
well yeah I know right now I am in terms
 
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
of right right now the penalty is 10
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
days and a fine not exceeding 2500. that
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
is the only option no matter how bad no
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
matter how bad it is no matter
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
aggravating or mitigating factors but if
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
we can pass something today yes with
 
00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
this amendment it would be at least 30
 
00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:30.890 align:start position:0%
this amendment it would be at least 30
days

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
if the person didn't have the training
 
00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:35.180 align:start position:0%
well no I I understand that but
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
I wanna on the one hand I want to give
 
00:57:40.849 --> 00:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
them more latitude saying I can pull
 
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
your license on the first offense if you
 
00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:47.339 align:start position:0%
are really egregiously bad but on the
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
other hand I'd like to extend it and
 
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
leave it where we have three strikes and
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
you're out
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay but I also don't want to screw the
 
00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:56.700 align:start position:0%
whole process up so that nothing gets
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
done so so if I understand correctly Mr
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
chairman what you're saying
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative Saxon is you're you'd
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
want to you would want to give the
 
00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
discretion to The Liquor Commission that
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
to be a little more severe that they
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
they could be so they could be very
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
severe with the first correct judgment
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
and revoke correct and or they could be
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
on the second but by the time you get to
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
the third we have nothing to do we are
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
saying by what we the action that we're
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
taking that the commission would be
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
mandated to revoke no extern extenuating
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances boom done on the third so
 
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
if one maybe two maybe three no maybe
 
00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:41.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah but just to to clarify that on
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
the third offense
 
00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
um just because something happened again
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be revoked they these Liquor
 
00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
Commission would still have to to
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
investigate and and yeah that all still
 
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
exists okay have we ever had a second
 
00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.829 align:start position:0%
exists okay have we ever had a second
offense

00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
so I guess I I I'm I'm I'm more apt to
 
00:59:09.839 --> 00:59:10.730 align:start position:0%
so I guess I I I'm I'm I'm more apt to
um

00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
if we
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
I mean if we've never had the second
 
00:59:17.089 --> 00:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
events then we would probably want to go
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
ahead with the revoking of it at a
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs you uh no I I
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I would not agree with that I
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
think there should I think the three
 
00:59:30.049 --> 00:59:30.059 align:start position:0%
things the tier
 
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
we don't know what's going to happen in
 
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
the future and I think it makes sense to
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
since we know that Liquor Commission
 
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
will investigate thoroughly they've made
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
that clear
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
to leave them
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
a number of different options that's
 
00:59:50.089 --> 00:59:50.099 align:start position:0%
what I would write okay so if we if we
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
liked if we're pro-choice here we like
 
00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:54.299 align:start position:0%
lots of three steps lots of options
 
00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
options would be
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
um that we think uh if the first
 
00:59:58.859 --> 01:00:00.230 align:start position:0%
um that we think uh if the first
violation

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
violation
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
should be up to up to five thousand and
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
up to 10 days
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
the second violation is up to ten
 
01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:14.770 align:start position:0%
the second violation is up to ten
thousand

01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:14.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
and uh it's one to two months or 30 to
 
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
now third
 
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
third violation is the revoke
 
01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.609 align:start position:0%
third violation is the revoke
but

01:00:28.609 --> 01:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
the governor on is and regardless if
 
01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
it's the first second or obviously the
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
third is a revolution either one in the
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
first or second if it is that a an
 
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
employee does not have the training
 
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
there's an automatic 30-day suspension
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
how does everybody think about that no
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
no no no no no go on after the third
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
three strikes no no nothing excuse me
 
01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter was one two or three
 
01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:01.140 align:start position:0%
regardless of one two or three if the
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
employee did not have training
 
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
so you're you're okay that this the
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
example we had today you know the for
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
this hearing that that that the worst
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
thing that could happen to that that
 
01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.089 align:start position:0%
thing that could happen to that that
business

01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
which I probably actually did happen was
 
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
that and we're guessing no they probably
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
they got fined up to 2500 because it was
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
the first violation
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
they got fined up to 2500 and they got
 
01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
suspended for 10 days but they hid the
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
sign in the back room you're okay with
 
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
that I'm saying that that is okay
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
because remember it's up to these
 
01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
amounts and it's the person wasn't
 
01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:44.089 align:start position:0%
amounts and it's the person wasn't
licensed

01:01:44.089 --> 01:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
um then obviously the fine should be
 
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
higher but I don't think that that in
 
01:01:50.329 --> 01:01:50.339 align:start position:0%
itself is a cause for revocation of a
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
license it has to be a totally
 
01:01:57.309 --> 01:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
out of a world type of offense
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
did I see your hand go up tell you
 
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you need to come to a mic
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure all the world wants to hear
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Mr chairman and members
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
is Mike Summers I'm the president CEO of
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
Association obviously we're quite keenly
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
interested in this bill so my concern
 
01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:24.059 align:start position:0%
with tier one no training automatic 30
 
01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:26.339 align:start position:0%
days automatic 30 days it's basically
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
you're just suspending the license the
 
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
business is not going to survive
 
01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
so uh at that point it's one strikey
 
01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
route so I would I would request
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that you consider
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
making it up to 30 days so that the
 
01:02:43.849 --> 01:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
commission has the ability to if it's a
 
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
more egregious occurrence then you you
 
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
bring the heat if it is something that
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know a terrible accident happened
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
whatever a fight bite breaks out in a
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
bar then in that incident instance uh
 
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
the commission has discretion uh based
 
01:02:59.210 --> 01:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
on a variety of factors but again with
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
the mitigating and aggravating factors I
 
01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
think you're almost forced to have the
 
01:03:04.609 --> 01:03:04.619 align:start position:0%
up to standard because I think that
 
01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
that's going to be required for them to
 
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
really do their work
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
and then the second violation is
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
automatic 30 to 60 days
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that's the current standard
 
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
so it kind of is and then uh 5 000 for
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
the first one ten thousand for the
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
second I I think we can live with that
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
yes again I think that's the current law
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
you probably could live with it well no
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
because I think the first offense is
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
2500 you know right updating those
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
amounts I think that is reasonable and
 
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate and again uh the nature of
 
01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
the story that was shared is just uh
 
01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
horrific but
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
um I guess the other thing that I would
 
01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
share with you just as you as you
 
01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
contemplate this piece of legislate you
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
know please recall in the state of New
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a lot of family-owned
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
businesses that have been here for 75
 
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
years or more so when you talk about one
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
two three strikes I mean that could
 
01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
literally the way this is drafted in my
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
understanding is this could really be
 
01:03:58.490 --> 01:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
spread out over 75 years but you could
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
still have your license suspended so I
 
01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
don't know how you address that but I
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
just I I give you that put that out that
 
01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
that is a caveat right okay thank you
 
01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:09.059 align:start position:0%
thank you very much does anybody has
 
01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
specific questions to him no okay okay
 
01:04:17.650 --> 01:04:17.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mike we do have a question
 
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
not for him okay thank you okay so I
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
want to before I take questions I want
 
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
to have Mark come back and Danielle
 
01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:32.299 align:start position:0%
so what we're look playing now with is
 
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
the the first
 
01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
is to be up to five thousand so we're
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
and up to 30 days so that gives the
 
01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
I guess we could say we say uh yeah well
 
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
in terms of whether it should say 25 to
 
01:04:55.609 --> 01:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
5 but or whether we just say up to 10
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
about to five for that first violation
 
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
would you rather have the 25 floor still
 
01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.849 --> 01:05:07.859 align:start position:0%
yeah a range a range is preferable
 
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
because it gives us so for first
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
violation 25
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
to 5.
 
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman before we start going
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
on to the second and the third if we
 
01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:26.339 align:start position:0%
could just get clarity on the first okay
 
01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:28.140 align:start position:0%
what Clarity would you like Clarity here
 
01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
is I think I just heard
 
01:05:35.089 --> 01:05:35.099 align:start position:0%
that that if in an offense
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
in the Judgment of the commission under
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:42.299 align:start position:0%
up to five 25 to 5
 
01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
000 2500 to 5 000 in up to 30 days that
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
that up to that if the commission and
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
let's just use the the immediate case
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's in view with in all of our minds
 
01:05:55.609 --> 01:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
did you you might go for the 30 days you
 
01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
can't revoke but you can go to 30 days
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
what I think I just heard was 30 days is
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
going to shut the establishment down
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
which is tantamount to revocation now
 
01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
that that's a judgment and it doesn't
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that's going to happen
 
01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
but that's that and I don't mean to
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
suggest it to test it's snowing we just
 
01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
heard is inaccurate but uh up to 30 days
 
01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
if it's tantamount to revocation why
 
01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:27.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
obviously if you're
 
01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
if you own 10 locations
 
01:06:36.529 --> 01:06:36.539 align:start position:0%
Closing one down for 30 days is it it's
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
not not that's not the end it's not at
 
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
the end so that again now you're just
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
taking consideration the size of the
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
nature of the business so because
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
earlier on we were talking about making
 
01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
revocation optional on the first offense
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
in the second offense right while making
 
01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
it mandatory on the third but that seems
 
01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
so I I guess yeah so let's that how
 
01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
about if we go to the 25 to 5 and then
 
01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
say up to 15 days except if there's an
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
employee if the employee didn't have the
 
01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.289 align:start position:0%
employee if the employee didn't have the
training

01:07:09.289 --> 01:07:09.299 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
the 30 day
 
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
and just go and then instead of going
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
the 30 days ago 15 days you know go back
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
to this or 10 days which is the current
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
law right the 10 days is the current law
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
so if we go back to current the current
 
01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
law 10 10 days so no revocation so no no
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
the revocation the Draconian revocation
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
occurs uh level at if you had three
 
01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.270 align:start position:0%
occurs uh level at if you had three
offenses

01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman can I add yeah just for
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
clarification uh because I know
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
everybody analytically is trying to put
 
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
this together in their heads just to
 
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative Terry's uh point this
 
01:07:58.370 --> 01:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't preclude due process there will
 
01:08:00.529 --> 01:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
be due process there's a hearing that
 
01:08:00.539 --> 01:08:01.789 align:start position:0%
be due process there's a hearing that
triggers

01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
triggers
 
01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:03.380 align:start position:0%
in 10 days
 
01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
after this is implemented number one
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
number two is we only have control of
 
01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:11.750 align:start position:0%
number two is we only have control of
liquor

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol in these establishments that
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
does not close them down for selling
 
01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:18.950 align:start position:0%
does not close them down for selling
food

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
food
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
so they still stay open which has been
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
which has been a point of contention
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting point they still
 
01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
stay open it's just they can't they
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative post do you have a
 
01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.390 align:start position:0%
okay representative post do you have a
comment

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
um no that was sort of what I was
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
um and I I think that's uh uh rep sphere
 
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
just uh proposed the 30 days I think
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
that would be with them being able to
 
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
serve and not being closed down
 
01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
um I think to 30 days is a better option
 
01:08:57.179 --> 01:08:58.849 align:start position:0%
um I think to 30 days is a better option
okay

01:08:58.849 --> 01:08:58.859 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative Burroughs
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify so if we do 30
 
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
days do you have discretion not to take
 
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
it up to 30 days on the first one wait
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
if we do this correct if it's up to then
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
in theory the suspension would be 0 to
 
01:09:18.169 --> 01:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gibbs
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
okay are we talking up to 30 days
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
if there is training or up to 30 days if
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
there is no training what we were
 
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
looking at uh it had nothing to do with
 
01:09:35.329 --> 01:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
training at this point with the training
 
01:09:37.249 --> 01:09:37.259 align:start position:0%
is it's it's sort of like but don't we
 
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
hang them out there I I still think that
 
01:09:41.329 --> 01:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
that's where that's what the intent of
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
the legislation was but I I did not
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
realize that a that they had this tier
 
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
system and B is that it's time for that
 
01:09:51.169 --> 01:09:51.179 align:start position:0%
whole rulemaking process to be Revisited
 
01:09:51.179 --> 01:09:52.669 align:start position:0%
whole rulemaking process to be Revisited
so

01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
um what I'm suggesting is that I think
 
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
we still do want to make a
 
01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:58.130 align:start position:0%
we still do want to make a
differentiation

01:09:58.130 --> 01:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
differentiation
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
between when there has been training and
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
when there has not been trained right
 
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
right but we if in that case we would
 
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
say taking in what is the current rules
 
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
the current what is the current
 
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
situation and where do we we're stepping
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
in and saying uh this fight you know
 
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
putting in this this penalty if I could
 
01:10:22.729 --> 01:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
say something so training is in the
 
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
aggravating and mitigating factors it's
 
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
already it's already an aggravating or
 
01:10:30.189 --> 01:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
mitigating those are required to be
 
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
considered when looking at penalties so
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
when you have a range it allows for the
 
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
aggravating and mitigating factors if
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
you have a significant amount of
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
mitigating factors you can receive
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
penalties on the lower end of the range
 
01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
if you have a significant amount of
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
aggravating factors right you can
 
01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
receive higher here's the reason why I
 
01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:50.540 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that and that is
 
01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
that most of the times these are
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
first-time offenses
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay that even if it's mitigating
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
the penalty is not severe enough
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's the penalty right that's
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
where I'm stepping in and saying
 
01:11:04.679 --> 01:11:06.050 align:start position:0%
where I'm stepping in and saying
legislatively

01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
legislatively
 
01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
that we want we want to do correct we
 
01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
want to do something so even if we were
 
01:11:12.130 --> 01:11:12.140 align:start position:0%
just to leave the way things are now
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
okay and that we still think that if the
 
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
person did not have training whether
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's first second you know violation
 
01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
well the second doesn't matter because
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
second you're going to get suspended for
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
30 days anyways so really what we're
 
01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
only talking about is the first
 
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.689 align:start position:0%
only talking about is the first
violation

01:11:29.689 --> 01:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
violation
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
if the employee did not have training
 
01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
what you know is 30 days appropriate now
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
given that the restaurant can still stay
 
01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.350 align:start position:0%
given that the restaurant can still stay
open

01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
so effectively then I I don't mean to be
 
01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
argumentative here or to we're trying to
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
get to conclusion together but but
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
effectively then what we're saying is
 
01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
that in the case that's immediately in
 
01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:57.590 align:start position:0%
that in the case that's immediately in
view

01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
view
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
that that the value of that human life
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
that has been lost because of the shall
 
01:12:06.729 --> 01:12:06.739 align:start position:0%
I say the negligence of the
 
01:12:09.729 --> 01:12:09.739 align:start position:0%
establishment's owner to not require
 
01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
training or to make sure that the
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
employee did not follow the appropriate
 
01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
training was a 30-day suspension to be
 
01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
able to serve liquor that's the and
 
01:12:21.169 --> 01:12:21.179 align:start position:0%
because the Public's going to look at
 
01:12:23.689 --> 01:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
this in in such a way and they're going
 
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
to say well they basically just said
 
01:12:30.490 --> 01:12:30.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's a way of looking at it so there's
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
well okay so let me cut to the cut to
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
the chase so the question then is should
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
we say instead of for the first
 
01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
violation it's 10 days so we just simply
 
01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
say up to 30 days given that that is a
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
considered mitigating Factor
 
01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
or do we want to articulate in the
 
01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
statute that the 30 days is because of
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
that's what I think in other words if we
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
just leave the world alone leave this
 
01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:08.420 align:start position:0%
Byzantine structure that they have alone
 
01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
all we want to say articulate is it
 
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter first second or third you
 
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
know that because was sick really second
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
or third it just means it really is
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
going after that first violation that if
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
somebody dies then yeah you got you guys
 
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
can't serve liquor for 30 days because
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
your employees weren't trained
 
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
yes and then and then and then in
 
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
response to the public saying you just
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
all you did is revoke the license for 30
 
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
days we say there could be a whole host
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
of circumstances here that we could not
 
01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
see in advance but look at what we do on
 
01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
the second offense because we give the
 
01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
Opera the the the possibility of
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
revitation we have never had a second
 
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:56.209 align:start position:0%
revitation we have never had a second
offense

01:13:56.209 --> 01:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
offense
 
01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
in all these years we've never had one
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
so we never that problem never occurred
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
I understand the reason why this bill is
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
in front of us is what happens if that
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
first offense is so catastrophic and
 
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
we're saying 30 days and we're saying if
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
the employee didn't have the training
 
01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
and that's the value we're putting on
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
the life that was just lost that's
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
correct representative Jackson
 
01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.590 align:start position:0%
correct representative Jackson
so

01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
I think that's appropriate I want to
 
01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
recognize a comment that was made
 
01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
earlier and we've kind of skipped over
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
we have the issue in New Hampshire of
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
many of our restaurants are
 
01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.270 align:start position:0%
many of our restaurants are
intergenerational

01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
intergenerational
 
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
there are several that I can think of
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
that have been the same family for most
 
01:14:38.810 --> 01:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
of the last century
 
01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
and so as a consequence would it be
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable to add after when you get to
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
the second or third offense to say
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
within a like within a 15-year period
 
01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
otherwise you have the potential of
 
01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:56.149 align:start position:0%
otherwise you have the potential of
having

01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
something occur five years ago and
 
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
you're going to put somebody else out of
 
01:15:03.169 --> 01:15:03.179 align:start position:0%
business 15 years from now so much with
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
like a driver's license where you can
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
accumulate and your points run off
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
give it time that's my first 15 years
 
01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
would be good so I see your spirit but
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
let me get this address so have you ever
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
cons we ever considered a timeline are
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
we thinking that where that's being
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
written in role right now right now
 
01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.030 align:start position:0%
written in role right now right now
there's

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
again the rules are are all over the
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
place some require a look back of the
 
01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
entire violation history some are look
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
back of three years some have specific
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
standards of 24 months so we are trying
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
to clean that up in rule to say that how
 
01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay so now I'm going to do something
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
because you're working on these rules
 
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
and because the liquid commission often
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
takes the consideration of what this
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
is it possible that we just retain this
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
bill and you'll have these rules done by
 
01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
next September
 
01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
that we can revisit those rules and that
 
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
you will put in this 30-day suspension
 
01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:16.580 align:start position:0%
for the first
 
01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
offense and also put in something to
 
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
make sure that no business nobody that
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
there isn't some kind of expiration so
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't last forever is that possible
 
01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:28.940 align:start position:0%
okay represent a spear
 
01:16:31.729 --> 01:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
uh two two points and one of them I
 
01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
think nobody's going to like
 
01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
but one of the uh the idea of putting a
 
01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
limit between the time frames between
 
01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
the first and second
 
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not so sure I think I like that
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
because we don't know how many didn't
 
01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
get caught
 
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:48.780 align:start position:0%
and I know that's been set on driver's
 
01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
licenses as well
 
01:16:52.729 --> 01:16:52.739 align:start position:0%
they don't catch everybody
 
01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
but the that's another issue okay but
 
01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
you let you put the penalty down at 2500
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
to 5K that's the current uh right that
 
01:17:03.530 --> 01:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
was what I was going to propose for the
 
01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:05.219 align:start position:0%
first offense right that I do have a
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
problem with that's saying that we're
 
01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:08.460 align:start position:0%
not increasing the penalty in any real
 
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
way well it's right now it's first
 
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
offense is 2500. yeah I would like to
 
01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
bring it back up to 5000 which is what
 
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
you said a little while ago right okay
 
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
but which I don't think the restaurant
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
they were opposed to yeah they weren't
 
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
opposed to it okay Mr chairman this is
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
where I believe your institutional
 
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
history your longevity as chair of this
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
committee will come into play because
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
with respect to the question I'm about
 
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
to ask as well as the folks here from
 
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission and that is so
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're beginning to hear questions about
 
01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:39.659 align:start position:0%
look backs
 
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
all right we're talking about it up here
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of time frames and whatever and
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
now we're hearing that there are look
 
01:17:48.169 --> 01:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
backs in the rules they're considering
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
respect you're considering it or it is
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
there are certain parameters for certain
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
penalties it's existing correct there
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
are look back periods existing all right
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman because you have the
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
history here this fascinates me from the
 
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
standpoint of Statute and Rule making
 
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
right was it the ever the intent in
 
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
statute that rules be developed that
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
would take into account look back
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
periods rather than have it be in
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
statute uh I would say this is the first
 
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
time we have ever I've ever dealt this
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
deeply into these penalties so this
 
01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
might so every other time we've ever had
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
these bills this issue uh look backs it
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
never came up because I never like
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
frankly I didn't know what the fines the
 
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
first second or third tier all the
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm not supposed to mention
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
names too often but the certain
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative that people know who's
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
put this bill in multiple times it was
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
always about mandating training up front
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
it was for all employees to be no I
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
don't mean this to be at all a critical
 
01:18:54.649 --> 01:18:54.659 align:start position:0%
or judgmental because I'm in a
 
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:57.659 align:start position:0%
fact-finding mode right now so what you
 
01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
folks do with respect to look backs is
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
not because you necessarily understood
 
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
that this was the intent of the law or
 
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
the specific language of the law because
 
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
there is no specific language in the law
 
01:19:11.209 --> 01:19:11.219 align:start position:0%
but would you consider prudent and
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable and so you just did that on a
 
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
discretionary basis correct so stat
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
their statute requires us to create
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
rules based on
 
01:19:27.169 --> 01:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
um a enforcement policy and rules around
 
01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:28.910 align:start position:0%
um a enforcement policy and rules around
penalties

01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
and it's only set the max penalties as
 
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
the five thousand dollar fine and then
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
it says that rules around suspension
 
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
revocation things like that so that's
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
what the in all the rules are based off
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
of the statutory requirement for us to
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
create rules regarding the enforcement
 
01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
policy of how we will handle penalties
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you okay yep okay representative
 
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
Wilson do you have a question
 
01:19:57.890 --> 01:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
yes I would hope that after retaining
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
that the verbiage would be much like
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
what representative spear said it's much
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
firmer not this up to I would like to
 
01:20:09.709 --> 01:20:09.719 align:start position:0%
see the first offense be a solid 5000 or
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
you know something that is very
 
01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
definitive I'd say start at five
 
01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
thousand and same with the days
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
that it's a firm 30 days not up to
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
do you agree with that or do you do you
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
prefer a wiggle room I think the
 
01:20:29.209 --> 01:20:29.219 align:start position:0%
commission has always remained neutral
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
on on these issues and left it up to the
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
committee to to actually put forth the
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
rules that we follow on a daily basis I
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
will say that in your history and your
 
01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:45.260 align:start position:0%
you know logic says that deterrence
 
01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
deterrents are there as was mentioned
 
01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
earlier with time being solidified and
 
01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
fines being solidified
 
01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
That's History
 
01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
he's the president thank you candidate
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
he has to be careful
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
well Mr chairman the other thing that Mr
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
chairman with respect to Mr
 
01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to representative Walsh's
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion here or request this also
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
plays in the in the favor of the
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
commission because there's no as he as
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
you and others are describing this
 
01:21:18.729 --> 01:21:18.739 align:start position:0%
wiggle room
 
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh 10 up to you know 10 on to 30 or 2500
 
01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
to 5 000 or whatever so if anybody's
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
really upset about whatever fine or
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
sanctions or levied shall we say
 
01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
whatever sanctions are levied if there's
 
01:21:35.209 --> 01:21:35.219 align:start position:0%
no wiggle room the commission can say
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
well you go blame the legislature
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
because that's what they passed rather
 
01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.090 align:start position:0%
because that's what they passed rather
than

01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
um blame us because we were too harsh
 
01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
within a certain range of 10 to 30 days
 
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
so we're the ones who take the Heat and
 
01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
not the commission
 
01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
and that's why we get the big bucks so
 
01:21:56.689 --> 01:21:56.699 align:start position:0%
if we were to retain this Bill yes uh we
 
01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
would have the expectation that the
 
01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
department would have their new rule
 
01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
which they would be working with the
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
interested parties in generating that
 
01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
rule okay so they would have a new rule
 
01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:09.649 align:start position:0%
rule okay so they would have a new rule
ready

01:22:09.649 --> 01:22:09.659 align:start position:0%
ready
 
01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would dare say don't have
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
to send it to rules committee before you
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
you bring it to us first and but it
 
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
would we would meet uh and we can we
 
01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
have we can meet in the summer or week
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
in September we have a summer deadline
 
01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
right now that we internal deadline for
 
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
the 600 girls which are the entire
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
penalty structure you have a summer you
 
01:22:33.530 --> 01:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
have a summer sun you've got it we're
 
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
hoping to have a first draft on by
 
01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
Summer Okay so theoretically when the
 
01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
first draft is done
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
um this this committee I I do have the
 
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
authority even though we don't aren't
 
01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
allowed to meet in July and August but I
 
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
could have the authority to call the
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and to review those uh
 
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
amendment that Amendment and see where
 
01:22:55.850 --> 01:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
we're at and um and but if nothing else
 
01:22:57.649 --> 01:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
if things are not getting resolved and
 
01:22:59.570 --> 01:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
people don't you know feel one way or
 
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
the other come by October we would have
 
01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
to have the bill out of committee so we
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
would have something by then but by
 
01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
retaining it at least then we get that
 
01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
negotiating process and I think that
 
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
you've gotten huge amount of guidance
 
01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
today and so therefore you know what you
 
01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
know where sort of where we're we're
 
01:23:22.970 --> 01:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
looking at so retirement with respect to
 
01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
your proposal and the disclosure of
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
Summer I'm wondering if you can be any
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
more definitive about that because
 
01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
Summer goes for three months from the
 
01:23:34.729 --> 01:23:34.739 align:start position:0%
middle of June to the middle of
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
September so are you able to provide any
 
01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
any more certainty within that time
 
01:23:41.689 --> 01:23:41.699 align:start position:0%
range you could go up right as soon as
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
they have it done they'll mail it to us
 
01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
right so we're not we don't want to wait
 
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
until their deadline you have a goal we
 
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
want to weigh in before the deadline
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's true so so in other words once
 
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
they've got some rough draft of what
 
01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
they do what's your hope our hope is I
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
would say July AI at this point okay we
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
have we have drafts but these are
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
connected with the 200 rules so we had
 
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
to write the 200 rules okay so not
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
September 20th okay thank you
 
01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
in representative just to add a little
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
bit more to that these uh this point
 
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
system that has shown in its uh infant
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
stages to be very fair to industry has
 
01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
been presented nationally and gotten
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
higher claims so we I think everybody at
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
least here knows and and I know industry
 
01:24:32.270 --> 01:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
knows that
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
um we we are thinking about them when
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
when we look at accountability and we
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
think about some of the things that were
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
brought up by Mr Summers that is is very
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
valid uh as far as just
 
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
that Mom and Pop own uh establishment
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
for years
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
um we understand that and and we want to
 
01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
see them in compliance
 
01:25:00.649 --> 01:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
be be very successful
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
okay so uh for discussion representative
 
01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
patusek has withdrawn as a motion and
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
his new motion is for retaining and
 
01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
that'll be second by me representative
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
purcelli yes thank you
 
01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
um and I appreciate that we're going to
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
retain it so we could look at the rules
 
01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
that's great but the original problem
 
01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
that I think we're trying to address is
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
the concept of training so I would like
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
to over the course of your evaluation of
 
01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
the rules separately I'd like to see
 
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.719 align:start position:0%
maybe working with the industry if there
 
01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
are any improvements or issues with the
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
training that have been reported
 
01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
anecdotally so I think the a rigorous
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
training program as you've described is
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
great but if the server is not making
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
good judgment that really is the problem
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to solve so how do we
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that servers are doing the
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
right thing and they feel comfortable
 
01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
with the decisions that they're making
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
at the you know busy time of operating
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
their business so I'd like to see some
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
type of report or evaluation working
 
01:26:12.169 --> 01:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
with the industry since we did have
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
these anecdotal messages that the
 
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
training was not comprehensive or
 
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:18.780 align:start position:0%
adequate and I'd like to understand that
 
01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
a little bit we have better training
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
maybe God forbid one life is too many
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
but maybe better training will yield
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
better results thank you representative
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
and and to that
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
um I will state that
 
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
um our training right now
 
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
um we we have a evaluation program that
 
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
we do after each one of them when
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative Terry brought that up
 
01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:45.890 align:start position:0%
representative Terry brought that up
earlier

01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
um there's no other term that that burns
 
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
through us because we set the bar so
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
high and and I know who you're speaking
 
01:26:58.669 --> 01:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
about and and that hasn't been brought
 
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
up the only time it's been brought up is
 
01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
with you sir so I I want to talk to that
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
licensee personally to find out where
 
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
we're falling short or where they're in
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
their minds where we fall short because
 
01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:14.219 align:start position:0%
I I haven't heard that but I appreciate
 
01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
your candidness on it and and
 
01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
representative I appreciate you bringing
 
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
that up um you both are not members of
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee so obviously this is
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
this issue is way from being solved
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
you don't know my problem yet
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
no it's a bigger problem
 
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's a real big problem so it might it
 
01:27:39.169 --> 01:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
as is pointed out to me by
 
01:27:42.850 --> 01:27:42.860 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
that you can only make rules based on
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
the current statute
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
so what we would uh I don't know how
 
01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
this would be but obviously you never
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
don't take an opinion mostly when it
 
01:27:59.689 --> 01:27:59.699 align:start position:0%
comes to legislation but in this case we
 
01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
are asking you to uh keep in mind in
 
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
terms of this rule change that uh you
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
where we would need a statutory change
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
to make that work
 
01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.510 align:start position:0%
to make that work
okay

01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:16.729 --> 01:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
how about that
 
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
how about representative did I answer
 
01:28:21.169 --> 01:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
it's a quick question okay thank you
 
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
um uh there's mention of Consulting with
 
01:28:30.649 --> 01:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in drafting the new rules
 
01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh could that include consultation with
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth croak's family as
 
01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:39.719 align:start position:0%
representatives of all those who have
 
01:28:42.169 --> 01:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
lost family members under these
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances so that they know that
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
their concerns are being addressed
 
01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:48.850 align:start position:0%
their concerns are being addressed
absolutely

01:28:48.850 --> 01:28:48.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
and given uh Mr croak David uh who
 
01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
testified before you
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
um I had been uh up to the first of the
 
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
year because we knew this was coming
 
01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
down the road
 
01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
um week weekly probably at the least
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
every two weeks conversations with him
 
01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:14.219 align:start position:0%
um during his his daughter's the case
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
his daughter was a victim of so that
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
that is common for us to do I I thank
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
you for acknowledging that we think
 
01:29:23.570 --> 01:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
that's good business to bring all
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in involved to get best
 
01:29:26.159 --> 01:29:29.770 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in involved to get best
practices

01:29:29.770 --> 01:29:29.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.649 --> 01:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
okay everybody happy okay uh the motion
 
01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
representative patusek second by
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative hunt this is just for the
 
01:29:38.930 --> 01:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members all those in favor
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
of retaining please raise your hand
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six
 
01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
and who am I miss who and I lost
 
01:29:55.129 --> 01:29:55.139 align:start position:0%
Osborne and okay so it passes six is up
 
01:29:59.090 --> 01:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
six to zero okay Mr chairman um with
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
respect to the action that we've that
 
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee has just taken
 
01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
um I presume that this will carry with
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
the full committee would you
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
um and if you do this I'm I'm sorry
 
01:30:12.169 --> 01:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
because I'm I can't read your mind but
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
would you make sure that representative
 
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
Mooney knows what the reason you know
 
01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
for sure I will be talking to everybody
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
because we do not mean to be
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
disrespectful here or put this off no
 
01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get this right no she
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
will she will get uh I will give her all
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
the highlights and lowlights we're
 
01:30:32.209 --> 01:30:32.219 align:start position:0%
actually Alter Ego okay yeah all right
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative Yemen
 
01:30:36.410 --> 01:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
just following representative Terry's
 
01:30:38.530 --> 01:30:38.540 align:start position:0%
comment the governor wrote us a letter
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
about this bill so we might want to keep
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
the governor's office informed okay
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
all right well that was a little more
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
painful than I thought
 
01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:51.890 align:start position:0%
painful than I thought
okay

01:30:51.890 --> 01:30:51.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:52.790 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
all right so let's let's
 
01:30:58.250 --> 01:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
hopefully this one we can do this a
 
01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
little faster
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
all right so I want to do right now I
 
01:31:04.570 --> 01:31:04.580 align:start position:0%
want to do 465.
 
01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
and I will I I would like to uh make a
 
01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
motion to retain it
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
second and um and I will speak to my
 
01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:20.090 align:start position:0%
second and um and I will speak to my
motion

01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.649 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:31:21.649 --> 01:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:31:21.659 --> 01:31:24.229 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
so this bill is sort of deja vu for me
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
and that is many years ago we had the
 
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
issue of bovine growth hormones uh and
 
01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh in in milk and this is a similar to
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
pfas was that there was no direct
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
correlation that that because there was
 
01:31:45.649 --> 01:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
great hormones you you know it's going
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
to cause this or that you know that
 
01:31:50.530 --> 01:31:50.540 align:start position:0%
because that there was something no no
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
the Food and Drug Administration uh
 
01:31:58.129 --> 01:31:58.139 align:start position:0%
would had had problems when with trying
 
01:32:00.649 --> 01:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
to regulate it and do something this
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
legislature actually over a period of
 
01:32:05.290 --> 01:32:05.300 align:start position:0%
almost six years had a bill each year
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
struggling with this issue the end
 
01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
result was that that
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
um a uh it was permitted for a built
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
milk manufacturer to write on their
 
01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:20.810 align:start position:0%
milk manufacturer to write on their
packaging

01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
packaging
 
01:32:24.410 --> 01:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
bovine growth hormone free
 
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
and therefore that too the result was
 
01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
now consumers can make that choice of
 
01:32:33.169 --> 01:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
whether they want to buy that product or
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
not in terms of the bovine growth
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
hormone and I pretty much I don't I I
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't see anything on packaging I still
 
01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
see uh bovine growth hormone-free in
 
01:32:46.490 --> 01:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
packaging okay so I think that we can
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
solve this issue and because clearly
 
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
people don't understand
 
01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
pfas and how what's going on with pfas
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
and where what what has pfas in it you
 
01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
know we've had this bill in another case
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
in resolution identity bill which is
 
01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
um that to ban pfas being sold but HHS
 
01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
says well we don't that's that is a
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
burden we it's very difficult I mean I
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
see the guys left the room but he was
 
01:33:18.890 --> 01:33:18.900 align:start position:0%
here so that it's really hard to do that
 
01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:20.030 align:start position:0%
here so that it's really hard to do that
so

01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:22.139 align:start position:0%
um what we need to do is figure out a
 
01:33:27.410 --> 01:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
way to have carpet retailers if that's
 
01:33:29.450 --> 01:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
that's the focus group we're working on
 
01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
but it could be expanded to any industry
 
01:33:35.689 --> 01:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
that has it that to have some way to uh
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
have them Focus to making sure marketing
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
wise that they are educating the
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
consumer that the product is is pfast
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
free or not representative Sullivan
 
01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr chairman I I
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
agree with the idea of trying to use the
 
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
market to motivate
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
decision making I think your analogy to
 
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
the bovine is not a Perfect Analogy in
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
that somebody consuming milk with bovine
 
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
growth hormone it's in their body and
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's just there and I think the
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
argument here is that there might be a
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
market failure even in the presence of
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
this additional information because you
 
01:34:14.209 --> 01:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
have an externality of
 
01:34:16.129 --> 01:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
the leachate in the dumps going into
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
local Waters supplies and I think that's
 
01:34:20.810 --> 01:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
the the intent of this bill and so I
 
01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:21.950 align:start position:0%
the the intent of this bill and so I
think

01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
what you're saying might might be a
 
01:34:25.729 --> 01:34:25.739 align:start position:0%
helpful it would certainly be better
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
than nothing but I don't think it gets
 
01:34:28.970 --> 01:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
at the intent of this bill so that's
 
01:34:30.890 --> 01:34:30.900 align:start position:0%
just my thought but
 
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
um I know that this bill has been turned
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
into that issue I would have to say is
 
01:34:35.159 --> 01:34:36.770 align:start position:0%
into that issue I would have to say is
boy

01:34:36.770 --> 01:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
boy
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
just start saying now we're going to
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
stop carpets from selling that pfas in
 
01:34:42.239 --> 01:34:43.669 align:start position:0%
stop carpets from selling that pfas in
it

01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:34:45.410 --> 01:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
the carp I think most people expect
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
their carpets to last 10 years
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
so that means they they the result of
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
that legislation doesn't have an impact
 
01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
until 10 years from now in terms of
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
solid waste dump so I would not use that
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
as a governor on this issue I would
 
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
think is more importantly we need to
 
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
educate consumers about pfas it might
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
let them be aware that how Insidious it
 
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
is and how where where it is and
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
therefore make make sure that they're
 
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
making choices to to uh ignore it but in
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
terms of the leech fields and septics
 
01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of the leech fields
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
and you know of
 
01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:28.930 align:start position:0%
and you know of
landfills

01:35:28.930 --> 01:35:28.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.729 --> 01:35:31.739 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's so many other things
 
01:35:33.169 --> 01:35:33.179 align:start position:0%
that be going in there right there's
 
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
mercury in there there's you know all
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
these other things that are that are
 
01:35:38.810 --> 01:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
poisonous that are in those Waters so
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
that's a whole separate issue that
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
people need to you know the terms of how
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to deal with that
 
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
leaking of of that which this pfas is
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
just a drop in the bucket frankly in
 
01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
terms of all the other things are
 
01:35:52.209 --> 01:35:52.219 align:start position:0%
leaching in the point of order
 
01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
represented spear yeah we're this is we
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
have a motion on the floor to retain
 
01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
this business this is discussion on on
 
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
the bill this is discussion this is only
 
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittee uh and this is
 
01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
actually I believe the ins I had it on
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
the insurance subcommittee
 
01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:11.159 align:start position:0%
no business this is the business
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so I think you're in the
 
01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:15.179 align:start position:0%
business subcommittee yeah no I just I
 
01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
thought we should vote I don't want to
 
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
we could spend an hour on the merits of
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
the retaining motion yeah right okay
 
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
right so you you you you're okay with
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:38.219 align:start position:0%
as a hazardous substance and or now in
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh negotiations to figure out how
 
01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to allow people to sue the
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
in a special fund for getting ill from
 
01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
pfest so the EPA has decided it is a
 
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
life-threatening cancer-causing drug
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
they have found two tests were were
 
01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
completed this summer linking absolutely
 
01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
linking pfas to several different kind
 
01:37:03.169 --> 01:37:03.179 align:start position:0%
of cancers and I can give you the
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
documentation no I understand that but
 
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
all you're doing is arguing why we
 
01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
should not be passing anything and we
 
01:37:10.729 --> 01:37:10.739 align:start position:0%
should wait to the EPA to does something
 
01:37:12.729 --> 01:37:12.739 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I said anything
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
we have to try point of order just
 
01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
letting it go doesn't solve anything
 
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
okay reporter should we I think we
 
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
should focus on whether we retain the
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
bill or not right and not have the
 
01:37:25.129 --> 01:37:25.139 align:start position:0%
hearing again so um
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that this is so important
 
01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.050 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that this is so important
to

01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
to do something now not to retain it not
 
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
to wait again people are getting sick
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
they're dying we have evidence of it so
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
I would like to take this to the floor
 
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
to let let the house decide what they
 
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
want to do with it and and I as I said
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
before if this committee comes down 10
 
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
to 10 with a vote uh that means we're
 
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
sending it with no recommendation and
 
01:37:52.129 --> 01:37:52.139 align:start position:0%
then we're going to have that circus
 
01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:54.179 align:start position:0%
that we had yesterday
 
01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
I guarantee you that's what's going to
 
01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:57.830 align:start position:0%
I guarantee you that's what's going to
happen

01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.110 align:start position:0%
happen
okay

01:37:59.110 --> 01:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
so all I'm saying is that if I would
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
much rather us be the bill doesn't even
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
have the has an effective date that's
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
three years out
 
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
so if it doesn't really matter whether
 
01:38:12.050 --> 01:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
we get it out of committee now or versus
 
01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
getting out of committee in January it's
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
still long before the effective date I'm
 
01:38:18.290 --> 01:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
just saying is that wouldn't it be
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
better if something that we can all
 
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
agree on and get behind rather than
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
having having everybody argue over pfas
 
01:38:28.490 --> 01:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
for 10 15 half an hour you know back and
 
01:38:30.770 --> 01:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
forth lay it on the table oh gets pulled
 
01:38:32.090 --> 01:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
off the table
 
01:38:34.729 --> 01:38:34.739 align:start position:0%
I mean none of us wait I don't know you
 
01:38:36.770 --> 01:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
guys but I think it could pass
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh that's fine I'm just saying is that
 
01:38:45.410 --> 01:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
if if it barely passes like that on this
 
01:38:47.149 --> 01:38:47.159 align:start position:0%
current do you think you've got the
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
votes on the Senate side
 
01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
okay I mean do you think you have the
 
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
governor who's gonna you know I'm just
 
01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
saying that's that
 
01:38:58.990 --> 01:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
there I understand how important this is
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
I do understand but at the same time you
 
01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
have an effective date that's pushed so
 
01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
far out why are we rushing something
 
01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
that's only going to be a legislative
 
01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
Nightmare on the floor uh let alone it's
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
you know it's just it's basically my
 
01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
problem is is that we want to send a
 
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
good clear message that everybody can
 
01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:22.739 align:start position:0%
appreciate if this whole idea of that
 
01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
we've got this 10 10 this this you know
 
01:39:27.649 --> 01:39:27.659 align:start position:0%
legislature that's so even
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
yes that means is whatever comes out
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
whatever happens is going to be ugly
 
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
because it's it was
 
01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
literally voted on by one vote okay I
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
think you said the two magic words
 
01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
Senate Governor so
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
um if you if if there is a commitment
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
from both sides to really come up with a
 
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
solution I could go with retain okay I
 
01:39:52.129 --> 01:39:52.139 align:start position:0%
mean not just meet 15 minutes in next
 
01:39:54.649 --> 01:39:54.659 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely we want to think of
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
ideas and how we can communicate and get
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
give it an opportunity for businesses to
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
to address that you know whether the
 
01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
pfas is in what they're selling
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
and that's really it and it's not just
 
01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
carpets right well we wanted to start
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere but again as I said if there's
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
a commitment to really come up with a
 
01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
solution then then um and how would we
 
01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
do that I mean do you would you call
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
meetings in the summer I mean well we
 
01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
what I in September we would have a
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on the bill
 
01:40:24.050 --> 01:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
and and yeah we were we would be letting
 
01:40:26.450 --> 01:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
people out give us some ideas on what we
 
01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
can help New Hampshire businesses and
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
try to you know address this issue so
 
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
that pfas is not being sold in New
 
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire without the consumer knowing
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
what they're buying okay
 
01:40:37.679 --> 01:40:40.790 align:start position:0%
what they're buying okay
well

01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
I all the more reason why you're in my
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
mind if California has really banned it
 
01:40:52.010 --> 01:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
dense Den why would it be sold in New
 
01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's my point okay all right so
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
the motion which which subcommittee did
 
01:41:06.110 --> 01:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
business this was the business committee
 
01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
all right so who's on the business
 
01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:10.570 align:start position:0%
all right so who's on the business
committee

01:41:10.570 --> 01:41:10.580 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
Ammon Cole Thaxton hunt McAleer Herbert
 
01:41:21.490 --> 01:41:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.649 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:41:23.649 --> 01:41:23.659 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
right cool who's out he's here yes
 
01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:33.890 align:start position:0%
right cool who's out he's here yes
Robert

01:41:33.890 --> 01:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.530 --> 01:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
so I have one two three four five six
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
people are here all those in favor were
 
01:41:52.330 --> 01:41:52.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.930 --> 01:41:55.940 align:start position:0%
okay then I need to uh appoint
 
01:41:59.930 --> 01:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
Replacements or every I mean okay so you
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to retain it you what do you
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
want to do with it
 
01:42:05.930 --> 01:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
we can't pass it in its current form
 
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
because I'm saying why would you want to
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
put that on the floor when you know it's
 
01:42:15.370 --> 01:42:15.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:18.609 --> 01:42:18.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:23.209 --> 01:42:23.219 align:start position:0%
so the vote is to retain those in favor
 
01:42:27.370 --> 01:42:27.380 align:start position:0%
retaining please raise your hand one two
 
01:42:32.590 --> 01:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
three four okay those opposed
 
01:42:42.410 --> 01:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:46.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
all right the last one last but not
 
01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:52.390 align:start position:0%
all right the last one last but not
least

01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
a house bill 639 all right so I assume
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
the audiences has plenty of time to read
 
01:43:05.890 --> 01:43:05.900 align:start position:0%
it over
 
01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a problem with it so
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
far or anything that needs to you know
 
01:43:13.010 --> 01:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
tell us speak now forevermore hold your
 
01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
peace till it gets to finance and then
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:43:24.290 --> 01:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
state your name good morning Mr chair
 
01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
Timothy Egan chair of New Hampshire can
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
the trade Advisory Group for the
 
01:43:31.729 --> 01:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
Cannabis industry uh we're very happy
 
01:43:33.169 --> 01:43:33.179 align:start position:0%
that there seems to be a lot of
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
listening being done by this committee
 
01:43:39.169 --> 01:43:39.179 align:start position:0%
to the effort of State entities to want
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
to move this bill forward but we did
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
notice there were two issues that could
 
01:43:47.810 --> 01:43:47.820 align:start position:0%
avert a well-run
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
cannabis industry
 
01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
there seems to be uh any Advisory board
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
that comes with professional insight
 
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
into the industry not in the bill as
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
well a concern that there are no
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
caps on the number of licenses one
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
entity could own therefore restricting
 
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
what could be uh individual run Commerce
 
01:44:13.729 --> 01:44:13.739 align:start position:0%
in the State uh the concern that big
 
01:44:15.890 --> 01:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
cannabis could come in and take over our
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
industry those are the two things that
 
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
collectively I think were missing there
 
01:44:25.609 --> 01:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
could be thought about along the way but
 
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
unless I'm
 
01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:30.050 align:start position:0%
unless I'm
not

01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:44:31.609 --> 01:44:31.619 align:start position:0%
missing anything else I think I'm
 
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
speaking for six or seven or eight
 
01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
different organizations that have
 
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
collectively tried to work together with
 
01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
you all on this bill those are our two
 
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
questions of why they were removed well
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'll take I'll take the blame
 
01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
um the two reasons I the the terms of
 
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
The Advisory board and the purpose of
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
um I I mean I I
 
01:45:00.649 --> 01:45:00.659 align:start position:0%
adding another level of bureaucracy
 
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
um is is one of the things that I I
 
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
personally and I think this committee
 
01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:07.860 align:start position:0%
generally tries to avoid
 
01:45:10.729 --> 01:45:10.739 align:start position:0%
so in those two issues that would be
 
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
Bureau bureaucracy
 
01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
um and consume in terms of what they're
 
01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:16.189 align:start position:0%
um and consume in terms of what they're
advising

01:45:16.189 --> 01:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
advising
 
01:45:17.689 --> 01:45:17.699 align:start position:0%
um I think that the Liquor Commission
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
when their rules and their rules
 
01:45:21.050 --> 01:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
hearings they'll have plenty of
 
01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity for anybody to come in and
 
01:45:26.209 --> 01:45:26.219 align:start position:0%
give them advice and and terms of
 
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
generating the rules so that there was
 
01:45:30.169 --> 01:45:30.179 align:start position:0%
no it's just like when we do study
 
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
committees do we think commission's a
 
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
good idea we have lots of Industry
 
01:45:35.689 --> 01:45:35.699 align:start position:0%
involved people or do we think it's
 
01:45:37.609 --> 01:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
better off just having House and Senate
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
members and then all those people who
 
01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:42.179 align:start position:0%
care or have an opinion will show up to
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
that meeting and be able to express
 
01:45:46.609 --> 01:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
their opinion and it just seems like
 
01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
it's a more efficient way to run
 
01:45:48.119 --> 01:45:49.609 align:start position:0%
it's a more efficient way to run
government

01:45:49.609 --> 01:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the licensing and trying
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
to control licensing that creates
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
winners and losers and that is
 
01:45:57.649 --> 01:45:57.659 align:start position:0%
absolutely an anathema to me and I'm
 
01:45:59.810 --> 01:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
pretty sure it's anathema to New
 
01:46:01.729 --> 01:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we we are not in the business
 
01:46:05.209 --> 01:46:05.219 align:start position:0%
of Taxi medallions you know limiting
 
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
licenses and limiting that stuff
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
um we're we're we actually believe that
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
if you're going to create something uh
 
01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
you want to give everybody the equal
 
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to get it and I realized
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
that that might mean there's uh you know
 
01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
that somebody is going to swallow
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
everybody up and there's consolidation
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
in the industry and um but at the end of
 
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
the day the New Hampshire way is to is
 
01:46:30.649 --> 01:46:30.659 align:start position:0%
to allow anybody and everybody to
 
01:46:33.649 --> 01:46:33.659 align:start position:0%
participate and not and not try to not
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
not try to pick winners and losers
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
um my apologies to make sure I was clear
 
01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
when I was talking about licensing
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
because it's not a total number of a cap
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
of licenses but that an individual
 
01:46:45.119 --> 01:46:47.810 align:start position:0%
of licenses but that an individual
business

01:46:47.810 --> 01:46:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
control number on the amount that any
 
01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
one business could own
 
01:46:57.050 --> 01:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
right well an example I can give you on
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
that is to take Massachusetts and how we
 
01:47:03.229 --> 01:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
tried to limit uh uh liquor licenses
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
and and I guess to the benefit to who
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
the packies package stores and they said
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
to grocery stores they started out you
 
01:47:12.050 --> 01:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
know started out you can only have six
 
01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:15.719 align:start position:0%
locations then they went to 12. and now
 
01:47:17.450 --> 01:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
I think they're up to 24. I know they
 
01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
keep they keep revisiting the issue okay
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
and so and when it comes uh that to me
 
01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
that's the the the first the first
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
mistake was when they put that limit way
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
back when and to say okay we want to
 
01:47:31.609 --> 01:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
have Packy Stores
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of what uh you know
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire's model has always
 
01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
been we aren't limiting how many
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
licenses anybody can have because that
 
01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
inevitably would uh create future
 
01:47:46.189 --> 01:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
legislation to have to fix that and so
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's better off just being fair up front
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
and one more comment if I may yes and
 
01:47:54.590 --> 01:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
that discussion around licenses would
 
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
come easier if an Advisory Board existed
 
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
because they would be able to assess
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
what are best practices in the industry
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
the idea of Advisory Board would be able
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
to look at neighboring states and the
 
01:48:09.169 --> 01:48:09.179 align:start position:0%
other 20 some odd states that do have
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
legal recreational cannabis and an
 
01:48:15.290 --> 01:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board does not come with fees
 
01:48:16.669 --> 01:48:16.679 align:start position:0%
and costs while it does come with
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
Insight it does come with a myriad of
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
expertise and I think we've I'm trying
 
01:48:23.090 --> 01:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
to Echo
 
01:48:26.330 --> 01:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
I guess my
 
01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
support and answers to questions by
 
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
folks in the Senate and in the corner
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
office about have we studied this
 
01:48:34.729 --> 01:48:34.739 align:start position:0%
industry and what can we bring to the
 
01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
table that would make the industry move
 
01:48:38.570 --> 01:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
smoother and being able to access
 
01:48:40.970 --> 01:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
experts that are in
 
01:48:45.169 --> 01:48:45.179 align:start position:0%
cannabis rehabilitative issues
 
01:48:47.330 --> 01:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
um you know Commerce all the different
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
facets that the industry touches being
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
able to give that support to an agency
 
01:48:54.050 --> 01:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
that is exploring something they've
 
01:48:56.330 --> 01:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
never explored before could be
 
01:48:58.609 --> 01:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the state and move our
 
01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
industry fast I don't know how it could
 
01:49:03.169 --> 01:49:03.179 align:start position:0%
be any different than alcohol I I the
 
01:49:05.209 --> 01:49:05.219 align:start position:0%
alcohol is we absolutely there are
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
plenty of people who think alcohol is a
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
bad thing and they absolutely have
 
01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
plenty of opportunity to show up to
 
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
rules meetings and and express that your
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
concerns and so in terms of you know
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
setting up who's going to be on this
 
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
advisory commission that becomes
 
01:49:21.590 --> 01:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
political in itself
 
01:49:25.010 --> 01:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
and and that's that you know no we I we
 
01:49:27.890 --> 01:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
want to avoid that in New Hampshire
 
01:49:30.050 --> 01:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
personally but maybe other members of
 
01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
the committee agree with you I don't
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
know how many other people agree with
 
01:49:35.149 --> 01:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
you but but I I just think that that in
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
terms of a product that comes out of
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
this committee we should be consistent
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
on what we have always traditionally
 
01:49:43.970 --> 01:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
believed when it comes to uh that you
 
01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
know that that no we don't we don't you
 
01:49:47.810 --> 01:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
know we we don't have an advisory
 
01:49:49.729 --> 01:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
committee Over The Liquor Commission to
 
01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:51.719 align:start position:0%
tell them you know how how to address
 
01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
these issues we have a lobbyist who's
 
01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
there taking care of that for them okay
 
01:49:58.850 --> 01:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
so that and yes she's she visits with
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission often and so I I
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to have a commission
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have to have that political
 
01:50:08.570 --> 01:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
entity uh to to express you know what we
 
01:50:10.609 --> 01:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
need or shouldn't it be doing
 
01:50:12.590 --> 01:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
I think we do have them at other
 
01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:14.090 align:start position:0%
I think we do have them at other
agencies

01:50:14.090 --> 01:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
some are more vocal than others right
 
01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:16.910 align:start position:0%
some are more vocal than others right
okay

01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:50:18.609 --> 01:50:18.619 align:start position:0%
not in this committee
 
01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
not regulated by this committee we have
 
01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
nobody telling insurance department how
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
they should be doing insurance we don't
 
01:50:25.609 --> 01:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
have any we don't have any commissions
 
01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
on banking we don't have any commission
 
01:50:29.629 --> 01:50:29.639 align:start position:0%
so so that you know creating a
 
01:50:31.010 --> 01:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
commission is the mathemat for this
 
01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:31.970 align:start position:0%
commission is the mathemat for this
committee

01:50:31.970 --> 01:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
so I'll let your other okay but I
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming in and expressing
 
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
that so in that way we can tell people
 
01:50:40.250 --> 01:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
we have heard this concerned and we end
 
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
we've like I said at the beginning we do
 
01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you this your
 
01:50:46.430 --> 01:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee your committee
 
01:50:49.010 --> 01:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
um Commerce have been listening to all
 
01:50:52.010 --> 01:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
of the facets of folks interested in
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
this industry and moving it forward so
 
01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
we do appreciate fair enough that okay
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else who representative
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
Osborne do you have a comment yeah I'll
 
01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
just uh comment on this point I I assure
 
01:51:06.410 --> 01:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
the concern of uh folks from the
 
01:51:08.090 --> 01:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
industry that they want to be
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative uh represented
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
my concern though around advisory boards
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
where you have appointed members though
 
01:51:18.169 --> 01:51:18.179 align:start position:0%
is those appointees
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily representing what
 
01:51:21.410 --> 01:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be representing
 
01:51:24.050 --> 01:51:24.060 align:start position:0%
they're representing uh the people who
 
01:51:26.689 --> 01:51:26.699 align:start position:0%
appointed them right so I feel like the
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
industry will be better represented if
 
01:51:31.129 --> 01:51:31.139 align:start position:0%
they choose their own members to come to
 
01:51:33.709 --> 01:51:33.719 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission to voice their
 
01:51:35.689 --> 01:51:35.699 align:start position:0%
concerns rather than having someone who
 
01:51:37.609 --> 01:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
allegedly represents them that may not
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily so fair enough
 
01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative Gibbs thank you
 
01:51:45.290 --> 01:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
um this is a question on a different on
 
01:51:50.930 --> 01:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
a different issue uh this is something
 
01:51:54.169 --> 01:51:54.179 align:start position:0%
that I noticed in reviewing the February
 
01:51:57.530 --> 01:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
8th uh version of the amendment I have
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
not had a chance to review today's
 
01:52:01.490 --> 01:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
version of the amendment and I want to
 
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
make it clear that this is a concern not
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
a deal breaker for me uh but my question
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
is I noticed um and this may have been
 
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
there in the earlier versions and I just
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
hadn't noticed it that there were
 
01:52:17.570 --> 01:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
references to limits on possession and
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
my question is why if we are legalizing
 
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh we're going to put limits on
 
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
possession when for instance
 
01:52:30.169 --> 01:52:30.179 align:start position:0%
um there we have no uh statutory limits
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh or so far as I know regulatory limits
 
01:52:35.689 --> 01:52:35.699 align:start position:0%
on the number of bottles of liquor that
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
an individual can possess
 
01:52:41.330 --> 01:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
so you're saying about this serving size
 
01:52:43.609 --> 01:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
you you would like to see limits on the
 
01:52:47.209 --> 01:52:47.219 align:start position:0%
serving sizes no I'm saying why would we
 
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
have why would we have limits at all on
 
01:52:53.149 --> 01:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
the amounts I I uh I think the limit is
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
at 20 didn't we just ended up was it
 
01:52:57.790 --> 01:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
what do we end up with
 
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
it's at 20 milligrams yeah yeah that
 
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
that was that's the high that's so
 
01:53:05.090 --> 01:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
that's the only limit we have is the
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
ultimate the high end but yes uh
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
theoretically the marketplace is free to
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
make it any sizes that they want it and
 
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
my question is why do we need those
 
01:53:18.109 --> 01:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
limits at all uh
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
I I uh well given that there was a lot
 
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
of political pressure to have more limit
 
01:53:26.330 --> 01:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
or lower limits it was a balancing of
 
01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:28.679 align:start position:0%
you know that taking uh taking what's
 
01:53:30.649 --> 01:53:30.659 align:start position:0%
going on in the marketplace now and the
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
high the highest that's out there was
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
the 20 and that's why we we did the 20.
 
01:53:36.290 --> 01:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you and I believe the atcs are at
 
01:53:40.129 --> 01:53:40.139 align:start position:0%
20. see atcs it is the ATC at 20 or is
 
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:50.689 --> 01:53:50.699 align:start position:0%
um so what representative is talking
 
01:53:52.970 --> 01:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
about if the personal possession limits
 
01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:54.109 align:start position:0%
about if the personal possession limits
right

01:53:54.109 --> 01:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
is the serving serving size right
 
01:54:07.390 --> 01:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
that that is that is my question so the
 
01:54:11.930 --> 01:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
answer to that is we don't want you to
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
buy so much that you feel compelled to
 
01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
reselling we don't want you to come in I
 
01:54:21.770 --> 01:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
mean it's a sort of it's a reason why
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
right you know the the uh how the Liquor
 
01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
Commission got a little hard time
 
01:54:28.129 --> 01:54:28.139 align:start position:0%
because uh evidently there was a uh a
 
01:54:31.729 --> 01:54:31.739 align:start position:0%
French uh Courvoisier that was in high
 
01:54:33.890 --> 01:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
demand and everybody was showing up to
 
01:54:35.930 --> 01:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
buy it in huge quantities here in New
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and clearly for the purpose of
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
reselling it in other states so so the
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
limits were set up to to ensure to try
 
01:54:45.290 --> 01:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
to minimize it I wouldn't say it's going
 
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
to make it go away because theoretically
 
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
those same people come up here with that
 
01:54:52.129 --> 01:54:52.139 align:start position:0%
truck visit several liquor stores before
 
01:54:54.410 --> 01:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
they leave the state so they up because
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
they they have that ten thousand dollar
 
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
cash requirement and so they didn't want
 
01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
to be recorded but uh so I guess that
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
would be the one Governor we have now is
 
01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
is nobody wants to hand over ten
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
thousand and one and then have to be
 
01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:08.030 align:start position:0%
thousand and one and then have to be
reported

01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
reported
 
01:55:11.149 --> 01:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
I remember that that discussion
 
01:55:11.159 --> 01:55:12.350 align:start position:0%
I remember that that discussion
um

01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
again I just wanted to bring this up yes
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
no I appreciate you bringing it up
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
because that was a good question
 
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.609 align:start position:0%
because that was a good question
okay

01:55:19.609 --> 01:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:55:23.689 --> 01:55:23.699 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
who'd like to be representative
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
um I was as quickly scanning through
 
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
this uh version here I know that the one
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
of the previous versions We had looked
 
01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
at there was a concern around the sale
 
01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:37.910 align:start position:0%
at there was a concern around the sale
of

01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
um water pipes things of that nature
 
01:55:43.129 --> 01:55:43.139 align:start position:0%
that are not necessarily cannabis
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
related would would this then turn those
 
01:55:47.930 --> 01:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
items into cannabis related products
 
01:55:50.890 --> 01:55:50.900 align:start position:0%
that would be regulated
 
01:55:54.590 --> 01:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
I do believe that paraphernalia is the
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
other word we would call it is is
 
01:55:58.970 --> 01:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
available the key thing was to add The
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
Vaping making sure we included vaping in
 
01:56:03.770 --> 01:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
it because that's another paraphernal
 
01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
device that might be used but I I cannot
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
imagine that you have a facility selling
 
01:56:11.770 --> 01:56:11.780 align:start position:0%
marijuana without without
 
01:56:14.570 --> 01:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
accoutrements that is correct but you
 
01:56:16.729 --> 01:56:16.739 align:start position:0%
might be selling accoutrement with uh
 
01:56:19.310 --> 01:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
without selling cannabis right and do we
 
01:56:21.050 --> 01:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
want to make those people get licenses
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden because they sell oh
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
that's the equation yes so uh that
 
01:56:28.189 --> 01:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
license was added in because it wasn't
 
01:56:29.930 --> 01:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
somewhat I mean in terms of what the
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
commission is that there are some very
 
01:56:34.370 --> 01:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
creative uses of some of that
 
01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
paraphernal so it's not necessarily the
 
01:56:39.050 --> 01:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
ones that would be but they are still
 
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
barred to sell it to anyone under 21.
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
so that it could be it could be some uh
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
device that was a
 
01:56:50.270 --> 01:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess what was the conversation
 
01:56:52.189 --> 01:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
we had was what happens if you're one of
 
01:56:53.770 --> 01:56:53.780 align:start position:0%
these Gift Stores
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
that you know sells just sells to
 
01:56:57.770 --> 01:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
tourists and you want to sell something
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
that might be perceived to be a
 
01:57:03.530 --> 01:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
marijuana device that that yes we're
 
01:57:05.209 --> 01:57:05.219 align:start position:0%
going to give them an opportunity to
 
01:57:07.609 --> 01:57:07.619 align:start position:0%
sell that but but they'll be licensed
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
and that license will ensure that we'll
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that they don't sell it to
 
01:57:13.250 --> 01:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
someone under 21.
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
that's why all right okay again so my
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
concern is the people who exist today so
 
01:57:20.570 --> 01:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
my my buddy who sells glassware uh is he
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
now going to have to have a license
 
01:57:23.689 --> 01:57:23.699 align:start position:0%
because of this uh yeah but the license
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
could be minimal it's a minimal license
 
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
yes if he's selling if he's selling
 
01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
marijuana you know devices they're the
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
devices that could be used for remember
 
01:57:34.609 --> 01:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
proceed to be then he's probably going
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
to want one of these license so that no
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
one you know that that he can then
 
01:57:42.530 --> 01:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
defend his business and not be accused
 
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
of being uh an underground marijuana I
 
01:57:48.169 --> 01:57:48.179 align:start position:0%
have a question yes Representative
 
01:57:51.050 --> 01:57:51.060 align:start position:0%
Vincent thank you Mr chairman so I just
 
01:57:53.330 --> 01:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
um just for clarity
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
um that's taking place today now without
 
01:57:58.490 --> 01:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
a license right that's taking place now
 
01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
so now you're saying that we're going to
 
01:58:02.089 --> 01:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
go ahead and make a license for that we
 
01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
are going to make a license for that yes
 
01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
so that again so we can pull it if they
 
01:58:12.050 --> 01:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:19.070 --> 01:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me my mic went off that the idea
 
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that that we that
 
01:58:27.530 --> 01:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
if someone is selling something that it
 
01:58:30.530 --> 01:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
could see that they are have the
 
01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
potential to sell it to someone under
 
01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
21. we don't we want them to do it so
 
01:58:37.129 --> 01:58:37.139 align:start position:0%
theoretically they they could not have
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
to buy the license it's not like the
 
01:58:40.370 --> 01:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement is going to go
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
knocking on you know go around looking
 
01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
for people it's more importantly is that
 
01:58:47.149 --> 01:58:47.159 align:start position:0%
if there was one that then the Liquor
 
01:58:49.129 --> 01:58:49.139 align:start position:0%
Commission can say that the person did
 
01:58:50.810 --> 01:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
register and get the license and I
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
respect that I just think that like for
 
01:58:56.450 --> 01:58:56.460 align:start position:0%
right now it's already exists it already
 
01:58:58.370 --> 01:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
happens I know there's a smoke shop or
 
01:58:59.930 --> 01:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it in Dover
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
um and uh they are by law I believe and
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
I don't don't quote me because I really
 
01:59:08.930 --> 01:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
don't know but I don't think they selled
 
01:59:11.330 --> 01:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
anybody under 21 if it goes so your
 
01:59:12.770 --> 01:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
preferences we take this out of the bill
 
01:59:15.410 --> 01:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
well I just think that just I think it
 
01:59:17.089 --> 01:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
would be right to take it out of the
 
01:59:18.890 --> 01:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
bill because I hate to go okay you've
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
done this for so many years okay now
 
01:59:22.010 --> 01:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to give you you need a
 
01:59:23.450 --> 01:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
license that's fine if you want to take
 
01:59:25.070 --> 01:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
it out of the bill but Danielle do you
 
01:59:34.910 --> 01:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:37.629 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:59:37.629 --> 01:59:37.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
talk to the mic sorry I'm sorry for so
 
01:59:44.930 --> 01:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis accessories
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
can automatically be sold by a retail
 
01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:49.089 align:start position:0%
can automatically be sold by a retail
cannabis

01:59:49.089 --> 01:59:49.099 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:59:49.099 --> 01:59:50.689 align:start position:0%
cannabis
licensee

01:59:50.689 --> 01:59:50.699 align:start position:0%
licensee
 
01:59:52.850 --> 01:59:52.860 align:start position:0%
there's also a provision in the end of
 
01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
the bill that allows those with a retail
 
01:59:59.629 --> 01:59:59.639 align:start position:0%
tobacco license to sell cannabis
 
02:00:01.850 --> 02:00:01.860 align:start position:0%
accessories and paraphernalia
 
02:00:04.490 --> 02:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
so those that are currently licensed as
 
02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
a retail tobacco would be grandfathered
 
02:00:09.169 --> 02:00:09.179 align:start position:0%
and they wouldn't need a new license the
 
02:00:13.729 --> 02:00:13.739 align:start position:0%
new license carves out the
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
um individuals or businesses who aren't
 
02:00:19.250 --> 02:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
currently selling those that want to
 
02:00:21.169 --> 02:00:21.179 align:start position:0%
start selling those they would then need
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
a license but for those that are
 
02:00:24.649 --> 02:00:24.659 align:start position:0%
currently in existence selling the
 
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
Cannabis accessories and paraphernalia
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
who I would say most of them have a
 
02:00:32.810 --> 02:00:32.820 align:start position:0%
retail tobacco license they're in the
 
02:00:34.550 --> 02:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
there's a modification to the definition
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
of the retail tobacco license that would
 
02:00:39.050 --> 02:00:39.060 align:start position:0%
would allow them to continue selling it
 
02:00:41.330 --> 02:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
without needing a new license so so if
 
02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
somebody right now is selling just
 
02:00:43.260 --> 02:00:45.709 align:start position:0%
somebody right now is selling just
glassware

02:00:45.709 --> 02:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
glassware
 
02:00:48.530 --> 02:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
if they're just glassware and they don't
 
02:00:50.689 --> 02:00:50.699 align:start position:0%
have a retail tobacco then they would
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
need the cannabis
 
02:00:55.490 --> 02:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
right so where is that because evidently
 
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
we have a move in to take it out of the
 
02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.010 align:start position:0%
we have a move in to take it out of the
bill

02:00:58.010 --> 02:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the Cannabis accessory
 
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
retailer yeah so where's that in the
 
02:01:04.189 --> 02:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
bill uh that is
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
um the back looks like the back of these
 
02:01:07.729 --> 02:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
Pages aren't numbered um back of page
 
02:01:07.739 --> 02:01:09.649 align:start position:0%
Pages aren't numbered um back of page
one

02:01:09.649 --> 02:01:09.659 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
but that would only be for those that
 
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
are just selling glassware that don't
 
02:01:17.209 --> 02:01:17.219 align:start position:0%
have a retail cannabis or a retail
 
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
tobacco yeah evidently these they don't
 
02:01:20.450 --> 02:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
want to have a license they don't they
 
02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:21.659 align:start position:0%
don't want to be required to get a
 
02:01:24.770 --> 02:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
license so so theoretically they're
 
02:01:27.290 --> 02:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
never going to sell marijuana
 
02:01:27.300 --> 02:01:30.550 align:start position:0%
never going to sell marijuana
device

02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:33.050 --> 02:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
they would have a cannabis selling
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
license right okay so if you're not
 
02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
selling if it's not for cannabis purpose
 
02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
then they don't need to get this license
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
at all right so there's no problem
 
02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
it's only if they decide they want to
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
make one or have one that is perceived
 
02:01:52.189 --> 02:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
to be one is that what you're interested
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
my concern is so I I would I was in a
 
02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
fraternity right you can you can smoke
 
02:01:58.970 --> 02:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
marijuana out of damn near anything
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.370 --> 02:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
I I just don't want people to start
 
02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
getting in trouble or getting their
 
02:02:10.129 --> 02:02:10.139 align:start position:0%
business shut down for selling things
 
02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
that they didn't know they wouldn't they
 
02:02:13.729 --> 02:02:13.739 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be getting shut down okay all
 
02:02:13.739 --> 02:02:14.570 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be getting shut down okay all
right

02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:02:16.010 --> 02:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
right they're not you're not going to
 
02:02:17.330 --> 02:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
shut down somebody who's got walking
 
02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
around with an apple with a whole drill
 
02:02:22.609 --> 02:02:22.619 align:start position:0%
into it correct okay
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
I think I'm on the subcommittee yes you
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
are yeah okay
 
02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:26.990 align:start position:0%
are yeah okay
um

02:02:26.990 --> 02:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
this may be resolved but factoring in
 
02:02:33.490 --> 02:02:33.500 align:start position:0%
the local that local municipalities can
 
02:02:37.729 --> 02:02:37.739 align:start position:0%
bar cannabis licenses in their locality
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
if you need a license to sell glassware
 
02:02:43.370 --> 02:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
the the local municipality could Trump
 
02:02:46.669 --> 02:02:46.679 align:start position:0%
your ability to sell the glassware if
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
02:02:50.209 --> 02:02:50.219 align:start position:0%
licensing under the cap another reason
 
02:02:52.970 --> 02:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
to remove it is what I'm saying
 
02:02:54.490 --> 02:02:54.500 align:start position:0%
good cut
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:02.089 --> 02:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
I think that the way this is written
 
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
that would be the case that the any type
 
02:03:05.810 --> 02:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
of cannabis license the municipality
 
02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:06.890 align:start position:0%
of cannabis license the municipality
could

02:03:06.890 --> 02:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:15.530 --> 02:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
so Zone it's a zoning issue then okay so
 
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
where where is it in the statute
 
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I think you'll have to take it out of
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
a couple places okay
 
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
your cannabis accessory retailer
 
02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
and then it's defined which is defined
 
02:03:38.169 --> 02:03:38.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.609 --> 02:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
the amendment to the retail tobacco well
 
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
do we do we really need to do that
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
because you still have the tobacco
 
02:03:49.729 --> 02:03:49.739 align:start position:0%
license so they could be selling their
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
glassware if they're not selling your
 
02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
scenario is no marijuana sales are
 
02:03:58.010 --> 02:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
permitted in Happy Town
 
02:04:00.649 --> 02:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
but they they're either there or want to
 
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
be there there's no provision to deny
 
02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
them a tobacco license
 
02:04:06.050 --> 02:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
so they could be there selling their
 
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
glassware to go with the tobacco license
 
02:04:11.089 --> 02:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
which is essentially what's happening
 
02:04:14.689 --> 02:04:14.699 align:start position:0%
now so that's the the intent of putting
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
it in those licenses was the original
 
02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
the original amendment required rules
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
on cannabis accessories and
 
02:04:29.390 --> 02:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia there are no there are no
 
02:04:31.729 --> 02:04:31.739 align:start position:0%
regulations on any of that right now so
 
02:04:34.669 --> 02:04:34.679 align:start position:0%
if you create rules on them then you
 
02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
there has to be the ability to regulate
 
02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
those rules and the only way for us to
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
regulate the rules is to put them in a
 
02:04:43.129 --> 02:04:43.139 align:start position:0%
license so if there's going to be no
 
02:04:45.169 --> 02:04:45.179 align:start position:0%
regulation on cannabis accessories or
 
02:04:47.209 --> 02:04:47.219 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia then there's no need for
 
02:04:49.850 --> 02:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
the license types if we want regulation
 
02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
on the Cannabis accessories
 
02:04:53.570 --> 02:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia this was the best
 
02:04:55.729 --> 02:04:55.739 align:start position:0%
structure to do that don't we have the
 
02:04:58.070 --> 02:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
concern of we need to produce a bill
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to be passable
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
and both houses and signable so I would
 
02:05:06.050 --> 02:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
rather leave these as well I may find
 
02:05:09.169 --> 02:05:09.179 align:start position:0%
extra licensing morally reprehensible it
 
02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
may be a practical reality to to
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
creating a bill that's everybody can
 
02:05:17.149 --> 02:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
very majority of people can live with
 
02:05:19.370 --> 02:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
just my thought
 
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
Joe are you saying you think we should
 
02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
leave it in or
 
02:05:23.159 --> 02:05:24.709 align:start position:0%
leave it in or
okay

02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:26.689 --> 02:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
yes representative Vinson thank you Mr
 
02:05:28.850 --> 02:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
chairman a point of clarification uh I'm
 
02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
going to use an example so I own a
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
fireworks store in the state of New
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire file uh Class C fireworks
 
02:05:37.070 --> 02:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
illegal in the state of New Hampshire in
 
02:05:40.189 --> 02:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
any City town uh in the state of New
 
02:05:42.169 --> 02:05:42.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the difference is is because
 
02:05:44.689 --> 02:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
the ordinance for a towns may be
 
02:05:46.430 --> 02:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
different you may not be able to light
 
02:05:50.330 --> 02:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
them off in say Dover for example so my
 
02:05:51.890 --> 02:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
question is this
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
pot if pass is going to be legal in the
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so they'll be
 
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
able to possess it
 
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
even in the towns that don't accept it
 
02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
you just can't smoke it there correct is
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
that what is that what we're talking
 
02:06:08.330 --> 02:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:09.649 --> 02:06:09.659 align:start position:0%
is that what we're talking about here
 
02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
that's what I want to know yeah that's
 
02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about no we're
 
02:06:14.450 --> 02:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
talking about the paraphernalia no I
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
know I get that but I and I thought we
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
got past that my question is
 
02:06:22.070 --> 02:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
pot was legalized in the state of New
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you can have it in any City in
 
02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
town you just can't smoke it in certain
 
02:06:29.570 --> 02:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
ordinances in the city of town correct
 
02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
well right now you can't sell it either
 
02:06:33.890 --> 02:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
well I get that but if the bill was
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
passed it once the bill has passed
 
02:06:40.250 --> 02:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
there's no no uh the legislation in
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
terms of dealing with the marijuana
 
02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
possession is Statewide Statewide so but
 
02:06:48.770 --> 02:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
I think the extra The Twist is is that I
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
think there are some towns that pass
 
02:06:53.330 --> 02:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
zoning that ban marijuana paraphernalia
 
02:06:57.229 --> 02:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
okay so that that yes they would they
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
just they're banned Now by putting this
 
02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
in this bill there's an opportunity
 
02:07:04.370 --> 02:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
where the town might say okay we don't
 
02:07:07.609 --> 02:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
have to ban it because they have to just
 
02:07:11.149 --> 02:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
get this license correct thank you for
 
02:07:13.850 --> 02:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
that point okay so that might be
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
a good thing
 
02:07:18.050 --> 02:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
to stop those towns from
 
02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
passing those ordinances
 
02:07:29.089 --> 02:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:31.370 --> 02:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
no I'm not generally surprised I know
 
02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
your position on this bill and I'm glad
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
to have you here I was just confused
 
02:07:36.830 --> 02:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
still about the glassware thing and I'm
 
02:07:39.530 --> 02:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
just playing catch up and um coming from
 
02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
a different committee but uh
 
02:07:43.129 --> 02:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
so are you telling me
 
02:07:45.770 --> 02:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
as a committee that the corner store by
 
02:07:47.930 --> 02:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
my house that has glassware that I'm
 
02:07:50.270 --> 02:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
confident is not for tobacco use but is
 
02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
labeled as such right
 
02:07:54.830 --> 02:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
um that they are currently required to
 
02:07:57.649 --> 02:07:57.659 align:start position:0%
have a tobacco license no if they don't
 
02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
sell tobacco they do okay they sell
 
02:08:02.270 --> 02:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
cigarettes they sell cigarettes so that
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
means they have the cigarette but they
 
02:08:07.250 --> 02:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
have a tobacco license and and one of
 
02:08:09.169 --> 02:08:09.179 align:start position:0%
the things about this bill was that we
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
have decided because the enforcement of
 
02:08:14.089 --> 02:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
that is actually the Liquor Commission
 
02:08:16.250 --> 02:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
so and we didn't change the title of the
 
02:08:17.810 --> 02:08:17.820 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission to liquor tobacco when
 
02:08:19.370 --> 02:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
we did that it's still just Liquor
 
02:08:21.530 --> 02:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
Commission so that's why we're now
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
molding the marijuana regulation
 
02:08:27.890 --> 02:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
enforcement to the same Department the
 
02:08:29.450 --> 02:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
same Commission
 
02:08:32.089 --> 02:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
so in this case the issue was what
 
02:08:33.890 --> 02:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
happens uh it we actually had the
 
02:08:35.330 --> 02:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
problem with some of the vaping places
 
02:08:38.209 --> 02:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
that all they sold was vaping
 
02:08:41.209 --> 02:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
okay and so therefore you know that that
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of getting the tobacco
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
license you know that that we require
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
them to have that tobacco because
 
02:08:49.609 --> 02:08:49.619 align:start position:0%
because a lot of most establishments
 
02:08:51.169 --> 02:08:51.179 align:start position:0%
have the have a dual license they have
 
02:08:53.689 --> 02:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
beer you know liquor beer and wine and
 
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
they have tobacco so that most but it's
 
02:08:58.609 --> 02:08:58.619 align:start position:0%
some some are limited so
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
um we're we're certainly conscious of
 
02:09:03.410 --> 02:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
that some businesses are very lean and
 
02:09:06.290 --> 02:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
mean and are very focused so I guess the
 
02:09:09.290 --> 02:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
issue is if somebody was selling just
 
02:09:12.589 --> 02:09:12.599 align:start position:0%
glass devices and then someone walked in
 
02:09:14.209 --> 02:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
and said boy that sure looks like a
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
marijuana pipe to me
 
02:09:19.609 --> 02:09:19.619 align:start position:0%
um that that this person could get cover
 
02:09:21.950 --> 02:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
by just getting this license that's
 
02:09:24.050 --> 02:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
going to be what 50 bucks you know the
 
02:09:26.570 --> 02:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
minimal license but that that it will
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
then allow them to sell it and that the
 
02:09:31.550 --> 02:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
commission knows who they are and and
 
02:09:33.530 --> 02:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
hopefully they will not sell that pipe
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
to someone under 21.
 
02:09:36.599 --> 02:09:38.990 align:start position:0%
to someone under 21.
sure

02:09:38.990 --> 02:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:09:41.089 --> 02:09:41.099 align:start position:0%
the intent in the legislation or of this
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee to allow municipalities to
 
02:09:45.649 --> 02:09:45.659 align:start position:0%
limit the consumption of cannabis just
 
02:09:46.930 --> 02:09:46.940 align:start position:0%
the sale
 
02:09:49.250 --> 02:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
no that actually is yeah exactly in
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
terms of his question we are we're not
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
regulating the usage all we're
 
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
regulating is that the town has the
 
02:09:58.010 --> 02:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
right to choose whether they'll have a
 
02:10:00.109 --> 02:10:00.119 align:start position:0%
marijuana retail establishment in their
 
02:10:00.119 --> 02:10:01.010 align:start position:0%
marijuana retail establishment in their
town

02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:10:03.950 --> 02:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and chairman okay uh representative
 
02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
M and then I'll come to you Chris
 
02:10:08.450 --> 02:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
just thinking this through about the
 
02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:10.070 align:start position:0%
just thinking this through about the
glassware

02:10:10.070 --> 02:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
glassware
 
02:10:13.370 --> 02:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
here's a scenario okay let's say I'm a
 
02:10:16.010 --> 02:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
glass blower and I'm a I I blow our
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
Artesian glass okay uh and uh you know
 
02:10:23.810 --> 02:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
would I need to get a license
 
02:10:28.490 --> 02:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh to continue selling my custom
 
02:10:30.770 --> 02:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
devices I would say only if you were
 
02:10:33.169 --> 02:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
marketing it for someone do you sell to
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
use it for marijuana if you were
 
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
changing your marketing strategy you
 
02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
know Market but a Venetian glass it's a
 
02:10:41.149 --> 02:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
you're you're selling a very expensive
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
piece of glass uh glass you know it's
 
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
usually a Vaz it's usually glass
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
drinking wear or something like that
 
02:10:50.570 --> 02:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
um I don't think you're if you're but if
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
you were to make a glass pipe which I
 
02:10:54.550 --> 02:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
think I've seen that in my local
 
02:10:57.290 --> 02:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
convenience store the marijuana pie if
 
02:10:58.729 --> 02:10:58.739 align:start position:0%

02:11:02.330 --> 02:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
we're asking him to get a license
 
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:07.010 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

02:11:07.010 --> 02:11:07.020 align:start position:0%

to our former member of the Commerce
 
02:11:09.119 --> 02:11:10.209 align:start position:0%
to our former member of the Commerce
Committee

02:11:10.209 --> 02:11:10.219 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
oh yeah right excuse me representative
 
02:11:14.750 --> 02:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
McAlister didn't have a question
 
02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
um it's thank you not so much the
 
02:11:18.530 --> 02:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
question but just a clarification if I
 
02:11:21.410 --> 02:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
understand it uh a town like Dover can
 
02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
say you can't you can't uh sell
 
02:11:27.290 --> 02:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
marijuana in the town but they can't
 
02:11:30.290 --> 02:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
keep somebody from buying marijuana and
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
coming into Dover but they also I think
 
02:11:34.850 --> 02:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
the state of the law says you can't
 
02:11:37.609 --> 02:11:37.619 align:start position:0%
smoke in public regardless yes that's so
 
02:11:40.970 --> 02:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
and and it's sort of like fireworks uh
 
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
my town doesn't allow you to do
 
02:11:45.770 --> 02:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
fireworks but you can own them you just
 
02:11:47.629 --> 02:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
gotta you just gotta set them off in
 
02:11:47.639 --> 02:11:49.370 align:start position:0%
gotta you just gotta set them off in
Bartlett

02:11:49.370 --> 02:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
Bartlett
 
02:11:49.380 --> 02:11:53.030 align:start position:0%
Bartlett
okay

02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:55.310 --> 02:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
all right so actually I think this was
 
02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
not a business committee I think I had
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
this in the liquor committee this is
 
02:12:04.330 --> 02:12:04.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.430 --> 02:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
you have a brief comment on the bill as
 
02:12:13.990 --> 02:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
written absolutely Joe Hannon uh
 
02:12:16.490 --> 02:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
cannabis accessories I just wanted to
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
comment that it could be any equipment
 
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
products or materials of any kind that
 
02:12:22.850 --> 02:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
are used intended to use or designed for
 
02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
use in planting propagating cultivating
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
does this mean that Lowe's and Home
 
02:12:28.669 --> 02:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
Depot and any garden supply store is
 
02:12:29.810 --> 02:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
gonna have to be licensed to sell
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
potting soil uh heat lamps uh irrigation
 
02:12:36.129 --> 02:12:36.139 align:start position:0%
this legislation does not
 
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
permit home usage this is only retail so
 
02:12:44.810 --> 02:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
so therefore the licensee if you are a
 
02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:45.950 align:start position:0%
so therefore the licensee if you are a
cultivator

02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
cultivator
 
02:12:47.689 --> 02:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
which is sounds like where you were
 
02:12:51.490 --> 02:12:51.500 align:start position:0%
going with your comments okay cultivator
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
that if you wanted yes you have to have
 
02:12:57.770 --> 02:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
a license to be a cultivator
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
right I mean I'm not talking about being
 
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
cultivator but if someone's selling
 
02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
those products to cultivators or
 
02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
non-cultivators they're the same
 
02:13:06.410 --> 02:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
products so it's a person that's selling
 
02:13:07.550 --> 02:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
it have to how do you differentiate
 
02:13:09.410 --> 02:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
someone selling those things to a
 
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
non-cultivator because the at the end of
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
the day you're you're not you're not
 
02:13:15.890 --> 02:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
doing anything to to for marijuana
 
02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
you're selling a generic product that
 
02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
can be be used for anything it's the
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
cultivator is the one that needs to has
 
02:13:25.490 --> 02:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
the license if he's purchasing it
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
for purchasing not sales even though the
 
02:13:29.629 --> 02:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
sales people selling the growing size
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
you've got to be selling something
 
02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's clearly going to be used for
 
02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:35.330 align:start position:0%
that's clearly going to be used for
marijuana

02:13:35.330 --> 02:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
02:13:37.669 --> 02:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay and let's face it it's not like the
 
02:13:39.229 --> 02:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
commission is going to be go into every
 
02:13:40.490 --> 02:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
business and see what they're doing I
 
02:13:43.490 --> 02:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
hope not you know it's just it's up all
 
02:13:45.890 --> 02:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative Osborne
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
all right one more one more time front
 
02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.330 align:start position:0%
all right one more one more time front
page

02:13:50.330 --> 02:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
at the bottom where it says cannabis
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
accessories yes it says any equipment
 
02:13:57.649 --> 02:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
products or materials of any kind that
 
02:14:00.410 --> 02:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
are used intended for use or designed
 
02:14:02.990 --> 02:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
for use so it's not just design for use
 
02:14:06.290 --> 02:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
but are used so if I take this pen cap
 
02:14:09.229 --> 02:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
and go smoke marijuana out of it
 
02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
are you as the pen seller now going to
 
02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
need a license to sell this pen because
 
02:14:16.729 --> 02:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
I happen to use it one time
 
02:14:19.490 --> 02:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
for that purpose can we strike this one
 
02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:20.270 align:start position:0%
for that purpose can we strike this one
word

02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
word
 
02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.550 --> 02:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
02:14:28.250 --> 02:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
I used
 
02:14:31.069 --> 02:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
I think the intended for use
 
02:14:32.689 --> 02:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
so you just want to take that are
 
02:14:34.910 --> 02:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
intended for the use yeah intended for
 
02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
intended or designed for use okay so
 
02:14:40.189 --> 02:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
just to just delete the word
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
used used that are like you've got to
 
02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
make the sentence correct any kind that
 
02:14:51.050 --> 02:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
are intended for use
 
02:14:53.209 --> 02:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
our chairman who who drafted this
 
02:14:55.609 --> 02:14:55.619 align:start position:0%
originally so that the word was used so
 
02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:57.599 align:start position:0%
just what was that put in there
 
02:14:58.970 --> 02:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
what was the thing did you guys really
 
02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
mean to do that we did that Mark who's
 
02:15:03.649 --> 02:15:03.659 align:start position:0%
with that who put that in there
 
02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:09.169 --> 02:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
that's from UK oh that's right you're
 
02:15:10.370 --> 02:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
the one who thought you would really
 
02:15:13.729 --> 02:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
solve this thing okay see
 
02:15:15.649 --> 02:15:15.659 align:start position:0%
and you know what she would have been on
 
02:15:17.330 --> 02:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
your commission
 
02:15:19.420 --> 02:15:19.430 align:start position:0%
she would have been on your commission
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:22.069 align:start position:0%
she would have been on your commission
[Laughter]

02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:15:24.109 --> 02:15:24.119 align:start position:0%
so in short Mr chairman we're hearing
 
02:15:26.209 --> 02:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
that this was a mistake yes yeah right
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
she didn't she didn't intend that's the
 
02:15:32.209 --> 02:15:32.219 align:start position:0%
word okay the word should not be there
 
02:15:32.219 --> 02:15:34.010 align:start position:0%
word okay the word should not be there
okay

02:15:34.010 --> 02:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:15:36.890 --> 02:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
all right so we we will call that a uh
 
02:15:40.490 --> 02:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
unintended uh error uh a minor a minor
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment but that does mean we'll have
 
02:15:44.750 --> 02:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
to reprint all of these things for
 
02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:45.790 align:start position:0%
to reprint all of these things for
everybody

02:15:45.790 --> 02:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:15:49.490 --> 02:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
but that's okay all right so
 
02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:50.410 align:start position:0%
but that's okay all right so
um

02:15:50.410 --> 02:15:50.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:56.330 --> 02:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:00.770 --> 02:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.370 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:16:07.370 --> 02:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:14.569 --> 02:16:14.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:24.169 --> 02:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
it will have a new number yeah the bill
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
will have a new number okay
 
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
yeah well that unfortunately that
 
02:16:33.049 --> 02:16:33.059 align:start position:0%
changes randomly changes often so we're
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
careful about doing that so normally I
 
02:16:36.349 --> 02:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
would just say Roman numeral three the
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
under the definition of cannabis so
 
02:16:41.389 --> 02:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis accessories excuse me okay is
 
02:16:43.549 --> 02:16:43.559 align:start position:0%
the question clear so now we're looking
 
02:16:50.929 --> 02:16:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%

02:17:35.219 --> 02:17:36.650 align:start position:0%

02:17:36.650 --> 02:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:17:40.370 --> 02:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
next to one all right we're

the one it's what I have in here
okay

02:18:05.930 --> 02:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:05.940 --> 02:18:10.270 align:start position:0%

02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
pull out the screen
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay or are you taking aluminum foil
 
02:18:15.840 --> 03:29:01.429 align:start position:0%
okay or are you taking aluminum foil
yeah

03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%

foreign
 
03:29:03.540 --> 03:29:06.110 align:start position:0%
foreign
and

03:29:06.110 --> 03:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:09.469 --> 03:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
that anybody like a discussion on why
 
03:29:11.269 --> 03:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
we're retaining it
 
03:29:13.490 --> 03:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
I think we'd be
 
03:29:13.500 --> 03:29:17.469 align:start position:0%
I think we'd be
good

03:29:17.469 --> 03:29:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:20.389 --> 03:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
so I I would say I did see uh
 
03:29:22.670 --> 03:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney uh downstairs for
 
03:29:25.190 --> 03:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
lunch and explained to her uh what
 
03:29:28.190 --> 03:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
happened and uh and I told her watch the
 
03:29:30.530 --> 03:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
tape watch the Youtube
 
03:29:33.050 --> 03:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
um but uh but we're we're confident that
 
03:29:36.050 --> 03:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission will resolve it
 
03:29:39.229 --> 03:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
um uh in a way that that uh he when my
 
03:29:40.670 --> 03:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up just let you all know the
 
03:29:42.290 --> 03:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
follow-up conversation I had with them
 
03:29:45.229 --> 03:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
about rules is that
 
03:29:45.239 --> 03:29:46.790 align:start position:0%
about rules is that
that

03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:46.800 --> 03:29:47.990 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:29:47.990 --> 03:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:49.790 --> 03:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
the statute talks about the five
 
03:29:49.800 --> 03:29:51.290 align:start position:0%
the statute talks about the five
thousand

03:29:51.290 --> 03:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
03:29:55.969 --> 03:29:55.979 align:start position:0%
uh the the top ends but the idea of
 
03:29:59.510 --> 03:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
adding in this uh 30-day uh mandatory
 
03:30:01.610 --> 03:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
for employees who don't are not trained
 
03:30:04.010 --> 03:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
she said that would not necessarily
 
03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
require a statutory change that they
 
03:30:09.110 --> 03:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
could do that by rule but as I would at
 
03:30:10.429 --> 03:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
some point in time I would say we
 
03:30:11.929 --> 03:30:11.939 align:start position:0%
probably still would want to put it in
 
03:30:13.610 --> 03:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
the Statue we would whatever they do
 
03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
with the rules with the penalties I
 
03:30:17.990 --> 03:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
think should should ultimately be in in
 
03:30:20.150 --> 03:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
the statute just so so it's easier for
 
03:30:22.630 --> 03:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
people to follow because I I've actually
 
03:30:25.370 --> 03:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
been people complain about how much
 
03:30:27.590 --> 03:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
rules are going on how rule making I
 
03:30:30.650 --> 03:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
always said that um and obviously now
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to date myself but way back
 
03:30:33.889 --> 03:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
when it didn't happen when I was here I
 
03:30:35.150 --> 03:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
was probably having my freshman year
 
03:30:38.650 --> 03:30:38.660 align:start position:0%
that every Department actually expired
 
03:30:42.610 --> 03:30:42.620 align:start position:0%
and that it uh they had to be re-upped
 
03:30:44.990 --> 03:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
for every Department would ever say
 
03:30:47.630 --> 03:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
agency and uh and I always said well we
 
03:30:49.429 --> 03:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
should do that with rules that that at
 
03:30:51.950 --> 03:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
times when we pass legislation and we
 
03:30:53.990 --> 03:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
said okay we will give rulemaking for
 
03:30:55.670 --> 03:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
this rulemaking for that I always
 
03:30:57.469 --> 03:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
thought that those rules should then
 
03:30:59.090 --> 03:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
come after they're all done and
 
03:31:00.469 --> 03:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
implemented then they should come back
 
03:31:03.530 --> 03:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
to us and put in a statute so
 
03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs you want to make a
 
03:31:07.490 --> 03:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
comment on that thank you Mr chairman
 
03:31:07.500 --> 03:31:09.309 align:start position:0%
comment on that thank you Mr chairman
German

03:31:09.309 --> 03:31:09.319 align:start position:0%
German
 
03:31:13.429 --> 03:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
I was a director of a state agency
 
03:31:15.650 --> 03:31:15.660 align:start position:0%
during that period it was called the
 
03:31:18.889 --> 03:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
sunset the sunset and my agency the New
 
03:31:21.229 --> 03:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Human Rights Commission was in
 
03:31:23.510 --> 03:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
the first Sunset round and we had the
 
03:31:25.969 --> 03:31:25.979 align:start position:0%
Good Fortune to be in The Last Sunset
 
03:31:25.979 --> 03:31:26.950 align:start position:0%
Good Fortune to be in The Last Sunset
right

03:31:26.950 --> 03:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:31:31.190 --> 03:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
that law was repealed because it was
 
03:31:35.690 --> 03:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
found to be completely wasteful it did
 
03:31:38.690 --> 03:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
nothing useful and from my experience
 
03:31:40.969 --> 03:31:40.979 align:start position:0%
having had the enjoyable experience of
 
03:31:43.849 --> 03:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
two rounds I can tell you for sure it
 
03:31:46.210 --> 03:31:46.220 align:start position:0%
was completely wasteful
 
03:31:48.650 --> 03:31:48.660 align:start position:0%
but I was getting to the but the idea
 
03:31:52.190 --> 03:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
that rules should come back and and be
 
03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
installed and such because we're not
 
03:31:56.030 --> 03:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
into the minutia especially you take the
 
03:31:57.830 --> 03:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
what we've done with 639 how much
 
03:32:00.050 --> 03:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
rulemaking is going on with that that at
 
03:32:01.250 --> 03:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
some point in time you think wouldn't it
 
03:32:03.110 --> 03:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
be better that after the rules were
 
03:32:04.849 --> 03:32:04.859 align:start position:0%
implemented that had then come back to
 
03:32:07.969 --> 03:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
us and then be put in the statute so so
 
03:32:09.530 --> 03:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
it's kind of one stop shopping when
 
03:32:10.550 --> 03:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
you're looking to know what the law is
 
03:32:12.229 --> 03:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if we're gonna if we're
 
03:32:14.150 --> 03:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
taking us in the way back machine to
 
03:32:15.830 --> 03:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
that time when you made that suggestion
 
03:32:18.530 --> 03:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'm curious to know how is that received
 
03:32:20.990 --> 03:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh did you get an offer of extra credits
 
03:32:25.370 --> 03:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:27.349 --> 03:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
um well there's a lot of wonderful ideas
 
03:32:29.809 --> 03:32:29.819 align:start position:0%
I have but that didn't go very far like
 
03:32:32.450 --> 03:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
that if we were to have a if we were
 
03:32:33.830 --> 03:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
going to do casinos we should have a
 
03:32:36.349 --> 03:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
state casino and I wanted to put it in
 
03:32:38.570 --> 03:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
Salem Windham right in between the
 
03:32:40.910 --> 03:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
highways whereas they've now taken that
 
03:32:42.229 --> 03:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
away because they expanded the highway
 
03:32:43.849 --> 03:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
through that area but I thought we
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
should have a state casino that the only
 
03:32:46.550 --> 03:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
way you could get in or out of it is
 
03:32:49.250 --> 03:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
from the highway but that's another idea
 
03:32:50.690 --> 03:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
actually I did have some lobbyists
 
03:32:51.950 --> 03:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
thought that you know that was a good
 
03:32:54.710 --> 03:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
idea but it didn't get president okay so
 
03:32:56.929 --> 03:32:56.939 align:start position:0%
the motion is to retain any more
 
03:32:58.670 --> 03:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion see none the
 
03:33:00.410 --> 03:33:00.420 align:start position:0%

consent calendar under what I was
 
03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
thinking okay
 
03:37:29.389 --> 03:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
not only the old days when I used to be
 
03:37:33.170 --> 03:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
just the chair could say I have a sense
 
03:37:33.180 --> 03:37:35.929 align:start position:0%
just the chair could say I have a sense
but

03:37:35.929 --> 03:37:35.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:38.570 --> 03:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
no there is no blur with fruit retaining
 
03:37:40.670 --> 03:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's no butter
 
03:37:43.370 --> 03:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
okay uh last but not least uh House Bill
 
03:37:43.380 --> 03:37:45.170 align:start position:0%
okay uh last but not least uh House Bill
639

03:37:45.170 --> 03:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
639
 
03:37:47.750 --> 03:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so it is actually uh the legislative
 
03:37:50.590 --> 03:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
Services is working on it
 
03:37:53.570 --> 03:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
normally we don't vote on anything
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
without having it in front of us so we
 
03:37:59.870 --> 03:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
could do one of two things we could uh
 
03:38:02.570 --> 03:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
waive that rule and I could certainly
 
03:38:04.370 --> 03:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
review all the changes that we're making
 
03:38:07.190 --> 03:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
wait till after we've had our hearings
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
and take it up later today
 
03:38:12.469 --> 03:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
Representative Vincent make a motion to
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:17.929 --> 03:38:17.939 align:start position:0%
all right all those in favor and waving
 
03:38:19.670 --> 03:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
the rules say yes
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh those opposed
 
03:38:24.410 --> 03:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:38:27.110 --> 03:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
um since I gave my version away I'm
 
03:38:29.690 --> 03:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna do this by memory on the
 
03:38:31.309 --> 03:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
first page
 
03:38:34.250 --> 03:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
down where is the Cannabis uh
 
03:38:34.260 --> 03:38:35.630 align:start position:0%
down where is the Cannabis uh
paraphernalia

03:38:35.630 --> 03:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia
 
03:38:35.640 --> 03:38:37.370 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia
definition

03:38:37.370 --> 03:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
definition
 
03:38:39.170 --> 03:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
excuse me yeah accessories in
 
03:38:41.330 --> 03:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia we're going to remove on
 
03:38:47.389 --> 03:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:55.570 --> 03:38:55.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:58.309 --> 03:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
page eight
 
03:39:03.170 --> 03:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
it was line 19.
 
03:39:03.180 --> 03:39:04.250 align:start position:0%
it was line 19.
um

03:39:04.250 --> 03:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:06.830 --> 03:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
I don't even know if kanana bin is a
 
03:39:10.010 --> 03:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
word or not but is going to be cannabis
 
03:39:14.450 --> 03:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:18.410 --> 03:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
so on line 19 on page 8 it says the
 
03:39:21.610 --> 03:39:21.620 align:start position:0%
testing shall also verify THC and other
 
03:39:24.590 --> 03:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
canaanabin potency representations for
 
03:39:27.349 --> 03:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
correct labeling cannabin well the N
 
03:39:29.090 --> 03:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
will be dropped and will be replaced
 
03:39:30.710 --> 03:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
with an s
 
03:39:30.720 --> 03:39:34.809 align:start position:0%
with an s
cannabis

03:39:34.809 --> 03:39:34.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:45.710 --> 03:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:50.090 --> 03:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:53.450 --> 03:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
um online well it's it's F10 licensure
 
03:39:56.690 --> 03:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
procedures for cannabis establishment
 
03:39:59.870 --> 03:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh no no it's not it excuse me
 
03:40:05.929 --> 03:40:05.939 align:start position:0%
uh 12. if 318 F9 Roman numeral two
 
03:40:08.269 --> 03:40:08.279 align:start position:0%
says the proposal shall include a plan
 
03:40:10.490 --> 03:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
to allow the Cannabis retail stores to
 
03:40:12.290 --> 03:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
obtain a therapeutic cannabis
 
03:40:14.389 --> 03:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
endorsement that will allow them to
 
03:40:15.769 --> 03:40:15.779 align:start position:0%
serve qualified patients without
 
03:40:15.779 --> 03:40:17.269 align:start position:0%
serve qualified patients without
imposing

03:40:17.269 --> 03:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
imposing
 
03:40:20.990 --> 03:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
the meals cannabis and rooms tax
 
03:40:25.490 --> 03:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
well that since we now have removed
 
03:40:29.090 --> 03:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
the rooms and meals tax let alone we're
 
03:40:30.410 --> 03:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
really going to change the rooms of
 
03:40:32.809 --> 03:40:32.819 align:start position:0%
military camps oh my God thank God we
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
removed this line okay so what that is
 
03:40:38.510 --> 03:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
going to replace is uh
 
03:40:41.090 --> 03:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh no I don't remember but it's going to
 
03:40:44.510 --> 03:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
basically refer to the RSA that has the
 
03:40:49.309 --> 03:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
excise tax which is only paid by the
 
03:40:49.319 --> 03:40:50.269 align:start position:0%
excise tax which is only paid by the
um

03:40:50.269 --> 03:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:52.910 --> 03:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman which line is this so this
 
03:40:54.469 --> 03:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
is line
 
03:40:54.479 --> 03:40:56.210 align:start position:0%
is line
14.

03:40:56.210 --> 03:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
14.
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
it starts on 13 where it says imposing
 
03:40:58.800 --> 03:40:59.750 align:start position:0%
it starts on 13 where it says imposing
okay

03:40:59.750 --> 03:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:40:59.760 --> 03:41:01.910 align:start position:0%
okay
so

03:41:01.910 --> 03:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
the bills cannabis and room sacks so
 
03:41:07.929 --> 03:41:07.939 align:start position:0%
So Adam what was the what is the rep
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
page was the reference to then it was to
 
03:41:10.560 --> 03:41:11.630 align:start position:0%
page was the reference to then it was to
uh

03:41:11.630 --> 03:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:41:13.849 --> 03:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
where's the actual tax that we remember
 
03:41:16.370 --> 03:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
I had it I had my finger on it the last
 
03:41:21.950 --> 03:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:25.429 --> 03:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
so anyways we we only have one tax
 
03:41:28.010 --> 03:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
and the tax is going to be done at the
 
03:41:29.990 --> 03:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
cultivator level
 
03:41:34.610 --> 03:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
and so that will refer to that RSA
 
03:41:37.130 --> 03:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
in here somewhere
 
03:41:38.929 --> 03:41:38.939 align:start position:0%
okay so we get surprised we can find it
 
03:41:38.939 --> 03:41:42.710 align:start position:0%
okay so we get surprised we can find it
first

03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:44.929 --> 03:41:44.939 align:start position:0%
okay so those are the only three changes
 
03:41:47.269 --> 03:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
that legislative Services is working on
 
03:41:49.309 --> 03:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
and doing it
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
um I would say that this bill has a long
 
03:41:52.790 --> 03:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
way to go
 
03:41:54.650 --> 03:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
there'll be plenty of chances for
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
eyeballs to eye things and and
 
03:41:57.840 --> 03:41:59.090 align:start position:0%
eyeballs to eye things and and
um

03:41:59.090 --> 03:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:01.010 --> 03:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
who knows what it's going to look like
 
03:42:03.050 --> 03:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
on the back end but
 
03:42:05.990 --> 03:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
so is there any other discussion on the
 
03:42:08.150 --> 03:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
changes yep are they working on this
 
03:42:09.710 --> 03:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
right now will they have it done by the
 
03:42:12.050 --> 03:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
time we're done I I would assume that it
 
03:42:13.490 --> 03:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
would be done by the end of the day yes
 
03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
we would have it at the end of the day
 
03:42:16.610 --> 03:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
but we've waived the rule that we'll
 
03:42:19.630 --> 03:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
vote go ahead and vote for it now okay
 
03:42:22.790 --> 03:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
we have an amendment number no we don't
 
03:42:25.490 --> 03:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
so that that amendment number will be
 
03:42:30.590 --> 03:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:32.269 --> 03:42:32.279 align:start position:0%
any more discussion on the motion yes
 
03:42:34.849 --> 03:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
representative procedural questions you
 
03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
just mentioned there will be
 
03:42:38.090 --> 03:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
opportunities for changes can you as a
 
03:42:40.190 --> 03:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
first time rep can you please explain
 
03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
articulate all the opportunities okay so
 
03:42:45.729 --> 03:42:45.739 align:start position:0%
let's say between between now and
 
03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
Wednesday Thursday when this when we
 
03:42:51.229 --> 03:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
have uh the floor session
 
03:42:52.910 --> 03:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
if it comes out that something is
 
03:42:55.370 --> 03:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
obvious then we would do a floor
 
03:42:55.380 --> 03:42:56.570 align:start position:0%
obvious then we would do a floor
Amendment

03:42:56.570 --> 03:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:42:59.150 --> 03:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
and that and I would have representative
 
03:43:00.710 --> 03:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
Burroughs and I would make a floor
 
03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to that change once uh then it
 
03:43:06.290 --> 03:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
goes on to finance
 
03:43:08.929 --> 03:43:08.939 align:start position:0%
uh finance committee has an opportunity
 
03:43:11.090 --> 03:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
to do whatever they want with this bill
 
03:43:13.490 --> 03:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
and and obviously if there's some
 
03:43:15.050 --> 03:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
Amendment comes up that needs to be
 
03:43:17.809 --> 03:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
changed it could be done as an amendment
 
03:43:20.030 --> 03:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
in the finance committee and then they
 
03:43:21.889 --> 03:43:21.899 align:start position:0%
too would have the same procedure
 
03:43:24.530 --> 03:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
waiting for hit the house floor if they
 
03:43:26.450 --> 03:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
something is not correct it can be fixed
 
03:43:27.710 --> 03:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
in the housework
 
03:43:29.870 --> 03:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
so that would make it get it out of the
 
03:43:31.610 --> 03:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
house then then it's over to the Senate
 
03:43:33.830 --> 03:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
and who knows what the Senate May do
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:38.690 --> 03:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
steps yes
 
03:43:41.150 --> 03:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
can Finance change anything in it or
 
03:43:43.849 --> 03:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
just relative to the finance how many
 
03:43:45.530 --> 03:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
years have you been arrested not enough
 
03:43:48.950 --> 03:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay so that's always been a
 
03:43:52.190 --> 03:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
um a uh I'd say
 
03:43:55.670 --> 03:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
a the rub because the assumption is that
 
03:43:56.990 --> 03:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
when it goes to the second committee
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
they should narrow their discussion to
 
03:44:01.849 --> 03:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
just that subject matter in which they
 
03:44:03.889 --> 03:44:03.899 align:start position:0%
have authority so it was not a dumb
 
03:44:03.899 --> 03:44:04.750 align:start position:0%
have authority so it was not a dumb
question

03:44:04.750 --> 03:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:44:07.070 --> 03:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
but no I didn't say it was a dumb
 
03:44:09.410 --> 03:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
question I said it was a dumb question
 
03:44:11.870 --> 03:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
okay no no I was saying is how many
 
03:44:13.130 --> 03:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
years have been have you heard this
 
03:44:15.889 --> 03:44:15.899 align:start position:0%
debate before about did did Finance
 
03:44:18.889 --> 03:44:18.899 align:start position:0%
really focus or ways and me's do they
 
03:44:20.990 --> 03:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
really just focus or did they feel free
 
03:44:23.330 --> 03:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
because in past years this marijuana
 
03:44:24.769 --> 03:44:24.779 align:start position:0%
bill has always gone through Ways and
 
03:44:27.889 --> 03:44:27.899 align:start position:0%
Means and and Lord knows they were going
 
03:44:30.950 --> 03:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
on beyond their subject tests
 
03:44:32.090 --> 03:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
anyway so no it's not a dumb question
 
03:44:35.389 --> 03:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
it's just it's one of those
 
03:44:37.370 --> 03:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
those things that are hanging around for
 
03:44:42.190 --> 03:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:47.210 --> 03:44:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:50.570 --> 03:44:50.580 align:start position:0%

so I'll give you a little bit of a quick
background

04:11:02.650 --> 04:11:02.660 align:start position:0%
background
 
04:11:05.570 --> 04:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
I was a young paramedic
 
04:11:08.570 --> 04:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
uh working on patient safety and
 
04:11:10.370 --> 04:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
resuscitating patients when I first
 
04:11:11.809 --> 04:11:11.819 align:start position:0%
joined the Commerce Committee I think
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
back in about 1996
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
and I learned from this committee about
 
04:11:20.510 --> 04:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
making Health Care efficient and
 
04:11:20.520 --> 04:11:21.650 align:start position:0%
making Health Care efficient and
practical

04:11:21.650 --> 04:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
practical
 
04:11:23.809 --> 04:11:23.819 align:start position:0%
and managing health care costs and
 
04:11:25.670 --> 04:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
various aspects of insurance then I went
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
off back into business for 20 some years
 
04:11:30.650 --> 04:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
before rejoining the legislature this
 
04:11:30.660 --> 04:11:32.450 align:start position:0%
before rejoining the legislature this
term

04:11:32.450 --> 04:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
term
 
04:11:34.130 --> 04:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
so a little bit of background we all
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
think pbms are a very health helpful
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
part in managing health care costs and
 
04:11:40.250 --> 04:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy costs
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
and I think we should understand a
 
04:11:44.210 --> 04:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
little bit about how the industry's
 
04:11:46.969 --> 04:11:46.979 align:start position:0%
evolved in 2011 there were seven major
 
04:11:49.550 --> 04:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy benefits managers
 
04:11:52.490 --> 04:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
by 2015 just four years later there were
 
04:11:53.689 --> 04:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
just four
 
04:11:58.490 --> 04:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
and then by 2022 Express Scripts OptumRx
 
04:12:01.610 --> 04:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
and CVS Caremark held 80 percent
 
04:12:03.889 --> 04:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
of the market the pharmacy benefits
 
04:12:05.630 --> 04:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
management business
 
04:12:08.689 --> 04:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
Insurance payers like Aetna are owned by
 
04:12:13.010 --> 04:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
CBS CVS owns CVS Caremark
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
Cigna owns Express Scripts UnitedHealth
 
04:12:18.650 --> 04:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
owns OptumRx
 
04:12:19.790 --> 04:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's a little important to understand
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
some of those relationships and the
 
04:12:23.929 --> 04:12:23.939 align:start position:0%
potential for inherent conflicts when we
 
04:12:25.969 --> 04:12:25.979 align:start position:0%
Endeavor to put the patient first
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
and understand who is billing and who is
 
04:12:29.570 --> 04:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
paying who
 
04:12:31.189 --> 04:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
so I think it's just important that we
 
04:12:32.990 --> 04:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
kind of have that little bit of contact
 
04:12:33.000 --> 04:12:34.670 align:start position:0%
kind of have that little bit of contact
context

04:12:34.670 --> 04:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
context
 
04:12:37.070 --> 04:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
when we think about the patient
 
04:12:37.080 --> 04:12:39.769 align:start position:0%
when we think about the patient
affordability

04:12:39.769 --> 04:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
04:12:42.050 --> 04:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
and the safety of clinician-administered
 
04:12:44.330 --> 04:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
drugs I just want to put that a little
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
bit into context because we do like
 
04:12:48.110 --> 04:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
efficiency in health care in New
 
04:12:50.210 --> 04:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we like affordability
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
when we evaluate health plans and how to
 
04:12:57.229 --> 04:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
maximize our health care dollar across
 
04:12:59.210 --> 04:12:59.220 align:start position:0%
the Continuum of Health Care
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
so that's what I'm trying to do with a
 
04:13:03.170 --> 04:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
relatively simple Bill about patient
 
04:13:05.090 --> 04:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
safety and about optimizing and reducing
 
04:13:06.769 --> 04:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
the cost of certain types of medication
 
04:13:09.469 --> 04:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
delivery under Pharmacy benefits versus
 
04:13:11.870 --> 04:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
medical benefits and I hope you'll all
 
04:13:14.389 --> 04:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
help me do that here on a with this bill
 
04:13:16.070 --> 04:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
that we've worked on for a number of
 
04:13:18.889 --> 04:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
months before it got to this point
 
04:13:20.689 --> 04:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
so this bill aims to address a little
 
04:13:23.570 --> 04:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
known and sometimes not well understood
 
04:13:25.670 --> 04:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
practice of health plans and Pharmacy
 
04:13:28.610 --> 04:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
benefit plans known as white bagging and
 
04:13:30.050 --> 04:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
brown bagging
 
04:13:32.809 --> 04:13:32.819 align:start position:0%
seems like an odd odd term a number of
 
04:13:34.490 --> 04:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
states have taken a look at this some
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
have enacted legislation some have not
 
04:13:38.510 --> 04:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
and many are considering it right now in
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
this legislative term
 
04:13:41.990 --> 04:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
while initially and sometimes
 
04:13:44.150 --> 04:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
well-intended and useful these practices
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
can often and occasionally be harmful
 
04:13:47.450 --> 04:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
and dangerous
 
04:13:49.130 --> 04:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
to certain patients especially cancer
 
04:13:50.689 --> 04:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
patients I'm sure everybody here has
 
04:13:52.070 --> 04:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
been touched by a cancer patient
 
04:13:55.849 --> 04:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
hopefully none of you will be personally
 
04:13:58.670 --> 04:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
these patients are high volume users of
 
04:14:00.769 --> 04:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
infusion treatments like chemotherapy
 
04:14:01.729 --> 04:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you've all heard of
 
04:14:04.689 --> 04:14:04.699 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy these drugs are
 
04:14:08.090 --> 04:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
administered generally by IV infusions
 
04:14:11.689 --> 04:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:13.729 --> 04:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
this is where white bagging comes into
 
04:14:13.739 --> 04:14:14.750 align:start position:0%
this is where white bagging comes into
play

04:14:14.750 --> 04:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
play
 
04:14:16.010 --> 04:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
so I know you know what a brown bag
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
lunch is probably packed one of taken it
 
04:14:19.729 --> 04:14:19.739 align:start position:0%
to school
 
04:14:23.090 --> 04:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
right well white bagging is when the
 
04:14:25.250 --> 04:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
medication is shipped by your Pharmacy
 
04:14:26.689 --> 04:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
Benefit Plan
 
04:14:29.389 --> 04:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
to the infusion center in advance of
 
04:14:31.849 --> 04:14:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:31.859 --> 04:14:34.070 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:14:36.889 --> 04:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
okay hope I wasn't out of order already
 
04:14:39.530 --> 04:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
I just barely got here I just had to
 
04:14:43.969 --> 04:14:43.979 align:start position:0%
move into the space Oh okay welcome
 
04:14:47.030 --> 04:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
anyhow so white banking is when you are
 
04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
when you arrive to your effusion
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
treatment and your infusion uh therapy
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
has been shipped ahead of you
 
04:14:56.880 --> 04:14:58.490 align:start position:0%
has been shipped ahead of you
um

04:14:58.490 --> 04:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:02.090 --> 04:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
and the patient gets there and finds the
 
04:15:03.950 --> 04:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
treatment has been shipped ahead of them
 
04:15:07.130 --> 04:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
Brown bagging is when that infusion is
 
04:15:09.769 --> 04:15:09.779 align:start position:0%
shipped to the patient's home and the
 
04:15:12.170 --> 04:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
patient is required to bring it with
 
04:15:14.269 --> 04:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
them to the treatment center
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
so you probably have already figured out
 
04:15:18.590 --> 04:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
that brown bagging has some inherent
 
04:15:18.600 --> 04:15:19.610 align:start position:0%
that brown bagging has some inherent
risk

04:15:19.610 --> 04:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
risk
 
04:15:22.130 --> 04:15:22.140 align:start position:0%
anybody had a problem with I don't know
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
an Amazon delivery maybe not making it
 
04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
there on time or a Last Mile courier
 
04:15:30.110 --> 04:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
delivery service if you know what
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
LaserShip have you ever had a tracking
 
04:15:33.229 --> 04:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
number that started with ls that's a
 
04:15:33.239 --> 04:15:34.370 align:start position:0%
number that started with ls that's a
LaserShip

04:15:34.370 --> 04:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
LaserShip
 
04:15:36.349 --> 04:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
they're right out of Woburn their last
 
04:15:38.330 --> 04:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
mile delivery Courier Service
 
04:15:40.550 --> 04:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
if you've ever had a blue apron shipment
 
04:15:42.830 --> 04:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
get spoiled on you
 
04:15:45.170 --> 04:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
um or any other last mile Courier
 
04:15:47.870 --> 04:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
Service so some of those things or if
 
04:15:49.969 --> 04:15:49.979 align:start position:0%
you're just stressed managing you or
 
04:15:51.469 --> 04:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
your loved ones cancer treatment and
 
04:15:52.790 --> 04:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
you've got enough on your mind and you
 
04:15:55.849 --> 04:15:55.859 align:start position:0%
maybe aren't expecting your infusion
 
04:15:57.710 --> 04:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
treatment to arrive that particular day
 
04:15:59.269 --> 04:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
you went away for the weekend took a
 
04:16:01.370 --> 04:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
long weekend or something like that now
 
04:16:02.630 --> 04:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
you may hear that there are some
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
controls in place and there are that's
 
04:16:08.929 --> 04:16:08.939 align:start position:0%
true but nothing's perfect nothing's
 
04:16:11.030 --> 04:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
perfect but it's when your when it's
 
04:16:12.889 --> 04:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
your cancer treatment or your loved
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
one's cancer treatment you know what I
 
04:16:18.410 --> 04:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
want my chemotherapy drug
 
04:16:20.389 --> 04:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
and that treatment and that standard of
 
04:16:22.130 --> 04:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
care to be perfect
 
04:16:24.650 --> 04:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
I want it to arrive on time when it's
 
04:16:26.510 --> 04:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be on time and I don't want
 
04:16:28.070 --> 04:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
to hear the guy on the other end of the
 
04:16:31.370 --> 04:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
LaserShip or whoever any Courier to tell
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
me it was a weather delay or it
 
04:16:37.309 --> 04:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have arrived in July and sat
 
04:16:39.290 --> 04:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
on the porch I really don't want any
 
04:16:39.300 --> 04:16:40.429 align:start position:0%
on the porch I really don't want any
excuses

04:16:40.429 --> 04:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
excuses
 
04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
right so I don't want Brown bagging to
 
04:16:45.050 --> 04:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
happen and I least of all don't want it
 
04:16:47.750 --> 04:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
to be imposed upon me because it's a
 
04:16:49.790 --> 04:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
cost-saving measure under any
 
04:16:49.800 --> 04:16:51.469 align:start position:0%
cost-saving measure under any
circumstances

04:16:51.469 --> 04:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
04:16:53.689 --> 04:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
That's My Philosophy when it comes to
 
04:16:56.870 --> 04:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
patient safety and affordability in New
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when it comes to cancer
 
04:16:59.330 --> 04:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
treatment patients and it's not just
 
04:16:59.340 --> 04:17:00.410 align:start position:0%
treatment patients and it's not just
cancer

04:17:00.410 --> 04:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
04:17:01.790 --> 04:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
there's a number of different types of
 
04:17:03.950 --> 04:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
infusion therapy where Brown bagging
 
04:17:03.960 --> 04:17:08.389 align:start position:0%
infusion therapy where Brown bagging
applies

04:17:08.389 --> 04:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:10.429 --> 04:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
point of clarification
 
04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
you want white bagging right is that
 
04:17:14.689 --> 04:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
what you want so there are two types of
 
04:17:17.389 --> 04:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
you said Brown bagging there's two types
 
04:17:20.630 --> 04:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
of of issues of practices that this
 
04:17:22.429 --> 04:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
legislation addresses Brown bagging and
 
04:17:24.229 --> 04:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
white bagging I understand and in
 
04:17:25.969 --> 04:17:25.979 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill which I'm
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
going to get to so if you bear with me I
 
04:17:29.210 --> 04:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
will get to it to Representative Vincent
 
04:17:31.250 --> 04:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
I will represent Vincent right sorry
 
04:17:34.010 --> 04:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you placards
 
04:17:36.170 --> 04:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
right I will get to it uh White bagging
 
04:17:38.269 --> 04:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
and brown bagging are both addressed and
 
04:17:40.189 --> 04:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
actually Brown bagging there is still a
 
04:17:41.870 --> 04:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
carve out if the patient and the
 
04:17:44.510 --> 04:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
provider both consent to it and there's
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
a couple ways we can deal with it in the
 
04:17:47.750 --> 04:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
current language the current Amendment
 
04:17:49.189 --> 04:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
replaces all after the enacting Clause
 
04:17:51.229 --> 04:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
that you got today allows for the
 
04:17:53.210 --> 04:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
patient and the prescriber to consent to
 
04:17:54.530 --> 04:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
it there are a couple limited cases
 
04:17:56.150 --> 04:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
where you may still want actually Brown
 
04:17:59.689 --> 04:17:59.699 align:start position:0%
bagging a rural case and an informed
 
04:18:01.790 --> 04:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
patient like so let's say I'm fairly
 
04:18:01.800 --> 04:18:02.750 align:start position:0%
patient like so let's say I'm fairly
knowledgeable

04:18:02.750 --> 04:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable
 
04:18:04.370 --> 04:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
I've been a healthy been in healthcare a
 
04:18:06.590 --> 04:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
while and I may be on the lookout and I
 
04:18:08.689 --> 04:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
may need that to be shipped to my house
 
04:18:11.809 --> 04:18:11.819 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons right so we may
 
04:18:13.250 --> 04:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
still want to allow that and that's the
 
04:18:16.250 --> 04:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way consent knowledgeable
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
right but I would not want it to happen
 
04:18:21.050 --> 04:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
for a non-knowledgeable patient and I
 
04:18:22.729 --> 04:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want it to be imposed upon you
 
04:18:24.650 --> 04:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
I want it to be your choice right
 
04:18:25.969 --> 04:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
Freedom of Choice that's a good thing
 
04:18:28.250 --> 04:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
that's New Hampshire right
 
04:18:31.370 --> 04:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
so but in in general
 
04:18:33.650 --> 04:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
um the this bill addresses both white
 
04:18:35.990 --> 04:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
bagging and brown bagging for white
 
04:18:39.710 --> 04:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
bagging we would like I would I think in
 
04:18:43.010 --> 04:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
general it's a good idea if we do it and
 
04:18:47.150 --> 04:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
we avoid the proverbial 600 aspirin we
 
04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
Bill we have the the plans bill under
 
04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
the more economical Pharmacy benefit as
 
04:18:56.210 --> 04:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
opposed to the medical benefit the 600
 
04:18:58.610 --> 04:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
aspirin and I'm gonna get to that too
 
04:18:58.620 --> 04:19:00.469 align:start position:0%
aspirin and I'm gonna get to that too
okay

04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:19:04.070 --> 04:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
um so the the safe the unsafe and
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
impractical problems are created in uh
 
04:19:10.370 --> 04:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
the the brown bagging and sometimes in
 
04:19:12.290 --> 04:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
white bagging so let me get back to the
 
04:19:14.510 --> 04:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
white bagging situation where it can be
 
04:19:16.389 --> 04:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
safe and improv unsafe and impractical
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
here in Concord just Concord for example
 
04:19:23.210 --> 04:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
the conquered Cancer Treatment Center
 
04:19:26.150 --> 04:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
the practice is you arrive for your
 
04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy infusion treatment your
 
04:19:30.769 --> 04:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy has sent white bag has sent it
 
04:19:31.910 --> 04:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
in advance
 
04:19:31.920 --> 04:19:33.290 align:start position:0%
in advance
and

04:19:33.290 --> 04:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:37.429 --> 04:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
you show up your oncologist orders labs
 
04:19:39.410 --> 04:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
who hasn't heard of this practice you
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
show up get Labs ordered you have your
 
04:19:44.150 --> 04:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
white count checked your liver function
 
04:19:46.729 --> 04:19:46.739 align:start position:0%
checked your kidney function checked and
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
today your labs are a little bit off
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
so your medical oncologist decides you
 
04:19:54.410 --> 04:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
need a slightly different mix than what
 
04:19:56.030 --> 04:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
was ordered
 
04:19:58.729 --> 04:19:58.739 align:start position:0%
so he orders a different cocktail
 
04:20:02.210 --> 04:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
now they go and check what's arrived and
 
04:20:04.130 --> 04:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
it's not quite the right cocktail you
 
04:20:05.410 --> 04:20:05.420 align:start position:0%
have two options
 
04:20:08.030 --> 04:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
allow your tumor to grow inside you
 
04:20:09.290 --> 04:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
another week while they ship you another
 
04:20:11.990 --> 04:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
cocktail or
 
04:20:15.309 --> 04:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
right you get the idea
 
04:20:17.809 --> 04:20:17.819 align:start position:0%
there's different types
 
04:20:20.210 --> 04:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
of cancer therapy sometimes you get
 
04:20:20.220 --> 04:20:21.290 align:start position:0%
of cancer therapy sometimes you get
chemo

04:20:21.290 --> 04:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
chemo
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
say for triple negative breast cancer
 
04:20:25.849 --> 04:20:25.859 align:start position:0%
standard of care may be to have chemo
 
04:20:28.130 --> 04:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
first before surgery shrink the tumor
 
04:20:30.410 --> 04:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
first before they go in and take it out
 
04:20:33.530 --> 04:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have chemotherapy after
 
04:20:36.769 --> 04:20:36.779 align:start position:0%
surgery right it depends it's a there's
 
04:20:39.050 --> 04:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
very specialized types of cancer
 
04:20:41.269 --> 04:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
treatment it all depends so imagine
 
04:20:43.130 --> 04:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
you're faced with that decision to make
 
04:20:45.170 --> 04:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
your oncologist is faced with that
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
decision to make use what they sent you
 
04:20:49.250 --> 04:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
or wait a week
 
04:20:51.229 --> 04:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
right these are very difficult decisions
 
04:20:53.929 --> 04:20:53.939 align:start position:0%
to make and I've known plenty you know
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
not not as in my family but outside of
 
04:20:56.929 --> 04:20:56.939 align:start position:0%
my family everybody knows somebody who's
 
04:20:58.130 --> 04:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
gone through chemo right I'm sure
 
04:20:59.870 --> 04:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
everybody around this table has so
 
04:21:02.150 --> 04:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
anyways you get the idea these are
 
04:21:04.849 --> 04:21:04.859 align:start position:0%
challenging decisions and that's what
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
this bill aims to address but even more
 
04:21:09.650 --> 04:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
importantly I mean maybe not arguably
 
04:21:11.510 --> 04:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
not more importantly than the safety
 
04:21:14.210 --> 04:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
issue it's the waste that's generated
 
04:21:17.150 --> 04:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
now you've got this expensive drug
 
04:21:19.130 --> 04:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
that's going to go in the bin
 
04:21:21.530 --> 04:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
that costs all of us money the Whole
 
04:21:23.809 --> 04:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
Health Care System money that diverts
 
04:21:26.030 --> 04:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's why we have to do something now I
 
04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
know there's going to be discussion
 
04:21:29.630 --> 04:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
about retaining this bill work on it you
 
04:21:31.849 --> 04:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
know uh maybe change a little bit of
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
language about an opt-in practice here
 
04:21:34.790 --> 04:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's another amendment I was handed by
 
04:21:35.809 --> 04:21:35.819 align:start position:0%
one of the interested parties and
 
04:21:37.250 --> 04:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
actually it's a good it's a it's a good
 
04:21:39.229 --> 04:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment but it's a small one and I
 
04:21:41.150 --> 04:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
think we can probably take care of this
 
04:21:43.370 --> 04:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
if the committee is of a mind we can
 
04:21:44.689 --> 04:21:44.699 align:start position:0%
work together and probably get a bill
 
04:21:48.469 --> 04:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
out so anyways I I can go on and talk a
 
04:21:49.610 --> 04:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
little bit about the fiscal note
 
04:21:49.620 --> 04:21:50.990 align:start position:0%
little bit about the fiscal note
methodology

04:21:50.990 --> 04:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
04:21:51.000 --> 04:21:51.590 align:start position:0%
methodology
um

04:21:51.590 --> 04:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:53.570 --> 04:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk about some more of the
 
04:21:55.189 --> 04:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
affordability aspect
 
04:21:57.170 --> 04:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
but I'm just going to sum it up and and
 
04:21:59.750 --> 04:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for your care and transport
 
04:22:01.849 --> 04:22:01.859 align:start position:0%
of this bill to the house floor uh
 
04:22:04.250 --> 04:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
sometime fairly soon there's some some
 
04:22:05.990 --> 04:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
vital issues to be addressed and I think
 
04:22:07.490 --> 04:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
we can do it and I want to just take
 
04:22:09.290 --> 04:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
some of your questions because I think
 
04:22:11.330 --> 04:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
you probably have a few
 
04:22:12.410 --> 04:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
okay we do have a question
 
04:22:14.150 --> 04:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative Vinson thank you Mr
 
04:22:16.189 --> 04:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks again for taking my
 
04:22:18.590 --> 04:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
question so um
 
04:22:20.990 --> 04:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
so this whole white bagging Brown
 
04:22:23.150 --> 04:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
bagging it doesn't apply to all
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals because I'm pretty sure I have
 
04:22:28.250 --> 04:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
a good friend of mine and his wife works
 
04:22:30.110 --> 04:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
at Wentworth Douglas and they actually
 
04:22:32.330 --> 04:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
make their own cocktails there is that
 
04:22:32.340 --> 04:22:33.650 align:start position:0%
make their own cocktails there is that
true

04:22:33.650 --> 04:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:22:35.929 --> 04:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
um that's very very possible they it is
 
04:22:37.309 --> 04:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
definitely possible that they may make
 
04:22:39.170 --> 04:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
their own the question is what do they
 
04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
charge for those and do they bill under
 
04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
the medical benefit the 600 aspirin
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
potentially or do they build under the
 
04:22:49.070 --> 04:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
pharmacy benefit this bill will
 
04:22:51.530 --> 04:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
um uh require that they bill under the
 
04:22:54.110 --> 04:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
most efficient way and that's the
 
04:22:55.849 --> 04:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
language that you see
 
04:22:59.929 --> 04:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
in uh uh section
 
04:23:02.570 --> 04:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
two it's a line 15 of the amendment
 
04:23:03.889 --> 04:23:03.899 align:start position:0%
right you should have the amendment
 
04:23:03.899 --> 04:23:06.410 align:start position:0%
right you should have the amendment
0532h

04:23:06.410 --> 04:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
0532h
 
04:23:08.269 --> 04:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
section two
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
starting line 15 A and B so that's what
 
04:23:13.309 --> 04:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
requires them to bill in the most
 
04:23:17.090 --> 04:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
efficient manner right so under Pharmacy
 
04:23:20.090 --> 04:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
benefit versus medical benefit so we do
 
04:23:21.469 --> 04:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
want them
 
04:23:24.170 --> 04:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
to mix their own custom cocktail that's
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
exactly what they do over here right
 
04:23:28.550 --> 04:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
here in Concord
 
04:23:31.370 --> 04:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
um and and many for the standard of care
 
04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
they mix their own custom they check the
 
04:23:36.410 --> 04:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
labs mix it you know soup du jour if you
 
04:23:37.849 --> 04:23:37.859 align:start position:0%
will right sure
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
and that's the best best practice we
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
want that to happen thank you
 
04:23:45.290 --> 04:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
representative spear
 
04:23:48.830 --> 04:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
so in the cases where the billing
 
04:23:51.110 --> 04:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
is done under the medical benefit who
 
04:23:52.910 --> 04:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
makes that decision as to how it gets
 
04:23:54.530 --> 04:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
billed ah thank you for your question
 
04:23:57.650 --> 04:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
that's a great question uh it is the
 
04:24:00.110 --> 04:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
folks who are at the top of that billing
 
04:24:02.269 --> 04:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
food chain and would very much like to
 
04:24:04.250 --> 04:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
maximize the profits of that hospital so
 
04:24:06.769 --> 04:24:06.779 align:start position:0%
the question might be you might be
 
04:24:10.370 --> 04:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
wondering who loses in this in this bill
 
04:24:12.110 --> 04:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
um and that's also a good good question
 
04:24:14.689 --> 04:24:14.699 align:start position:0%
and they're definitely
 
04:24:14.699 --> 04:24:16.010 align:start position:0%
and they're definitely
um

04:24:16.010 --> 04:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
the hospital the hospitals the hospitals
 
04:24:21.229 --> 04:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
might might be
 
04:24:24.170 --> 04:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
uh suffering a bit of a
 
04:24:26.389 --> 04:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
refocus of their profit model on this
 
04:24:27.889 --> 04:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
because they're not going to be allowed
 
04:24:30.790 --> 04:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
to Bill 600 for an aspirin
 
04:24:33.349 --> 04:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire
 
04:24:33.359 --> 04:24:35.150 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire
uh

04:24:35.150 --> 04:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:39.429 --> 04:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
how did the pbms do they get a better
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
rebate as a result of going through the
 
04:24:44.330 --> 04:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
medical or do they are they ambivalent
 
04:24:45.830 --> 04:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
to the whole thing
 
04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
well I'm sure you're going to hear from
 
04:24:49.790 --> 04:24:49.800 align:start position:0%

so good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
04:28:05.389 --> 04:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:28:08.510 --> 04:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
Tanya Carlton I am the president-elect
 
04:28:10.429 --> 04:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Society of Health
 
04:28:13.670 --> 04:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
System pharmacists which represents all
 
04:28:15.469 --> 04:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
pharmacists that work in the hospitals
 
04:28:18.710 --> 04:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:21.469 --> 04:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
and Tanya is here to be the subject
 
04:28:24.110 --> 04:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
matter expert as a practicing pharmacist
 
04:28:27.469 --> 04:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
and working in a health system so if we
 
04:28:30.229 --> 04:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
do receive questions certainly I can um
 
04:28:32.750 --> 04:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
pass them on to Tanya
 
04:28:34.309 --> 04:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
um for the record the New Hampshire
 
04:28:36.349 --> 04:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association is not taking a
 
04:28:38.450 --> 04:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
position on House Bill 513 right now
 
04:28:40.969 --> 04:28:40.979 align:start position:0%
however we believe it is important to
 
04:28:43.309 --> 04:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
provide background and education on this
 
04:28:45.889 --> 04:28:45.899 align:start position:0%
topic to this committee as hospitals are
 
04:28:48.050 --> 04:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
impacted by the policies raised in this
 
04:28:50.689 --> 04:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
legislation it is not completely clear
 
04:28:53.090 --> 04:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
to us what the sponsor was attempting to
 
04:28:55.729 --> 04:28:55.739 align:start position:0%
do with House Bill 513 what we believe
 
04:28:57.170 --> 04:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
he was trying to address something
 
04:28:59.210 --> 04:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
called Brown bagging of specialized
 
04:29:01.910 --> 04:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals I did hear his testimony
 
04:29:03.889 --> 04:29:03.899 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor of the bill also saying
 
04:29:05.870 --> 04:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
it was related to White bagging we're
 
04:29:09.309 --> 04:29:09.319 align:start position:0%
not clear how it applies to both but um
 
04:29:11.809 --> 04:29:11.819 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do here today is to
 
04:29:13.189 --> 04:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
provide background information about
 
04:29:15.649 --> 04:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
both those practices
 
04:29:17.689 --> 04:29:17.699 align:start position:0%
and he also testified that appears the
 
04:29:19.010 --> 04:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
bill would change reimbursement
 
04:29:20.929 --> 04:29:20.939 align:start position:0%
processes for how specialized
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals are billed to insurance
 
04:29:24.170 --> 04:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
companies but again the language was
 
04:29:27.469 --> 04:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
unclear he did share a copy of his
 
04:29:29.269 --> 04:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment with us right before the
 
04:29:31.550 --> 04:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
hearing so we have not had a chance to
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
take a look at the impact of the what
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
that Amendment could do
 
04:29:37.849 --> 04:29:37.859 align:start position:0%
we do appreciate that the sponsor has
 
04:29:39.889 --> 04:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
raised such an important policy topic
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
which is how insurance companies are
 
04:29:44.450 --> 04:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
modifying access to specialized drugs
 
04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
which could negatively impact both
 
04:29:49.370 --> 04:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
patients and providers and here's the
 
04:29:51.830 --> 04:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
background on those practices
 
04:29:53.750 --> 04:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
white bagging and brown bagging are
 
04:29:56.090 --> 04:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
insurer created practices that
 
04:29:57.950 --> 04:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
circumvent proper federal and state
 
04:30:00.769 --> 04:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
requirements for drug management drug
 
04:30:03.649 --> 04:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
inventories and Drug waste handling
 
04:30:05.990 --> 04:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
white bagging is when the insurer orders
 
04:30:08.689 --> 04:30:08.699 align:start position:0%
drugs from their own Specialty Pharmacy
 
04:30:11.689 --> 04:30:11.699 align:start position:0%
sends it to a hospital or provider
 
04:30:13.490 --> 04:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
where the patient receives their
 
04:30:13.500 --> 04:30:14.809 align:start position:0%
where the patient receives their
medication

04:30:14.809 --> 04:30:14.819 align:start position:0%
medication
 
04:30:16.849 --> 04:30:16.859 align:start position:0%
Brown bagging is when the insurer orders
 
04:30:18.410 --> 04:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
drugs from their own Specialty Pharmacy
 
04:30:21.050 --> 04:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
and sends it to the patient's home and
 
04:30:22.670 --> 04:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
makes the patient bring that medication
 
04:30:25.309 --> 04:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
to the hospital or provider for an
 
04:30:28.670 --> 04:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
Administration in a health care setting
 
04:30:31.130 --> 04:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
we at the hospital Association have
 
04:30:33.530 --> 04:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
learned of many many patient experiences
 
04:30:36.170 --> 04:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
from our member hospitals where insurer
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
required white bagging and brown bagging
 
04:30:40.550 --> 04:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
practices have caused delays in
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
treatment due to drugs not arriving on
 
04:30:43.199 --> 04:30:44.030 align:start position:0%
treatment due to drugs not arriving on
time

04:30:44.030 --> 04:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
wrong drugs being delivered or the
 
04:30:49.010 --> 04:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
hospital pharmacist not being able to
 
04:30:51.170 --> 04:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
verify that the drugs were kept at
 
04:30:52.729 --> 04:30:52.739 align:start position:0%
proper temperatures throughout the
 
04:30:54.710 --> 04:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
entire shipping process
 
04:30:56.929 --> 04:30:56.939 align:start position:0%
the insurers contend that white bagging
 
04:30:58.790 --> 04:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
and brown bagging save money
 
04:31:01.189 --> 04:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
it's our position that this practice May
 
04:31:03.889 --> 04:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
save money for them but not for their
 
04:31:06.110 --> 04:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
members who are subjected to canceled
 
04:31:09.110 --> 04:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
appointments missed work and missed
 
04:31:10.969 --> 04:31:10.979 align:start position:0%
critical treatments because their
 
04:31:14.030 --> 04:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
insurer Supply drugs didn't arrive on
 
04:31:16.429 --> 04:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
time were simply the wrong medication
 
04:31:18.889 --> 04:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
for the patient or were damaged in
 
04:31:18.899 --> 04:31:19.849 align:start position:0%
for the patient or were damaged in
shipment

04:31:19.849 --> 04:31:19.859 align:start position:0%
shipment
 
04:31:21.649 --> 04:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
it also costs the Health Care System
 
04:31:24.349 --> 04:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
money in handling drugs that are not
 
04:31:26.809 --> 04:31:26.819 align:start position:0%
part of their own inventory due to the
 
04:31:28.910 --> 04:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
fact that they have to store them and
 
04:31:31.250 --> 04:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
waste them if the wrong drugs were
 
04:31:31.260 --> 04:31:33.530 align:start position:0%
waste them if the wrong drugs were
shipped

04:31:33.530 --> 04:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
shipped
 
04:31:33.540 --> 04:31:34.849 align:start position:0%
shipped
hmm

04:31:34.849 --> 04:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
04:31:37.370 --> 04:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
in many cases patients must have lab
 
04:31:38.929 --> 04:31:38.939 align:start position:0%
work done on the day of their treatments
 
04:31:41.389 --> 04:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
especially cancer patients that will
 
04:31:43.070 --> 04:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
translate to very specific drug
 
04:31:45.349 --> 04:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
requirements that get prepared that day
 
04:31:47.809 --> 04:31:47.819 align:start position:0%
all of which means that white bagging
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
and brown bagging can't be used because
 
04:31:52.610 --> 04:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
those drugs have made up several days in
 
04:31:52.620 --> 04:31:53.750 align:start position:0%
those drugs have made up several days in
advance

04:31:53.750 --> 04:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
advance
 
04:31:55.969 --> 04:31:55.979 align:start position:0%
the growth in specialty pharmacies is
 
04:31:57.950 --> 04:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
driven by insurance companies and not
 
04:32:00.710 --> 04:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals only one Hospital in New
 
04:32:03.170 --> 04:32:03.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire manages a specialty pharmacy
 
04:32:05.210 --> 04:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
that Specialty Pharmacy integrates
 
04:32:07.309 --> 04:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
pharmacists with providers into Clinic
 
04:32:09.769 --> 04:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
sites which means that access to
 
04:32:12.769 --> 04:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
medications is provided in real time to
 
04:32:16.010 --> 04:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
optimize proper dosages and Therapies
 
04:32:18.050 --> 04:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
some insurers own their own specialty
 
04:32:20.689 --> 04:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
pharmacies and are requiring their use
 
04:32:22.910 --> 04:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
by their members and the health care
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
providers in their Networks
 
04:32:27.530 --> 04:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
another Trend we see nationally are that
 
04:32:29.210 --> 04:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
insurers are moving prescription drug
 
04:32:31.370 --> 04:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
costs from medical benefit to a
 
04:32:33.950 --> 04:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
prescription drug benefit as we have all
 
04:32:36.229 --> 04:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
seen members are paying more out of
 
04:32:39.110 --> 04:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
pocket because prescription drugs paid
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
under a pharmacy drug benefit typically
 
04:32:44.929 --> 04:32:44.939 align:start position:0%
have higher deductibles and co-pays
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
the tension that exists between
 
04:32:48.349 --> 04:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers in the insurance
 
04:32:50.689 --> 04:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
industry concerning the provision of
 
04:32:52.790 --> 04:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
Highly specialized medications is
 
04:32:55.010 --> 04:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
significant the hospitals and health
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
care providers are focused on the
 
04:32:58.370 --> 04:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
delivery of the highest quality of care
 
04:33:01.130 --> 04:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
and the safest manner possible while the
 
04:33:02.929 --> 04:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
insurance industry is primarily focused
 
04:33:05.449 --> 04:33:05.459 align:start position:0%
on the cost of those drugs
 
04:33:07.551 --> 04:33:07.561 align:start position:0%
I've attached a document to my testimony
 
04:33:09.230 --> 04:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
that helps explain the white backing
 
04:33:12.170 --> 04:33:12.180 align:start position:0%
practice in more detail the schematic
 
04:33:13.910 --> 04:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
clearly illustrates the ways in which
 
04:33:16.670 --> 04:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
white bagging interrupts the flow of
 
04:33:18.289 --> 04:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
quality patient care
 
04:33:20.209 --> 04:33:20.219 align:start position:0%
well I don't have a schematic specific
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
to Brown bagging it would be very
 
04:33:23.631 --> 04:33:23.641 align:start position:0%
similar except that the insurance
 
04:33:25.551 --> 04:33:25.561 align:start position:0%
company sends the medications to the
 
04:33:27.650 --> 04:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
patient's home and requires the patient
 
04:33:29.510 --> 04:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
to bring those medications to their
 
04:33:29.520 --> 04:33:30.650 align:start position:0%
to bring those medications to their
provider

04:33:30.650 --> 04:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
provider
 
04:33:33.470 --> 04:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
to be clear the hospitals are advocating
 
04:33:35.810 --> 04:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
that brown bagging medications should be
 
04:33:35.820 --> 04:33:37.010 align:start position:0%
that brown bagging medications should be
prohibited

04:33:37.010 --> 04:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
04:33:38.869 --> 04:33:38.879 align:start position:0%
white backing medications should be
 
04:33:40.730 --> 04:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
prohibited when dosage and or
 
04:33:43.250 --> 04:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
compounding are dependent upon current
 
04:33:45.349 --> 04:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
patient lab results or clinical
 
04:33:47.449 --> 04:33:47.459 align:start position:0%
presentations at the time of medication
 
04:33:47.459 --> 04:33:49.369 align:start position:0%
presentations at the time of medication
administration

04:33:49.369 --> 04:33:49.379 align:start position:0%
administration
 
04:33:51.590 --> 04:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
white begging medications should only be
 
04:33:53.869 --> 04:33:53.879 align:start position:0%
considered when quality and safety
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
criteria are met and mutually agreed
 
04:33:59.090 --> 04:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
upon standards are applied including
 
04:34:01.189 --> 04:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
that the joint decision between the
 
04:34:03.890 --> 04:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
provider and the payer that a white
 
04:34:05.689 --> 04:34:05.699 align:start position:0%
bagging medication is in the best
 
04:34:07.849 --> 04:34:07.859 align:start position:0%
interest of the patient

House Bill 513 while it appears to
 
04:34:11.929 --> 04:34:11.939 align:start position:0%
tackle some of our concerns about Brown
 
04:34:14.869 --> 04:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
bagging doesn't go far enough and may
 
04:34:16.670 --> 04:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
even complicate situations with how
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
Brown bagging could be used and then how
 
04:34:20.449 --> 04:34:20.459 align:start position:0%
it's paid for
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
due to the complexity of this important
 
04:34:25.070 --> 04:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
topic we are unsure that house bill 513
 
04:34:27.529 --> 04:34:27.539 align:start position:0%
is the right vehicle to properly address
 
04:34:29.390 --> 04:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
this practice
 
04:34:31.131 --> 04:34:31.141 align:start position:0%
we hope that this information is helpful
 
04:34:34.010 --> 04:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
to you and we're very open for questions
 
04:34:35.929 --> 04:34:35.939 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:40.670 --> 04:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Hillary Clinton collabro
 
04:34:42.470 --> 04:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
um I guess
 
04:34:44.269 --> 04:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
I wasn't really clear about the
 
04:34:47.029 --> 04:34:47.039 align:start position:0%
intention behind the bill and as
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
somebody who's ordered both Brown and
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
and what and I can justify this having
 
04:34:55.131 --> 04:34:55.141 align:start position:0%
ordered both for my patients so I I
 
04:34:57.051 --> 04:34:57.061 align:start position:0%
guess I didn't really understand what it
 
04:34:59.209 --> 04:34:59.219 align:start position:0%
was that we were trying to control and
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
my guess was that we were trying to I
 
04:35:04.609 --> 04:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
guess I'm asking are we trying to
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
control the billing
 
04:35:10.010 --> 04:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
rate in which we are getting P's for
 
04:35:11.449 --> 04:35:11.459 align:start position:0%
service like we're going to do it
 
04:35:13.131 --> 04:35:13.141 align:start position:0%
through the farm benefit rather than the
 
04:35:15.410 --> 04:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
medical benefit
 
04:35:18.051 --> 04:35:18.061 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't understand
 
04:35:18.061 --> 04:35:19.429 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't understand
what

04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:35:19.439 --> 04:35:20.390 align:start position:0%
what
yeah

04:35:20.390 --> 04:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:35:22.189 --> 04:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
representative we also didn't understand
 
04:35:24.170 --> 04:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill to be able to I
 
04:35:25.670 --> 04:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
think you would have to ask the sponsor
 
04:35:27.349 --> 04:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
what the true we will take it up in
 
04:35:29.631 --> 04:35:29.641 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I appreciate it I
 
04:35:33.250 --> 04:35:33.260 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you thank you okay
 
04:35:33.260 --> 04:35:34.810 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you thank you okay
any

04:35:34.810 --> 04:35:34.820 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:35:38.269 --> 04:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
representative spear
 
04:35:41.090 --> 04:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
so I understand what you're saying uh
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
but in the cases where I mean how many
 
04:35:47.631 --> 04:35:47.641 align:start position:0%
hospitals could actually compound or
 
04:35:50.449 --> 04:35:50.459 align:start position:0%
make the drug that might be needed I
 
04:35:52.849 --> 04:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
mean is that so white begging may not be
 
04:35:55.609 --> 04:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
totally eliminated right or can you
 
04:35:59.689 --> 04:35:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:02.090 --> 04:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
04:36:05.209 --> 04:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
many hospitals have started to move in
 
04:36:06.890 --> 04:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
the direction where they are they have
 
04:36:09.109 --> 04:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
policies or are trying to eliminate
 
04:36:10.390 --> 04:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
white bagging
 
04:36:12.949 --> 04:36:12.959 align:start position:0%
hospitals have formularies in which they
 
04:36:15.650 --> 04:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
have certain medications of what they
 
04:36:17.830 --> 04:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
can administer so
 
04:36:21.289 --> 04:36:21.299 align:start position:0%
we do our best to try to go through the
 
04:36:23.330 --> 04:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to
 
04:36:25.250 --> 04:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
ensure we have the appropriate prior
 
04:36:27.289 --> 04:36:27.299 align:start position:0%
approvals to get the medication that's
 
04:36:30.189 --> 04:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
best that is able to treat the patient
 
04:36:32.990 --> 04:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
in the setting I know there was a
 
04:36:34.970 --> 04:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
question earlier about white bagging and
 
04:36:36.349 --> 04:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's happening at local
 
04:36:38.330 --> 04:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
hospitals it does happen at local
 
04:36:40.910 --> 04:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals and so the medication is
 
04:36:44.090 --> 04:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
is sent to the hospital and then the
 
04:36:46.429 --> 04:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
hospital has it in an inventory we need
 
04:36:48.529 --> 04:36:48.539 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it is stored
 
04:36:51.170 --> 04:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
appropriately and then the pharmacy
 
04:36:51.180 --> 04:36:52.551 align:start position:0%
appropriately and then the pharmacy
personnel

04:36:52.551 --> 04:36:52.561 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
04:36:55.070 --> 04:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
ensures that it meets the criteria for
 
04:36:57.890 --> 04:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
the patient to receive it but prepares
 
04:37:00.490 --> 04:37:00.500 align:start position:0%
that medication as well
 
04:37:03.650 --> 04:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
for the patient and so I think what your
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
question was sorry if I went a little
 
04:37:07.369 --> 04:37:07.379 align:start position:0%
sideways there was
 
04:37:10.429 --> 04:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
can hospitals provide the medications to
 
04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
the patients absolutely follow one for
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
the question may inquire thank you so
 
04:37:17.039 --> 04:37:21.470 align:start position:0%
the question may inquire thank you so
much

04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:24.769 --> 04:37:24.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:27.949 --> 04:37:27.959 align:start position:0%
but if you're getting the medications
 
04:37:30.310 --> 04:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you have the same problem about
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh making sure they get to you in the
 
04:37:35.150 --> 04:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
right condition like how do you know
 
04:37:36.769 --> 04:37:36.779 align:start position:0%
that the mailing or whatever that
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
they're sending do you test it or
 
04:37:40.849 --> 04:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
anything we don't that's why
 
04:37:40.859 --> 04:37:41.570 align:start position:0%
anything we don't that's why
um

04:37:41.570 --> 04:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:45.410 --> 04:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
you know the national organizations
 
04:37:48.349 --> 04:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
such as ashp and American Hospital
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
Association also are not supportive of
 
04:37:54.410 --> 04:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
white bagging because they could get
 
04:37:57.470 --> 04:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
left on a loading dock it could be
 
04:38:01.369 --> 04:38:01.379 align:start position:0%
you know left out in the Heat or the
 
04:38:03.769 --> 04:38:03.779 align:start position:0%
cold or it may not be delivered in time
 
04:38:06.730 --> 04:38:06.740 align:start position:0%
so there's many examples that I have
 
04:38:09.769 --> 04:38:09.779 align:start position:0%
where the medication never made it to
 
04:38:12.769 --> 04:38:12.779 align:start position:0%
the hospital and so therefore the
 
04:38:16.131 --> 04:38:16.141 align:start position:0%
decision is made do you use your own the
 
04:38:18.949 --> 04:38:18.959 align:start position:0%
medication from the hospital supply or
 
04:38:23.529 --> 04:38:23.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:26.810 --> 04:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:29.631 --> 04:38:29.641 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so my question is if
 
04:38:30.650 --> 04:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
04:38:32.390 --> 04:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
are against this
 
04:38:34.670 --> 04:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
how are the patients getting it through
 
04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
the mail they must be ordering it for
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
them to go to their home so not every
 
04:38:43.310 --> 04:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
single Hospital have policies and
 
04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
procedures against Brown bagging white
 
04:38:49.250 --> 04:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
bagging many hospitals do allow it to
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
occur however because of the risks
 
04:38:55.910 --> 04:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
associated with the quality control of
 
04:38:58.131 --> 04:38:58.141 align:start position:0%
the medication many hospitals are
 
04:39:00.769 --> 04:39:00.779 align:start position:0%
starting to move away from this practice
 
04:39:04.070 --> 04:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
because we just can't ensure that the
 
04:39:04.080 --> 04:39:05.349 align:start position:0%
because we just can't ensure that the
medication

04:39:05.349 --> 04:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
medication
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
has been through the right quality
 
04:39:07.920 --> 04:39:09.470 align:start position:0%
has been through the right quality
control

04:39:09.470 --> 04:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:39:11.689 --> 04:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
a follow-up for the question we inquire
 
04:39:15.650 --> 04:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
yes so so if that's the case
 
04:39:19.070 --> 04:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
um where uh the medicines are are going
 
04:39:22.189 --> 04:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
to the people and and coming in has
 
04:39:24.890 --> 04:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
there been any study or any
 
04:39:28.250 --> 04:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
um statistics of how many of these drugs
 
04:39:31.070 --> 04:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
have caused a problem once they've you
 
04:39:32.750 --> 04:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
know brought it back into the hospital
 
04:39:36.650 --> 04:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
is that what's creating this I think
 
04:39:38.690 --> 04:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
what's creating it is not necessarily
 
04:39:40.550 --> 04:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
that we've necessarily I haven't seen
 
04:39:42.410 --> 04:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
any studies looking at that specifically
 
04:39:44.570 --> 04:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
but what we might see is a delay in
 
04:39:47.868 --> 04:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
patient care right because the usually
 
04:39:50.270 --> 04:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:39:51.830 --> 04:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
the providers like if they see any
 
04:39:54.050 --> 04:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
discoloration of the medication or any
 
04:39:55.910 --> 04:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the medication they're not
 
04:39:58.310 --> 04:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
going to administer that medication and
 
04:40:00.708 --> 04:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
so therefore there may be a delay in the
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
patient receiving treatment
 
04:40:06.470 --> 04:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up so
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
you already said in the hospital
 
04:40:10.570 --> 04:40:10.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes things go wrong would you say
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's more instance of it going wrong
 
04:40:16.010 --> 04:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
with patients who have brought it in
 
04:40:18.850 --> 04:40:18.860 align:start position:0%
then again is there any
 
04:40:22.368 --> 04:40:22.378 align:start position:0%
comparison and that we could look at to
 
04:40:25.090 --> 04:40:25.100 align:start position:0%
see so I would say both practices
 
04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
have their inherent issues right but if
 
04:40:31.490 --> 04:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
something is white bagged at least there
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
is some control once it does get to the
 
04:40:35.770 --> 04:40:35.780 align:start position:0%
hospital pharmacy
 
04:40:38.448 --> 04:40:38.458 align:start position:0%
we have no control over what the patient
 
04:40:41.208 --> 04:40:41.218 align:start position:0%
does with it right
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
we don't know it could be stored in
 
04:40:44.690 --> 04:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
their glove compartment for five days
 
04:40:46.490 --> 04:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
04:40:49.010 --> 04:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman there was mention
 
04:40:51.770 --> 04:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
in the testimony that this bill might
 
04:40:54.288 --> 04:40:54.298 align:start position:0%
actually complicate the problems of
 
04:40:56.630 --> 04:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
brown bagging and white begging and that
 
04:40:59.570 --> 04:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
this bill might not be the best
 
04:41:02.150 --> 04:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
um way of solving the problems could you
 
04:41:04.550 --> 04:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
tell us how this bill might complicate
 
04:41:06.948 --> 04:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
the problems and what you would propose
 
04:41:11.208 --> 04:41:11.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:13.610 --> 04:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
um when we first read the bill it
 
04:41:18.530 --> 04:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
appeared as if it was only focused on
 
04:41:21.288 --> 04:41:21.298 align:start position:0%
Brown bagging but then it was
 
04:41:24.350 --> 04:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
um not exactly clear
 
04:41:27.170 --> 04:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
from at least our perspective that It
 
04:41:29.270 --> 04:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately would apply to all brown
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
bagging and then when we heard the
 
04:41:34.250 --> 04:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
sponsor say that it applied to both
 
04:41:36.770 --> 04:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
white and brown bagging two different
 
04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
types of scenarios
 
04:41:41.090 --> 04:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
again I question how that could be so I
 
04:41:42.110 --> 04:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have to look at the
 
04:41:44.750 --> 04:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
language very clear clearly I think the
 
04:41:46.970 --> 04:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
other aspect of the bill
 
04:41:49.128 --> 04:41:49.138 align:start position:0%
um at least from the billing side of it
 
04:41:52.250 --> 04:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
looked like it was only modifying the
 
04:41:54.128 --> 04:41:54.138 align:start position:0%
Managed Care
 
04:41:58.310 --> 04:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
Insurance statutes and insurance covers
 
04:42:00.050 --> 04:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
more than just the Managed Care statute
 
04:42:02.208 --> 04:42:02.218 align:start position:0%
so I think there were several aspects to
 
04:42:04.970 --> 04:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
it that would have to be evaluated
 
04:42:08.330 --> 04:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
further question may inquire thank you
 
04:42:10.128 --> 04:42:10.138 align:start position:0%
can you tell us what you would propose
 
04:42:15.288 --> 04:42:15.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:16.670 --> 04:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this is going to
 
04:42:18.830 --> 04:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so I think that we could
 
04:42:21.650 --> 04:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
certainly you know come up with some
 
04:42:24.590 --> 04:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
suggestions and ideas clearly you know
 
04:42:26.330 --> 04:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
we know from the hospital's perspective
 
04:42:27.890 --> 04:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
that we think Brown bagging should be
 
04:42:31.310 --> 04:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
outright outright uh prohibited and only
 
04:42:33.530 --> 04:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
white bagging for limited circumstances
 
04:42:35.750 --> 04:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to look very closely at
 
04:42:37.810 --> 04:42:37.820 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
04:42:40.910 --> 04:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I I I'm gonna weigh in because
 
04:42:43.128 --> 04:42:43.138 align:start position:0%
I have a question and I've been
 
04:42:45.530 --> 04:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
patiently waiting
 
04:42:45.540 --> 04:42:46.670 align:start position:0%
patiently waiting
so

04:42:46.670 --> 04:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
this issue of
 
04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
the firm is the hospital pharmacy
 
04:42:55.730 --> 04:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
charging 400 400 percent more
 
04:42:59.030 --> 04:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
than I guess an in-network that I see in
 
04:43:02.750 --> 04:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
in the pairs preferred provider Pharmacy
 
04:43:05.208 --> 04:43:05.218 align:start position:0%
provider is this true
 
04:43:07.368 --> 04:43:07.378 align:start position:0%
are you guys really charging more just
 
04:43:11.930 --> 04:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:14.030 --> 04:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
so each Hospital right there's a there's
 
04:43:15.590 --> 04:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
a lot going on right now with price
 
04:43:18.170 --> 04:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
transparency at hospitals so each
 
04:43:20.030 --> 04:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals have their own charge master
 
04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of what they do charge and so
 
04:43:23.760 --> 04:43:24.470 align:start position:0%
in terms of what they do charge and so
um

04:43:24.470 --> 04:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:26.510 --> 04:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
there are limited things in the hospital
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
that rev you know in order to keep the
 
04:43:30.410 --> 04:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
lights on in many hospitals right now
 
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
are really struggling right this is a
 
04:43:36.830 --> 04:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
profit Center well no it's not but
 
04:43:39.050 --> 04:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
there's the other things that we do
 
04:43:41.390 --> 04:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
charge for right and so I wouldn't say
 
04:43:45.110 --> 04:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
we're up charging anything by 400 okay
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
so but are you a provider are are you
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
signing the contracts with the insurance
 
04:43:54.890 --> 04:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
company as a preferred as a pharmacy and
 
04:43:58.730 --> 04:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
agree to their pricing their their pbm's
 
04:44:00.850 --> 04:44:00.860 align:start position:0%
demand on what the price should be right
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
so hospitals do have contacts with their
 
04:44:06.288 --> 04:44:06.298 align:start position:0%
insurers so I am sure the insurers are
 
04:44:09.230 --> 04:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
not signing a contract for a 600 aspirin
 
04:44:11.810 --> 04:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
so I think again there's some language
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
issues here they're um whether they
 
04:44:16.910 --> 04:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
charge for something versus what they
 
04:44:19.070 --> 04:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
actually get paid are very different
 
04:44:19.080 --> 04:44:19.970 align:start position:0%
actually get paid are very different
things

04:44:19.970 --> 04:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:44:23.270 --> 04:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
and guaranteed the insurers pay a lot
 
04:44:23.280 --> 04:44:25.850 align:start position:0%
and guaranteed the insurers pay a lot
less

04:44:25.850 --> 04:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
well I understand that part but I'm just
 
04:44:31.970 --> 04:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
wondering that you know we that being a
 
04:44:34.670 --> 04:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
a preferred Pharmacy provider if I'm
 
04:44:36.708 --> 04:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
reading the words here okay that
 
04:44:40.430 --> 04:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
assuming that that PBM has lined you as
 
04:44:43.070 --> 04:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies have a contract so the
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacies know full well that they're
 
04:44:48.590 --> 04:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
not going to get what they bill for is
 
04:44:50.330 --> 04:44:50.340 align:start position:0%
it true that you're billing on a
 
04:44:52.490 --> 04:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
different billing code to get around
 
04:44:56.570 --> 04:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
this so that you're not paying what it
 
04:44:58.910 --> 04:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
would have been I mean let me put this
 
04:45:01.250 --> 04:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
way the only read brownbacking exists is
 
04:45:03.288 --> 04:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
because it seems to be a hell of a lot
 
04:45:07.850 --> 04:45:07.860 align:start position:0%
cheaper than what you would build
 
04:45:10.270 --> 04:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
so the insurance companies do have
 
04:45:12.890 --> 04:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
contracts with the hospitals and other
 
04:45:14.930 --> 04:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
providers not just hospitals to do
 
04:45:14.940 --> 04:45:16.190 align:start position:0%
providers not just hospitals to do
infusion

04:45:16.190 --> 04:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
infusion
 
04:45:18.650 --> 04:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
it's up to the contract negotiations on
 
04:45:21.050 --> 04:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
what they ultimately will accept for
 
04:45:23.930 --> 04:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
payment with the insurance companies so
 
04:45:25.670 --> 04:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's very well known by the insurance
 
04:45:28.970 --> 04:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
companies what is available for billing
 
04:45:30.708 --> 04:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
and for payments
 
04:45:35.090 --> 04:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
so there shouldn't be any surprises okay
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:41.990 --> 04:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the the handout and
 
04:45:44.390 --> 04:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing that the material on the
 
04:45:47.330 --> 04:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
that's that's printed in Orange compared
 
04:45:49.788 --> 04:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
to the material that's pretty uh
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
presented in green uh appears to at
 
04:45:56.510 --> 04:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
least appears to suggest a more uh
 
04:45:59.628 --> 04:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
complicated or convoluted and lengthier
 
04:45:59.638 --> 04:46:01.128 align:start position:0%
complicated or convoluted and lengthier
process

04:46:01.128 --> 04:46:01.138 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:46:03.770 --> 04:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
the green looks like a more streamlined
 
04:46:03.780 --> 04:46:05.448 align:start position:0%
the green looks like a more streamlined
process

04:46:05.448 --> 04:46:05.458 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:46:08.690 --> 04:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
so if you could uh it's part one address
 
04:46:11.208 --> 04:46:11.218 align:start position:0%
whether that's accurate in terms of the
 
04:46:13.390 --> 04:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
description the presentation and my
 
04:46:15.590 --> 04:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
surmisel of what this means or
 
04:46:15.600 --> 04:46:17.570 align:start position:0%
surmisel of what this means or
conclusion

04:46:17.570 --> 04:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
04:46:20.448 --> 04:46:20.458 align:start position:0%
um but two returning to the issue for a
 
04:46:24.350 --> 04:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
moment of efficacy and consequences
 
04:46:27.170 --> 04:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
for um the drugs that are being white
 
04:46:30.590 --> 04:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
bagged and or or brown bagged
 
04:46:33.770 --> 04:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
um I heard one of you describe that if
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
there is a for example a change in the
 
04:46:39.350 --> 04:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
color uh of the of the medication that
 
04:46:41.868 --> 04:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
does this might suggest that that it's
 
04:46:41.878 --> 04:46:43.128 align:start position:0%
does this might suggest that that it's
efficacy

04:46:43.128 --> 04:46:43.138 align:start position:0%
efficacy
 
04:46:45.530 --> 04:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
um has been compromised in in some way
 
04:46:49.250 --> 04:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
are there other non-observable
 
04:46:52.490 --> 04:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
Signs by which you can determine whether
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
a medication that's been white bagged or
 
04:46:57.890 --> 04:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
brown bag has lost its Effectiveness or
 
04:47:00.590 --> 04:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
acquired deleterious consequences for
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
patients and have there been any
 
04:47:04.730 --> 04:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
instances in which you have been on the
 
04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
receiving end of complaints from
 
04:47:12.110 --> 04:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:14.570 --> 04:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
I'll answer part one regarding the
 
04:47:17.110 --> 04:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
schematic and you are absolutely right
 
04:47:20.690 --> 04:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
that the orange side of the left side of
 
04:47:23.810 --> 04:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
the model is much more convoluted and
 
04:47:26.330 --> 04:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
has several steps in which there could
 
04:47:28.970 --> 04:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
be problems with the medication being
 
04:47:32.090 --> 04:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
compromised not received having to be
 
04:47:33.850 --> 04:47:33.860 align:start position:0%
wasted Etc
 
04:47:36.708 --> 04:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
the green side of the model clearly is
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
if the medications in the hospital or
 
04:47:40.670 --> 04:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
The provider's Possession the entire
 
04:47:44.690 --> 04:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
time then there is very clear way in
 
04:47:46.670 --> 04:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
which that medication is kept safe for
 
04:47:49.550 --> 04:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
the patient and I think I'll ask you to
 
04:47:51.590 --> 04:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
answer the second part so I think your
 
04:47:54.170 --> 04:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
second question was around are there any
 
04:47:56.930 --> 04:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
other ways to identify whether or not a
 
04:47:59.150 --> 04:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
medication one of two and the second was
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
have you ever received any complaints of
 
04:48:04.368 --> 04:48:04.378 align:start position:0%
of deleterious or adverse consequences
 
04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
or non-effectiveness that you could
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
might attribute to Brown bagging a white
 
04:48:10.010 --> 04:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
bag thank you
 
04:48:13.070 --> 04:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
so it's so aside from like looking at
 
04:48:15.770 --> 04:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
deterioration of of a medication or a
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
change in color would be really
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
difficult unless you're going to send
 
04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
the medication for testing to determine
 
04:48:22.250 --> 04:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's any sort of loss
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
of potency which a lot of places we just
 
04:48:27.230 --> 04:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
obviously not able to do that
 
04:48:29.330 --> 04:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
um in terms of have there been any
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
adverse outcomes
 
04:48:33.890 --> 04:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
I think once again a lot of these are
 
04:48:35.150 --> 04:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
being done in the clinic are the
 
04:48:37.970 --> 04:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
infusion spaces and you're looking for
 
04:48:40.190 --> 04:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not there's been a
 
04:48:41.810 --> 04:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
readmission whether or not somebody's
 
04:48:44.510 --> 04:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
ended up in your hospital I think most
 
04:48:48.110 --> 04:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
of the times it's probably due to the um
 
04:48:50.208 --> 04:48:50.218 align:start position:0%
the delay in care it's really hard to
 
04:48:51.530 --> 04:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
say if something would be due to the
 
04:48:54.890 --> 04:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:57.650 --> 04:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
representative spear
 
04:49:00.410 --> 04:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:02.628 --> 04:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
04:49:06.708 --> 04:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
if we're if we are to consider
 
04:49:08.990 --> 04:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh eliminating Brown bagging and white
 
04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
bagging and the idea that the hospital
 
04:49:14.810 --> 04:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
prepares these preparations
 
04:49:16.788 --> 04:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
with all of the
 
04:49:20.270 --> 04:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
places all of the cases that we use
 
04:49:24.650 --> 04:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:27.708 --> 04:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
how are you how on Earth do you mean an
 
04:49:29.810 --> 04:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
inventory like that I mean we're talking
 
04:49:32.170 --> 04:49:32.180 align:start position:0%
about a lot of variations and a lot and
 
04:49:35.030 --> 04:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
yours as a result of them sitting in
 
04:49:38.270 --> 04:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
your hospitals do they kind of
 
04:49:41.090 --> 04:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
deteriorate we have a very significant
 
04:49:43.788 --> 04:49:43.798 align:start position:0%
excuse me a very
 
04:49:43.798 --> 04:49:44.990 align:start position:0%
excuse me a very
um

04:49:44.990 --> 04:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:47.628 --> 04:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
good just-in-time inventory process
 
04:49:50.390 --> 04:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
where for our infusion spaces and our
 
04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
Clinic spaces we can see which patients
 
04:49:53.868 --> 04:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
are coming in and we can order the
 
04:49:56.690 --> 04:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
medications just in time to ensure that
 
04:49:58.430 --> 04:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
they're on hand for the patients when
 
04:50:00.830 --> 04:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
they come in
 
04:50:00.840 --> 04:50:04.788 align:start position:0%
they come in
foreign

04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:08.510 --> 04:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so in when you say
 
04:50:11.930 --> 04:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
that the meds can only be seen you can't
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
really tell and you administer these to
 
04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
folks do you keep any records when
 
04:50:17.760 --> 04:50:18.788 align:start position:0%
folks do you keep any records when
people

04:50:18.788 --> 04:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:50:23.350 --> 04:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
either get sick from it or haven't had
 
04:50:27.530 --> 04:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the drug and I mean where
 
04:50:30.830 --> 04:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
are the statistics on on between the two
 
04:50:32.510 --> 04:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
do you have any
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
so each hospital has
 
04:50:35.280 --> 04:50:37.310 align:start position:0%
so each hospital has
um

04:50:37.310 --> 04:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:37.320 --> 04:50:38.930 align:start position:0%
 
have

04:50:38.930 --> 04:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
reporting mechanisms that would occur
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
these are voluntary reporting mechanisms
 
04:50:47.030 --> 04:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
so we would have to either have the
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
patient come in
 
04:50:50.930 --> 04:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
our emergency department or report it
 
04:50:52.788 --> 04:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
back to their primary care physician
 
04:50:52.798 --> 04:50:54.650 align:start position:0%
back to their primary care physician
that's

04:50:54.650 --> 04:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:50:56.448 --> 04:50:56.458 align:start position:0%
they didn't you know something happened
 
04:50:58.990 --> 04:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
either they had an adverse effect
 
04:51:01.970 --> 04:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
they didn't see the outcome that they
 
04:51:04.128 --> 04:51:04.138 align:start position:0%
would have thought they would have seen
 
04:51:06.350 --> 04:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
and then we would have to ensure that
 
04:51:10.730 --> 04:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
that event was actually recorded
 
04:51:10.740 --> 04:51:12.110 align:start position:0%
that event was actually recorded
um

04:51:12.110 --> 04:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:14.628 --> 04:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
I would say having previously been a
 
04:51:17.150 --> 04:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
medication safety officer at a at a
 
04:51:19.128 --> 04:51:19.138 align:start position:0%
community hospital
 
04:51:19.138 --> 04:51:19.750 align:start position:0%
community hospital
um

04:51:19.750 --> 04:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:23.030 --> 04:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
reporting although we try to increase
 
04:51:25.610 --> 04:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
the reporting we don't get every single
 
04:51:28.010 --> 04:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
report of an adverse event or even a
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.930 --> 04:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
04:51:35.570 --> 04:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
so there's really no way to know what
 
04:51:38.270 --> 04:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
kind of difference there is between the
 
04:51:40.490 --> 04:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
bagging and the non-bagging regardless
 
04:51:42.830 --> 04:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
of the color whether you're in the
 
04:51:45.530 --> 04:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
hospital or you're getting that at home
 
04:51:47.510 --> 04:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
and bringing it to your provider because
 
04:51:49.690 --> 04:51:49.700 align:start position:0%
there's really no
 
04:51:53.750 --> 04:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:57.770 --> 04:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
for us to look at and weigh I mean once
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
again you're looking you're it's
 
04:52:01.730 --> 04:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
voluntary reporting so I'm not going to
 
04:52:03.350 --> 04:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
say that we've never had an adverse
 
04:52:05.090 --> 04:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
outcome at any of our hospitals in the
 
04:52:06.590 --> 04:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I'm sure we have
 
04:52:09.530 --> 04:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
but I would say that it may it we know
 
04:52:12.890 --> 04:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
that quality control we're not sure how
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
patients are storing their medications
 
04:52:18.530 --> 04:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
and we can't guarantee the potency of it
 
04:52:22.550 --> 04:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
we're you know the provider or the nurse
 
04:52:24.350 --> 04:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
in the clinics will look at the
 
04:52:26.810 --> 04:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
medication to to make sure that it looks
 
04:52:30.050 --> 04:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
appropriate but you don't know and so
 
04:52:32.208 --> 04:52:32.218 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
04:52:32.218 --> 04:52:33.470 align:start position:0%
it's really
um

04:52:33.470 --> 04:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:36.170 --> 04:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
I think the biggest things are the
 
04:52:37.910 --> 04:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
timeliness of care
 
04:52:39.890 --> 04:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
along with
 
04:52:41.868 --> 04:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
the you know ensuring that quality
 
04:52:44.448 --> 04:52:44.458 align:start position:0%
control as well one more follow-up on
 
04:52:48.530 --> 04:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
that oh sorry okay so so when the
 
04:52:51.830 --> 04:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
patient is in there and they have they
 
04:52:54.708 --> 04:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
have their labs and it doesn't work out
 
04:52:56.510 --> 04:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
do they stay there the whole time and
 
04:52:58.490 --> 04:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
how long do they wait to get that care
 
04:53:00.590 --> 04:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
as they're making these drugs and do you
 
04:53:02.330 --> 04:53:02.340 align:start position:0%
generally have the drugs on hand so what
 
04:53:03.890 --> 04:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
would happen is that that medication
 
04:53:06.110 --> 04:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
would likely have to be wasted
 
04:53:08.930 --> 04:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
right so that's
 
04:53:11.448 --> 04:53:11.458 align:start position:0%
the met we would have to then buy and
 
04:53:13.430 --> 04:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
Bill right we would then have to use the
 
04:53:15.650 --> 04:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
hospital's medication to treat the
 
04:53:17.690 --> 04:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
patient because the medication that we
 
04:53:20.690 --> 04:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
received they no longer fit the criteria
 
04:53:22.730 --> 04:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
for so
 
04:53:24.948 --> 04:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
um we would throw it away
 
04:53:26.930 --> 04:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
it's that patient's medication we can't
 
04:53:28.430 --> 04:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
do anything with it and have to come
 
04:53:29.628 --> 04:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
back next week
 
04:53:31.970 --> 04:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
I will just add um even though we don't
 
04:53:34.010 --> 04:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
necessarily have statistics
 
04:53:36.170 --> 04:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
um two years ago we had done an
 
04:53:39.170 --> 04:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
extensive study with our hospitals and
 
04:53:40.788 --> 04:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
gathered patient stories and patient
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
experiences specifically our Brown about
 
04:53:45.350 --> 04:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
Brown bagging and white bagging which we
 
04:53:47.628 --> 04:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
could share with the committee great
 
04:53:49.368 --> 04:53:49.378 align:start position:0%
we'll look forward to seeing that in the
 
04:53:51.288 --> 04:53:51.298 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thank you thank you very

of the committee excuse me I'm
 
04:54:52.788 --> 04:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
recovering from having lost my voice
 
04:54:55.368 --> 04:54:55.378 align:start position:0%
yesterday so hopefully it sticks with me
 
04:54:57.050 --> 04:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Heidi Kroll
 
04:55:00.050 --> 04:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
Heidi Kroll I work at Gallagher Callahan
 
04:55:02.090 --> 04:55:02.100 align:start position:0%

04:55:03.540 --> 04:55:05.150 align:start position:0%
ahip which is America's health insurance
plans

04:55:05.150 --> 04:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
plans
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
um we appreciate the opportunity to
 
04:55:06.840 --> 04:55:10.190 align:start position:0%
um we appreciate the opportunity to
testify

04:55:10.190 --> 04:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:12.830 --> 04:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
for reasons that I will explain
 
04:55:15.470 --> 04:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
um ahip feels that the bill is not
 
04:55:18.288 --> 04:55:18.298 align:start position:0%
necessary but
 
04:55:20.750 --> 04:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
with the amendment that the prime
 
04:55:23.690 --> 04:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
sponsor has introduced today we do think
 
04:55:27.170 --> 04:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
in Clarity of the bill and that would I
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
think be acceptable to us the amendment
 
04:55:32.230 --> 04:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
that he has brought in there is still
 
04:55:35.270 --> 04:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
Section 1 Roman 3 in the bill around
 
04:55:38.750 --> 04:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
Brown bagging and um I meant I spoke
 
04:55:41.570 --> 04:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
with a sponsor earlier I think we can
 
04:55:44.990 --> 04:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
work together a little bit to clarify my
 
04:55:46.190 --> 04:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is that he would like it
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
to be an opt out I mean sorry an opt-in
 
04:55:48.480 --> 04:55:49.510 align:start position:0%
to be an opt out I mean sorry an opt-in
provision

04:55:49.510 --> 04:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
provision
 
04:55:52.190 --> 04:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
that would be a patient decision I think
 
04:55:54.350 --> 04:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
we could just tighten up that language
 
04:55:54.360 --> 04:55:56.208 align:start position:0%
we could just tighten up that language
there

04:55:56.208 --> 04:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:55:56.218 --> 04:55:59.448 align:start position:0%
there
um

04:55:59.448 --> 04:55:59.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
so I'll start by saying that ahip
 
04:56:02.690 --> 04:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
strongly believes that everyone should
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
be able to afford uh their prescriptions
 
04:56:08.628 --> 04:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
um to get access to their prescriptions
 
04:56:11.330 --> 04:56:11.340 align:start position:0%
and at a price that they can afford our
 
04:56:13.190 --> 04:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
remarks today are offered to help New
 
04:56:15.410 --> 04:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire achieve that goal
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
the setting of drug prices starts first
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
and foremost with the drug manufacturers
 
04:56:21.650 --> 04:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
however other players in the supply
 
04:56:23.510 --> 04:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
chain contribute to higher drug prices
 
04:56:26.510 --> 04:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
as well the focus of today's bill is on
 
04:56:26.520 --> 04:56:27.590 align:start position:0%
as well the focus of today's bill is on
the

04:56:27.590 --> 04:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:56:29.690 --> 04:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
um frankly outrageous hospital and
 
04:56:31.730 --> 04:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
physician markups on prescription drugs
 
04:56:35.750 --> 04:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
most notably specialty drugs that are
 
04:56:37.610 --> 04:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
administered by providers in a clinical
 
04:56:37.620 --> 04:56:38.750 align:start position:0%
administered by providers in a clinical
setting

04:56:38.750 --> 04:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
setting
 
04:56:41.090 --> 04:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
specialty drugs are the very expensive
 
04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
medications that treat complex chronic
 
04:56:45.170 --> 04:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
or rare conditions such as cancer
 
04:56:47.570 --> 04:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid
 
04:56:50.270 --> 04:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
rheumatoid arthritis physician or
 
04:56:52.010 --> 04:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
Hospital administered specialty drugs
 
04:56:54.590 --> 04:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
are those that cannot be administered by
 
04:56:56.750 --> 04:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
the patient they are typically infused
 
04:56:59.628 --> 04:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
or injected by health care provider in a
 
04:57:01.850 --> 04:57:01.860 align:start position:0%
physician's office a clinic an infusion
 
04:57:04.010 --> 04:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
center or hospital setting
 
04:57:06.410 --> 04:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
specialty drug prices are high and
 
04:57:08.750 --> 04:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
they're growing quickly specialty drugs
 
04:57:10.368 --> 04:57:10.378 align:start position:0%
account for approximately two percent
 
04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
two percent of prescriptions but more
 
04:57:15.530 --> 04:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
than 50 percent of expenditures
 
04:57:17.810 --> 04:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
the price of specialty drugs can range
 
04:57:19.850 --> 04:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
from thousands to tens of thousands of
 
04:57:22.430 --> 04:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
dollars or more per regimen so they're
 
04:57:24.590 --> 04:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
quite expensive prescription drugs are
 
04:57:26.510 --> 04:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
the most significant and fastest growing
 
04:57:28.670 --> 04:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
portion of your health care premium
 
04:57:28.680 --> 04:57:30.708 align:start position:0%
portion of your health care premium
dollar

04:57:30.708 --> 04:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
04:57:33.350 --> 04:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
typically A clinician-administered drugs
 
04:57:35.330 --> 04:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
have been purchased by the provider or
 
04:57:37.730 --> 04:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
the hospital directly from wholesalers
 
04:57:40.208 --> 04:57:40.218 align:start position:0%
the drug cost is then marked up
 
04:57:43.128 --> 04:57:43.138 align:start position:0%
substantially by the provider or the
 
04:57:45.230 --> 04:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
hospital which bills the insurance or
 
04:57:47.628 --> 04:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
the payer like a self-funded employer
 
04:57:50.030 --> 04:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
for the marked up prescription drug and
 
04:57:52.250 --> 04:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
this is referred to as the buy and Bill
 
04:57:52.260 --> 04:57:53.270 align:start position:0%
this is referred to as the buy and Bill
model

04:57:53.270 --> 04:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
model
 
04:57:56.448 --> 04:57:56.458 align:start position:0%
is important to note that provider that
 
04:57:58.610 --> 04:57:58.620 align:start position:0%
the provider or hospital bills
 
04:58:00.830 --> 04:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
separately for administering the drug to
 
04:58:02.570 --> 04:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
the patient so that's including the
 
04:58:05.810 --> 04:58:05.820 align:start position:0%
provider's time and any facility fees so
 
04:58:08.390 --> 04:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
really the the payer the carrier or the
 
04:58:11.030 --> 04:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
self-funded payer gets one bill for the
 
04:58:13.310 --> 04:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
marked up drug price and a separate bill
 
04:58:15.650 --> 04:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
for the provider to administer the drug
 
04:58:17.628 --> 04:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
to the patient
 
04:58:20.208 --> 04:58:20.218 align:start position:0%
the markups on clinician administered
 
04:58:22.788 --> 04:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
drugs are massive process profit centers
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
for providers and hospitals several
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
recent Studies have demonstrated that
 
04:58:29.868 --> 04:58:29.878 align:start position:0%
this buy-in Bill Revenue maker has
 
04:58:32.750 --> 04:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
resulted in average markups of 200 to
 
04:58:35.990 --> 04:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
400 percent Nationwide this is on top of
 
04:58:38.570 --> 04:58:38.580 align:start position:0%
the already very high drug prices set by
 
04:58:40.430 --> 04:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers
 
04:58:42.350 --> 04:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
so these physician markups are well
 
04:58:44.868 --> 04:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
documented and they are significant as I
 
04:58:48.110 --> 04:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned for example a 2018 study by
 
04:58:50.570 --> 04:58:50.580 align:start position:0%
the Moran company found that on average
 
04:58:54.350 --> 04:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals charge 479 percent of their
 
04:58:56.868 --> 04:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
costs for drugs Nationwide the study
 
04:58:59.570 --> 04:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
goes on to report that most hospitals 83
 
04:59:01.910 --> 04:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
percent charge patients and insurers
 
04:59:03.830 --> 04:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
more than double their acquisition cost
 
04:59:05.930 --> 04:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
of the medicine marking up the medicines
 
04:59:07.910 --> 04:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
200 or more
 
04:59:10.730 --> 04:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
the majority of hospitals 53 percent
 
04:59:13.490 --> 04:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
markup medicines between 200 to 400
 
04:59:15.890 --> 04:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
percent on average a small share of
 
04:59:18.288 --> 04:59:18.298 align:start position:0%
hospitals one in six charge seven times
 
04:59:20.690 --> 04:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
the price of the medicine and one out of
 
04:59:22.208 --> 04:59:22.218 align:start position:0%
12 hospitals
 
04:59:25.550 --> 04:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
has an average charge markup greater
 
04:59:27.350 --> 04:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
than a thousand percent
 
04:59:30.050 --> 04:59:30.060 align:start position:0%
so there are other very reputable
 
04:59:33.830 --> 04:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
studies that reach similar findings
 
04:59:35.448 --> 04:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
and more alarming is the finding that
 
04:59:37.390 --> 04:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals to participate in the federal
 
04:59:40.730 --> 04:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
340b program charging on average nearly
 
04:59:43.010 --> 04:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
400 percent of their costs for patients
 
04:59:45.288 --> 04:59:45.298 align:start position:0%
Cancer drugs
 
04:59:48.530 --> 04:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
in January of 2021 article written by Dr
 
04:59:50.930 --> 04:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
Adam fine a nationally recognized expert
 
04:59:52.910 --> 04:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
on pharmaceutical economics and the drug
 
04:59:54.530 --> 04:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
distribution system
 
04:59:56.930 --> 04:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
he looked at payer prices for selected
 
04:59:58.788 --> 04:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
physician administered drugs and he
 
05:00:00.788 --> 05:00:00.798 align:start position:0%
writes that contrary to popular belief
 
05:00:03.770 --> 05:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
hospitals not drug makers keep about 80
 
05:00:06.050 --> 05:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
percent of when insurers pay for these
 
05:00:08.270 --> 05:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
provider administered drugs and after
 
05:00:10.850 --> 05:00:10.860 align:start position:0%
the 340b discounts hospitals keep an
 
05:00:13.368 --> 05:00:13.378 align:start position:0%
even greater share so my point in all of
 
05:00:15.050 --> 05:00:15.060 align:start position:0%
this is that physician administered
 
05:00:18.170 --> 05:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
specialty drugs are a big business for
 
05:00:20.810 --> 05:00:20.820 align:start position:0%
larger Hospital systems National
 
05:00:23.570 --> 05:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
Hospital Pharmacy surveys show that
 
05:00:26.810 --> 05:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
between 2015 and 2019 ownership of a
 
05:00:28.850 --> 05:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
specialty pharmacy by large hospitals
 
05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
increased from 44 percent to 89 percent
 
05:00:35.208 --> 05:00:35.218 align:start position:0%
and again Dr Adam fine described the
 
05:00:37.490 --> 05:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
data showing that nine out of every 10
 
05:00:40.250 --> 05:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
large hospitals own a specialty pharmacy
 
05:00:42.470 --> 05:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
by 2019.
 
05:00:45.708 --> 05:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not immune one of New
 
05:00:48.350 --> 05:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Pharmacy hospitals Pharmacy
 
05:00:50.810 --> 05:00:50.820 align:start position:0%
businesses recently increased Revenue
 
05:00:53.448 --> 05:00:53.458 align:start position:0%
not related to patient medical care for
 
05:00:57.410 --> 05:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 by
 
05:01:00.350 --> 05:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
31.5 million compared to the same
 
05:01:02.990 --> 05:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
three-month period for the prior year so
 
05:01:05.030 --> 05:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
annualize this quarterly increase of
 
05:01:08.470 --> 05:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
31.5 million is more than 120 million
 
05:01:11.090 --> 05:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
year-over-year increase in revenues from
 
05:01:13.788 --> 05:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
the hospital's Pharmacy businesses
 
05:01:15.288 --> 05:01:15.298 align:start position:0%
um and this increase tracks this
 
05:01:17.208 --> 05:01:17.218 align:start position:0%
particular Hospital's last five years of
 
05:01:19.550 --> 05:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
impressive Revenue growth due to its
 
05:01:19.560 --> 05:01:20.690 align:start position:0%
impressive Revenue growth due to its
expansion

05:01:20.690 --> 05:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
05:01:24.110 --> 05:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
of its contract and Specialty Pharmacy
 
05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
the escalating costs of
 
05:01:27.050 --> 05:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
clinician-administered drugs and the
 
05:01:28.250 --> 05:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
growing need for an affordable
 
05:01:31.610 --> 05:01:31.620 align:start position:0%
alternative sparked Market disruption of
 
05:01:33.770 --> 05:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
the traditional buy and Bill model in
 
05:01:35.930 --> 05:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
other words competition entered the
 
05:01:38.208 --> 05:01:38.218 align:start position:0%
picture and ahip fully supports

market-based Solutions
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
so third-party specialty pharmacies that
 
05:01:45.050 --> 05:01:45.060 align:start position:0%
are nationally accredited by the same
 
05:01:47.208 --> 05:01:47.218 align:start position:0%
organizations as the hospital-owned
 
05:01:49.490 --> 05:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
specialty pharmacies have entered the
 
05:01:51.310 --> 05:01:51.320 align:start position:0%
marketplace specifically to deliver
 
05:01:54.350 --> 05:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
medications safely and affordably to
 
05:01:56.030 --> 05:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals and other health care
 
05:01:57.948 --> 05:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
facilities and to help patients and
 
05:02:00.350 --> 05:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
employers actually afford the
 
05:02:02.510 --> 05:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
life-saving medications
 
05:02:04.550 --> 05:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
health insurance companies self-funded
 
05:02:06.830 --> 05:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
plans and government payers are fighting
 
05:02:09.170 --> 05:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
for more affordable drugs by Contracting
 
05:02:10.970 --> 05:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
with third-party specialty pharmacies
 
05:02:13.310 --> 05:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
that meet the same high standards as the
 
05:02:15.230 --> 05:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
hospital pharmacies and supplying
 
05:02:16.970 --> 05:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
patients with the physician administered
 
05:02:19.070 --> 05:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
drugs through white bagging and brown
 
05:02:19.080 --> 05:02:20.390 align:start position:0%
drugs through white bagging and brown
bagging

05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
bagging
 
05:02:24.350 --> 05:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
as you've heard weight bagging is um
 
05:02:26.090 --> 05:02:26.100 align:start position:0%
white bagging and brow bagging where the
 
05:02:28.368 --> 05:02:28.378 align:start position:0%
third party specialty pharmacies ship
 
05:02:30.170 --> 05:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
medicines either directly to the patient
 
05:02:32.390 --> 05:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's brown bagging or to the health
 
05:02:34.448 --> 05:02:34.458 align:start position:0%
care provider that's white bagging
 
05:02:37.490 --> 05:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
developed those practices developed
 
05:02:40.010 --> 05:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
precisely because the hospital-based
 
05:02:42.470 --> 05:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
delivery of these medications has become
 
05:02:45.830 --> 05:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
too expensive
 
05:02:45.840 --> 05:02:46.550 align:start position:0%
too expensive
um

05:02:46.550 --> 05:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:48.708 --> 05:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
hospitals claim that brown bagging and
 
05:02:50.330 --> 05:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
white bagging are unsafe for patients
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
those claims are simply untrue
 
05:02:55.190 --> 05:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
um and frankly they're a red herring
 
05:02:57.470 --> 05:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
Brown bagging and white bagging are safe
 
05:02:59.930 --> 05:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
the real issue is the brown baggy and
 
05:03:02.030 --> 05:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
white bagging offer a cost-effective
 
05:03:03.770 --> 05:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
competitive alternative to the
 
05:03:06.170 --> 05:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
hospital's highly lucrative buy and Bill
 
05:03:08.750 --> 05:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
model and the hospitals frankly don't
 
05:03:09.890 --> 05:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
like that
 
05:03:11.868 --> 05:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
third-party specialty pharmacies or

such forms of dispensing

05:04:28.250 --> 05:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
specialty drugs imposed by the FDA and
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
by the drug manufacturers themselves
 
05:04:33.110 --> 05:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
in addition to the extremely stringent
 
05:04:35.810 --> 05:04:35.820 align:start position:0%
safety requirements health plans always
 
05:04:38.390 --> 05:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
have exception processes in place to
 
05:04:40.550 --> 05:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
address the rare circumstances of
 
05:04:43.550 --> 05:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
quality safety medical necessity and or
 
05:04:45.530 --> 05:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
care Interruption so for example you've
 
05:04:48.288 --> 05:04:48.298 align:start position:0%
heard today that people's care may be
 
05:04:51.470 --> 05:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
delayed that is not true there are
 
05:04:53.448 --> 05:04:53.458 align:start position:0%
exception processes that the carriers
 
05:04:57.350 --> 05:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
have to allow a patient to be taken care
 
05:05:00.230 --> 05:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
of to have their drugs administered when
 
05:05:02.690 --> 05:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
they're there in the in the clinical
 
05:05:02.700 --> 05:05:04.550 align:start position:0%
they're there in the in the clinical
setting

05:05:04.550 --> 05:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
setting
 
05:05:06.410 --> 05:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
Health Plans develop their Specialty
 
05:05:08.330 --> 05:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy programs with all potential
 
05:05:09.890 --> 05:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
dosing and treatment dispensing
 
05:05:12.230 --> 05:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
scenarios in mind in fact medications
 
05:05:13.788 --> 05:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
are routinely shipped with enough
 
05:05:16.368 --> 05:05:16.378 align:start position:0%
additional Supply so that facilities can
 
05:05:18.830 --> 05:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
adjust a dose as required at the time of
 
05:05:18.840 --> 05:05:20.990 align:start position:0%
adjust a dose as required at the time of
administration

05:05:20.990 --> 05:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
administration
 
05:05:23.150 --> 05:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
the processes for delivering medications
 
05:05:25.250 --> 05:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
through specialty pharmacies are the
 
05:05:27.170 --> 05:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
same as those used when hospitals
 
05:05:29.690 --> 05:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
acquire the drugs themselves in fact
 
05:05:31.368 --> 05:05:31.378 align:start position:0%
many hospitals and physician groups
 
05:05:33.530 --> 05:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
obtain their medications from the same
 
05:05:35.570 --> 05:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
specialty pharmacies and they use the
 
05:05:37.490 --> 05:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
same delivery companies and procedures
 
05:05:39.650 --> 05:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
to serve their patients
 
05:05:41.750 --> 05:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
for example if you were to go to the
 
05:05:44.090 --> 05:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
webpage for Dartmouth Hitchcock's
 
05:05:45.890 --> 05:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
Specialty Pharmacy prescription Services
 
05:05:48.708 --> 05:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
you will see that it states your
 
05:05:50.868 --> 05:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
refrigerated medications will be shipped
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
overnight at no charge via FedEx
 
05:05:56.090 --> 05:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
all non-refrigerated medications are
 
05:05:59.270 --> 05:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
shipped via USPS or FedEx should there
 
05:06:01.850 --> 05:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
be a delay you will be notified to
 
05:06:03.890 --> 05:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
prevent interruptions and therapy please
 
05:06:05.390 --> 05:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
call the Dartmouth Hitchcock Pharmacy
 
05:06:07.250 --> 05:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
within one business day to report
 
05:06:10.368 --> 05:06:10.378 align:start position:0%
missing or damaged contents so you know
 
05:06:12.288 --> 05:06:12.298 align:start position:0%
they're dealing basically with the exact
 
05:06:15.288 --> 05:06:15.298 align:start position:0%
same systems that specialty pharmacies
 
05:06:16.490 --> 05:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
are dealing with
 
05:06:19.010 --> 05:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
one final point to keep in mind is that
 
05:06:20.628 --> 05:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire appears to be
 
05:06:22.368 --> 05:06:22.378 align:start position:0%
using brown bagging and white bagging
 
05:06:24.530 --> 05:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
presumably to save its employees and
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money if you go to the
 
05:06:27.948 --> 05:06:27.958 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
05:06:29.690 --> 05:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
website and pull up their active
 
05:06:31.190 --> 05:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
employee prescription drug benefit
 
05:06:33.410 --> 05:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
program you will see under their
 
05:06:35.750 --> 05:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
specialty medications that all specialty
 
05:06:37.610 --> 05:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
medications are provided by a third
 
05:06:40.788 --> 05:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
party Specialty Pharmacy
 
05:06:40.798 --> 05:06:41.330 align:start position:0%
party Specialty Pharmacy
um

05:06:41.330 --> 05:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:45.288 --> 05:06:45.298 align:start position:0%
so in some we do not support placing any
 
05:06:47.868 --> 05:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
bans or restrictions around Brown
 
05:06:51.288 --> 05:06:51.298 align:start position:0%
bagging or white bagging the effect if
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
you were to do that would one to would
 
05:06:56.330 --> 05:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
be to eliminate a critical market-based
 
05:06:58.430 --> 05:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
tool to lowering the cost of physician
 
05:07:00.230 --> 05:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
administered drugs and the second
 
05:07:02.868 --> 05:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
frankly would be if you were to place a
 
05:07:04.490 --> 05:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
complete ban on everything would be to
 
05:07:07.550 --> 05:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
Grant essentially a statutory Monopoly
 
05:07:09.590 --> 05:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
on the supply of physician administered
 
05:07:11.690 --> 05:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
drugs to the hospital-owned pharmacies
 
05:07:13.850 --> 05:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
and you know the result would be nothing
 
05:07:15.410 --> 05:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
short of
 
05:07:18.590 --> 05:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh unfettered um price hikes for granite
 
05:07:21.890 --> 05:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
Staters so again we do uh having just
 
05:07:23.990 --> 05:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment today but
 
05:07:25.190 --> 05:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
um it appears to us that we could
 
05:07:26.390 --> 05:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
support the amendment that the prime
 
05:07:28.730 --> 05:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
sponsor has brought in and we will work
 
05:07:32.208 --> 05:07:32.218 align:start position:0%
with him um on the uh clarifying the
 
05:07:35.270 --> 05:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
opt-in on the brown bagging
 
05:07:38.690 --> 05:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you so before I take questions
 
05:07:40.788 --> 05:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
going back to that phrase in the
 
05:07:42.948 --> 05:07:42.958 align:start position:0%
amendment that I'm looking at the
 
05:07:46.910 --> 05:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
pair preferred Pharmacy provider so you
 
05:07:49.070 --> 05:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
don't have this now in your contracts
 
05:07:51.890 --> 05:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
with these pharmacies with the hospitals
 
05:07:55.250 --> 05:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
so so not all carriers are using brown
 
05:07:56.990 --> 05:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
bagging and white bagging some are just
 
05:07:58.430 --> 05:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
doing the best well I'm talking about
 
05:08:00.590 --> 05:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursement right when there's winds
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
being concocted inside the pharmacy so I
 
05:08:05.150 --> 05:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
think the the way that language would
 
05:08:07.670 --> 05:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
work under as I understand the amendment
 
05:08:07.680 --> 05:08:09.350 align:start position:0%
work under as I understand the amendment
that

05:08:09.350 --> 05:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:08:12.350 --> 05:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
um any Hospital could pull off their
 
05:08:15.350 --> 05:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
shelf what they would like to use to
 
05:08:18.650 --> 05:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
administer to the patient and uh the way
 
05:08:20.868 --> 05:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
the language reads the reimbursement
 
05:08:23.390 --> 05:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
rate is kind of the any willing provider
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
that we have in the pharmacy anyway so
 
05:08:29.690 --> 05:08:29.700 align:start position:0%
that that price that the why haven't you
 
05:08:32.570 --> 05:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
fixed that in your contracts
 
05:08:34.850 --> 05:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
why haven't you why isn't why doesn't
 
05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
the insurance company have in their
 
05:08:40.368 --> 05:08:40.378 align:start position:0%
contracts this map or whatever we had
 
05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
with any willing provider Pharmacy bill
 
05:08:45.230 --> 05:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
that whatever that minimum manufacturer
 
05:08:48.410 --> 05:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
that price why why aren't you holding
 
05:08:49.850 --> 05:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
the hospitals and saying too bad you
 
05:08:50.990 --> 05:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
want for
 
05:08:53.090 --> 05:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
you know you're you can't get that much
 
05:08:54.830 --> 05:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know this is what we have in our
 
05:08:58.250 --> 05:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
formulary and I think it's a great
 
05:09:00.708 --> 05:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
question I think the folks at the
 
05:09:06.250 --> 05:09:06.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:08.570 --> 05:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
that's that's my head scratcher here I
 
05:09:10.368 --> 05:09:10.378 align:start position:0%
mean why why is this problem here at all
 
05:09:12.530 --> 05:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
I mean doing that you know all we hear
 
05:09:14.208 --> 05:09:14.218 align:start position:0%
is insurance companies you know we'll
 
05:09:17.090 --> 05:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
pay what they feel like it yeah that's
 
05:09:19.550 --> 05:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
why how can you be held you know hostage
 
05:09:23.030 --> 05:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
by a hospital Unless somehow you they
 
05:09:24.770 --> 05:09:24.780 align:start position:0%
because you have to have them in your
 
05:09:28.310 --> 05:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
network then they get to say no you
 
05:09:29.868 --> 05:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
can't have that clause in this contract
 
05:09:31.368 --> 05:09:31.378 align:start position:0%
well I think I think that's what I'm
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
afraid of yeah I think that um the
 
05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
option having the option the tool in the
 
05:09:37.550 --> 05:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
toolbox if you will
 
05:09:39.770 --> 05:09:39.780 align:start position:0%
um to have white bagging and brow
 
05:09:42.590 --> 05:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
bagging available does lend some
 
05:09:42.600 --> 05:09:44.150 align:start position:0%
bagging available does lend some
negotiating

05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
negotiating
 
05:09:46.490 --> 05:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
um leverage I guess you know versus
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
having you that we'd say that that they
 
05:09:51.470 --> 05:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
have to put this in the contract that
 
05:09:53.448 --> 05:09:53.458 align:start position:0%
they have to take the same price that
 
05:09:55.010 --> 05:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
anybody else would have to take whether
 
05:09:57.830 --> 05:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
your preferred Pharmacy is manufacturing
 
05:09:59.628 --> 05:09:59.638 align:start position:0%
right so this competitive alternative
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
allows I think that in the negotiation
 
05:10:04.810 --> 05:10:04.820 align:start position:0%
process okay now representative Herbert
 
05:10:06.530 --> 05:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
my answer
 
05:10:10.610 --> 05:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
um so my question was you mentioned an
 
05:10:13.070 --> 05:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
amendment or an area of agreement you
 
05:10:17.090 --> 05:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
may be able to come to with the sponsor
 
05:10:20.150 --> 05:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
and you didn't explain the details at
 
05:10:22.070 --> 05:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
that time but it sounds to me like you
 
05:10:25.430 --> 05:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
just did I so uh I am known to cut to
 
05:10:29.230 --> 05:10:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:32.470 --> 05:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
and not everywhere
 
05:10:35.410 --> 05:10:35.420 align:start position:0%
so so
 
05:10:38.810 --> 05:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
anyway I think
 
05:10:41.090 --> 05:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that you found the answer John
 
05:10:42.970 --> 05:10:42.980 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
05:10:45.530 --> 05:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative gifts thank you Mr
 
05:10:48.110 --> 05:10:48.120 align:start position:0%

works every day to try to keep our
 
05:11:11.690 --> 05:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
premiums uh health insurance affordable
 
05:11:13.550 --> 05:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
okay everybody else oh yeah
 
05:11:15.708 --> 05:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
representative purcelli a clarification
 
05:11:19.310 --> 05:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
one more time so I understand the safety
 
05:11:21.050 --> 05:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
concerns which are separate but I'm
 
05:11:23.208 --> 05:11:23.218 align:start position:0%
talking I'm uh concerned about the
 
05:11:25.610 --> 05:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
affordability or the billing so I think
 
05:11:28.910 --> 05:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
what we're suggesting is that instead of
 
05:11:32.208 --> 05:11:32.218 align:start position:0%
saying we're segregating these specialty
 
05:11:34.490 --> 05:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
drugs so the hospitals
 
05:11:38.208 --> 05:11:38.218 align:start position:0%
can figure out what their pricing is
 
05:11:41.030 --> 05:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
that they must use the standard pricing
 
05:11:43.550 --> 05:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's out in the marketplace is that
 
05:11:45.410 --> 05:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
those well we learned it in other builds
 
05:11:47.448 --> 05:11:47.458 align:start position:0%
there's there's their their minimum
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
pricing you know right and uh so why
 
05:11:52.670 --> 05:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it apply to this why doesn't it
 
05:11:55.750 --> 05:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
play here yeah right okay
 
05:11:58.550 --> 05:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
and to be clear
 
05:12:00.650 --> 05:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
um we didn't see the necessity for the
 
05:12:00.660 --> 05:12:01.850 align:start position:0%
um we didn't see the necessity for the
bill

05:12:01.850 --> 05:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:12:03.948 --> 05:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
um so but you know we're we're happy if
 
05:12:05.448 --> 05:12:05.458 align:start position:0%
there is no bill
 
05:12:07.730 --> 05:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
um but if there is a bill we support the
 
05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
amendment and then right but we like to
 
05:12:12.470 --> 05:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
lower health insurance costs so we do
 
05:12:12.480 --> 05:12:14.230 align:start position:0%
lower health insurance costs so we do
too

05:12:14.230 --> 05:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
too
 
05:12:17.330 --> 05:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
okay a quick follow-up would be
 
05:12:19.550 --> 05:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
um so is there an amendment to say that
 
05:12:22.610 --> 05:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
we're not going to outright ban the
 
05:12:25.190 --> 05:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
brown or white bagging but it could be a
 
05:12:26.990 --> 05:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
option well we have to kind of sort
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
through the sub in the subcommittee what
 
05:12:31.430 --> 05:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
this language in front of us does
 
05:12:32.990 --> 05:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
yes it is
 
05:12:35.030 --> 05:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
right my understanding is that this the
 
05:12:36.410 --> 05:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill has submitted
 
05:12:38.448 --> 05:12:38.458 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the committee
 
05:12:40.970 --> 05:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
um and I spoke with him prior
 
05:12:42.948 --> 05:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
um that there might be some additional
 
05:12:45.650 --> 05:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
clarification around opting into the
 
05:12:47.750 --> 05:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
brown bagging exactly but again our
 
05:12:49.850 --> 05:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
position first and foremost is that we
 
05:12:51.288 --> 05:12:51.298 align:start position:0%
don't think the bill is thank you very
 
05:12:51.298 --> 05:12:53.750 align:start position:0%
don't think the bill is thank you very
much

05:12:53.750 --> 05:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:56.510 --> 05:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
um I I the insurance department put in a
 
05:12:59.150 --> 05:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
card here and I'm dying to hear what you
 
05:13:03.350 --> 05:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
have to say but I I know that uh Sabrina
 
05:13:05.570 --> 05:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
you know also had a card in sooner but
 
05:13:07.910 --> 05:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure she'll feel like her testimony
 
05:13:10.490 --> 05:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
has been well spoken already but I'll
 
05:13:13.010 --> 05:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
let you I'll just
 
05:13:15.170 --> 05:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
let them go ahead here
 
05:13:16.610 --> 05:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
05:13:18.410 --> 05:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to uh to
 
05:13:19.788 --> 05:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
testify today I hoped that I wouldn't
 
05:13:21.288 --> 05:13:21.298 align:start position:0%
have to I'll be completely candid when
 
05:13:22.670 --> 05:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative Magoo offered me this
 
05:13:24.650 --> 05:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
bill I said we don't need it and then
 
05:13:26.150 --> 05:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
when he showed me the amendment today I
 
05:13:30.050 --> 05:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
said it was a masterful way to weave in
 
05:13:33.770 --> 05:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh some some kind of uh positive uh
 
05:13:35.750 --> 05:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
Improvement in the white bagging Brown
 
05:13:37.670 --> 05:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
bagging discussion
 
05:13:39.948 --> 05:13:39.958 align:start position:0%
um so what happened I think it's hard to
 
05:13:42.230 --> 05:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
compete with uh with what uh Heidi Kroll
 
05:13:44.570 --> 05:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
just said in large part Alex and I can
 
05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
talk to how this works ultimately what
 
05:13:50.868 --> 05:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
we want is providers and carriers to
 
05:13:52.368 --> 05:13:52.378 align:start position:0%
negotiate how they're going to handle
 
05:13:54.590 --> 05:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
the billing of these Services of these
 
05:13:56.330 --> 05:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
specialty pharmacies how they're going
 
05:13:58.550 --> 05:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
to deliver them who's going to cure them
 
05:14:01.310 --> 05:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
who's going to keep them in the fridge
 
05:14:04.550 --> 05:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
um what what allows that to happen what
 
05:14:05.868 --> 05:14:05.878 align:start position:0%
allows those parties to come to the
 
05:14:07.430 --> 05:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
table with equal bargaining power or
 
05:14:10.550 --> 05:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
somewhat equal bargaining power is the
 
05:14:12.050 --> 05:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
possibility that white bag no Brown
 
05:14:14.628 --> 05:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
bagging is an alternative our fear is
 
05:14:16.670 --> 05:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
that if if it in a situation where white
 
05:14:17.930 --> 05:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
bag and brown bag was taken off the
 
05:14:20.750 --> 05:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
table you would upset the scales of
 
05:14:22.610 --> 05:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
bargaining power
 
05:14:24.830 --> 05:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
um for the part of this bill that
 
05:14:26.470 --> 05:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
addresses things that they have not
 
05:14:29.750 --> 05:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
contracted to and so this is some I
 
05:14:32.030 --> 05:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
presume some very specialty formula
 
05:14:34.910 --> 05:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
medication that was disrupted in transit
 
05:14:38.570 --> 05:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
that there is a uh agreed upon fair
 
05:14:41.390 --> 05:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
market value map for that is wonderful
 
05:14:42.948 --> 05:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't something we had
 
05:14:45.230 --> 05:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
considered before ultimately the party
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
should negotiate that and they are
 
05:14:48.770 --> 05:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
sophisticated and can do that and so
 
05:14:51.070 --> 05:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
though we don't take positions on stuff
 
05:14:54.410 --> 05:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
amendment 432h is masterful for what
 
05:14:56.570 --> 05:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
it's trying to do
 
05:14:58.990 --> 05:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
is that ditto Alex
 
05:15:02.868 --> 05:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
you know and um I wanted to mention that
 
05:15:06.230 --> 05:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh when we did the fiscal know uh for
 
05:15:08.330 --> 05:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
this bill we expressed concerns that it
 
05:15:11.170 --> 05:15:11.180 align:start position:0%
might escalate uh health insurance costs
 
05:15:14.570 --> 05:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
and uh we feel very differently about
 
05:15:15.948 --> 05:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
05:15:15.958 --> 05:15:17.330 align:start position:0%
the amendment
perfect

05:15:17.330 --> 05:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
05:15:20.330 --> 05:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
great thank you guys okay one card left
 
05:15:22.430 --> 05:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
oh represent representative we almost
 
05:15:24.010 --> 05:15:24.020 align:start position:0%
made it
 
05:15:27.170 --> 05:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the fiscal notes so the
 
05:15:29.208 --> 05:15:29.218 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes with the amendment no
 
05:15:31.010 --> 05:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
longer apply is that what you're saying
 
05:15:38.330 --> 05:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:40.610 --> 05:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
State action to add a health benefit
 
05:15:43.250 --> 05:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
which is above or in addition to the
 
05:15:45.350 --> 05:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
essential health benefits all that does
 
05:15:47.330 --> 05:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
that all that comes up it all goes away
 
05:15:49.310 --> 05:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you all right Sabrina
 
05:15:51.360 --> 05:15:52.670 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you all right Sabrina

05:15:57.310 --> 05:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
figured so
 
05:15:59.990 --> 05:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay with that I will close the public
 
05:16:03.830 --> 05:16:03.840 align:start position:0%

05:16:15.170 --> 05:16:15.180 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
05:16:45.650 --> 05:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
of the committee talk about one having
 
05:16:48.170 --> 05:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the other
 
05:16:50.930 --> 05:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
here's my send my pink card up on that
 
05:16:53.208 --> 05:16:53.218 align:start position:0%
other than they had the same sponsor
 
05:16:53.218 --> 05:16:54.650 align:start position:0%
other than they had the same sponsor
yes

05:16:54.650 --> 05:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:16:56.090 --> 05:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
that's why they're scheduled this way
 
05:16:57.770 --> 05:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
exactly and I really appreciate that
 
05:16:59.990 --> 05:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
courtesy I really do
 
05:17:02.448 --> 05:17:02.458 align:start position:0%
and because Taylor wanted me to move it
 
05:17:06.430 --> 05:17:06.440 align:start position:0%
off too so he has himself to blame
 
05:17:09.170 --> 05:17:09.180 align:start position:0%
yes I was traveling out of the out of
 
05:17:10.690 --> 05:17:10.700 align:start position:0%
the country
 
05:17:14.030 --> 05:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
so I do I really do appreciate that
 
05:17:16.788 --> 05:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
um so this one's a hopefully quite a bit
 
05:17:19.310 --> 05:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
simpler it is really good to see you
 
05:17:21.708 --> 05:17:21.718 align:start position:0%
again yeah famous last words really good
 
05:17:23.090 --> 05:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
to see you again uh twice in one day
 
05:17:26.270 --> 05:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
really a privilege um there were copies
 
05:17:27.830 --> 05:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
of an amendment that went around on this
 
05:17:29.208 --> 05:17:29.218 align:start position:0%
one too
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
um it was not an all after the enacting
 
05:17:36.708 --> 05:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
Clause uh it's zero five zero nine h
 
05:17:40.430 --> 05:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
on this one and it replaced section one
 
05:17:44.150 --> 05:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill I have some copies here is
 
05:17:46.850 --> 05:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
anybody how many copies do you have well
 
05:17:49.850 --> 05:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
I delivered 20 before lunch so you
 
05:17:51.590 --> 05:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
should all have I have one here yeah so
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
there's some extras I'll leave them up
 
05:17:54.050 --> 05:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
here at the table for anybody else who's
 
05:17:56.208 --> 05:17:56.218 align:start position:0%
testifying in case you didn't get them
 
05:17:57.890 --> 05:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
anyways hopefully it's pretty quick um
 
05:17:59.510 --> 05:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'll hand off some to some experts
 
05:18:00.890 --> 05:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
behind me after a really quick personal
 
05:18:00.900 --> 05:18:02.868 align:start position:0%
behind me after a really quick personal
story

05:18:02.868 --> 05:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
story
 
05:18:02.878 --> 05:18:03.530 align:start position:0%
story
um

05:18:03.530 --> 05:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 304 is a good consumer
 
05:18:08.628 --> 05:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
protection Bill designed to inform
 
05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
consumers about some potentially bad
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
practices that you really could not
 
05:18:16.670 --> 05:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
possibly know about or at least would be
 
05:18:19.250 --> 05:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
very unlikely to know about
 
05:18:19.260 --> 05:18:19.850 align:start position:0%
very unlikely to know about
um

05:18:19.850 --> 05:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
related to windshield repairs uh maybe
 
05:18:26.628 --> 05:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
one of the simpler car repairs
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
that everybody runs into especially this
 
05:18:30.650 --> 05:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
time of year you're driving down the
 
05:18:33.350 --> 05:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
road you get a windshield chip I had one
 
05:18:37.128 --> 05:18:37.138 align:start position:0%
uh maybe just barely over a year ago and
 
05:18:41.150 --> 05:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
I had no idea until I went in to it was
 
05:18:42.770 --> 05:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
about inspection time I went in for an
 
05:18:46.070 --> 05:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
oil change in my good faithful dealer
 
05:18:48.230 --> 05:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
that I've used for years State Motors in
 
05:18:50.510 --> 05:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester the one by the Puritan back
 
05:18:50.520 --> 05:18:51.470 align:start position:0%
Manchester the one by the Puritan back
room

05:18:51.470 --> 05:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
room
 
05:18:55.010 --> 05:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh my dealer my service manager John
 
05:18:56.810 --> 05:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
said do you know you have a big chip and
 
05:18:58.430 --> 05:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
I said no I don't see any chips and he
 
05:18:59.868 --> 05:18:59.878 align:start position:0%
goes well it's hidden by the a-pillar
 
05:19:01.850 --> 05:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
you know the glass extends over
 
05:19:03.050 --> 05:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
and he said well you can't get it
 
05:19:05.628 --> 05:19:05.638 align:start position:0%
inspected and it's not not urgent but
 
05:19:08.208 --> 05:19:08.218 align:start position:0%
it's going to spread to a big crack and
 
05:19:10.010 --> 05:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
you have a very expensive windshield
 
05:19:12.530 --> 05:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
because of your heads up display and all
 
05:19:14.270 --> 05:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
the sensors and blah blah blah you're
 
05:19:16.490 --> 05:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
gonna have to get it recalibrated
 
05:19:18.230 --> 05:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
and I said well I'm not too worried
 
05:19:20.330 --> 05:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
about it because
 
05:19:23.868 --> 05:19:23.878 align:start position:0%
I have a comprehensive insurance and I
 
05:19:25.850 --> 05:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
don't think I have a deductible on it so
 
05:19:28.730 --> 05:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
I'll call Geico so I called Geico and
 
05:19:31.270 --> 05:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
they said no problem uh zero deductible
 
05:19:33.890 --> 05:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
schedule an appointment but you have to
 
05:19:36.350 --> 05:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
go to the dealer I said well it's a good
 
05:19:38.030 --> 05:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
thing I've already gone to the dealer
 
05:19:41.090 --> 05:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
and State Motors should handle it
 
05:19:44.150 --> 05:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
and I called them back and they said you
 
05:19:46.550 --> 05:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
know checks in the mail uh they said
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
great let us know when it gets there
 
05:19:50.330 --> 05:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very expensive and so I
 
05:19:51.288 --> 05:19:51.298 align:start position:0%
said whatever I ignored them and they
 
05:19:52.910 --> 05:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
said but it has to be done by a
 
05:19:55.730 --> 05:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
specialized place
 
05:19:57.470 --> 05:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
um anyway so I called state orders back
 
05:19:58.970 --> 05:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
I said send me a loaner car blah blah
 
05:20:00.830 --> 05:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
blah you get the idea this is should not
 
05:20:02.510 --> 05:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
be a big deal I essentially ignored
 
05:20:05.090 --> 05:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
everything the rep uh at the other end
 
05:20:06.708 --> 05:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
of the Geico
 
05:20:08.990 --> 05:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
phone call said when they read me this
 
05:20:12.010 --> 05:20:12.020 align:start position:0%
very long script I completely ignored it
 
05:20:14.510 --> 05:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
because it's a windshield repair and
 
05:20:16.010 --> 05:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
everybody has these done in New England
 
05:20:19.310 --> 05:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
if you drive behind a you know DPW truck
 
05:20:22.430 --> 05:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
and you have chip anyways
 
05:20:24.530 --> 05:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
um they said you know something about
 
05:20:26.570 --> 05:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
recalibration I kind of vaguely remember
 
05:20:29.990 --> 05:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
it so I brought the my car in
 
05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
as a truck it's an SUV
 
05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
um I brought the car in and they I came
 
05:20:39.730 --> 05:20:39.740 align:start position:0%
back and I couldn't see the navigation
 
05:20:42.708 --> 05:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
anymore I couldn't read the top of the
 
05:20:44.090 --> 05:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
map and you know I have one of those
 
05:20:46.190 --> 05:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
things that projects the speed and the
 
05:20:49.368 --> 05:20:49.378 align:start position:0%
map and I couldn't read it anymore and
 
05:20:50.990 --> 05:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not that tall I'm six feet
 
05:20:53.810 --> 05:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
tall and I had the guy get in he said oh
 
05:20:55.850 --> 05:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
I can't read it either and they said
 
05:20:57.470 --> 05:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
okay we'll give you another low car try
 
05:20:57.480 --> 05:20:58.910 align:start position:0%
okay we'll give you another low car try
again

05:20:58.910 --> 05:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:20:58.920 --> 05:20:59.628 align:start position:0%
again
um

05:20:59.628 --> 05:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:03.050 --> 05:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
this went on for like several weeks next
 
05:21:04.910 --> 05:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
thing I know they're taking the dash off
 
05:21:07.010 --> 05:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
and they're replacing the heads up
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
display and it's three thousand dollars
 
05:21:10.610 --> 05:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
and it's four thousand dollars and
 
05:21:12.170 --> 05:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
thankfully all of this is covered but
 
05:21:14.390 --> 05:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
they should have to sign the bill every
 
05:21:14.400 --> 05:21:15.410 align:start position:0%
they should have to sign the bill every
time

05:21:15.410 --> 05:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
anyways the long and the short of it is
 
05:21:20.930 --> 05:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
it's a very specialized process
 
05:21:25.310 --> 05:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
um and they thankfully were using either
 
05:21:28.670 --> 05:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
safe flight or Portland or one of the
 
05:21:30.650 --> 05:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
big name places and bringing in a
 
05:21:34.690 --> 05:21:34.700 align:start position:0%
specialized person to do this but had I
 
05:21:38.208 --> 05:21:38.218 align:start position:0%
listened carefully or not listened
 
05:21:39.708 --> 05:21:39.718 align:start position:0%
carefully or I didn't have the right
 
05:21:42.470 --> 05:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
dealer I may never have known this and I
 
05:21:45.288 --> 05:21:45.298 align:start position:0%
could have been in a very expensive
 
05:21:45.298 --> 05:21:46.730 align:start position:0%
could have been in a very expensive
process

05:21:46.730 --> 05:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:21:50.990 --> 05:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
so when one of the uh folks behind me
 
05:21:54.470 --> 05:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
that I met 20 some years ago on this
 
05:21:56.868 --> 05:21:56.878 align:start position:0%
committee called me shortly after I got
 
05:21:59.330 --> 05:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
elected and said I have a consumer
 
05:22:00.830 --> 05:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
protection bill and I need someone to
 
05:22:02.570 --> 05:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
sponsor it I said if I got a story for
 
05:22:05.810 --> 05:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
you I just went through this and it very
 
05:22:07.730 --> 05:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
easily could have cost me out of pocket
 
05:22:10.250 --> 05:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of money taking the dash
 
05:22:11.868 --> 05:22:11.878 align:start position:0%
off replacing the HUD et cetera et
 
05:22:13.250 --> 05:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
cetera Etc
 
05:22:16.310 --> 05:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
so I was reluctant to put in a piece of
 
05:22:18.110 --> 05:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that might affect the small
 
05:22:20.330 --> 05:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
business guy because I don't believe in
 
05:22:22.128 --> 05:22:22.138 align:start position:0%
unnecessary bills and unnecessary
 
05:22:22.138 --> 05:22:23.390 align:start position:0%
unnecessary bills and unnecessary
legislation

05:22:23.390 --> 05:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:22:25.850 --> 05:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
so I went to the guy whose son I coached
 
05:22:27.770 --> 05:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
in football who's owned the local towing
 
05:22:29.330 --> 05:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
shop and then I went to the guy that
 
05:22:31.490 --> 05:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
changes my oil on a regular basis and I
 
05:22:32.868 --> 05:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
went to two or three other repair shops
 
05:22:34.190 --> 05:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
and I said what about your Auto Glass
 
05:22:36.050 --> 05:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
business is this going to put you out of
 
05:22:37.368 --> 05:22:37.378 align:start position:0%
business this is probably a lucrative
 
05:22:37.378 --> 05:22:38.448 align:start position:0%
business this is probably a lucrative
thing

05:22:38.448 --> 05:22:38.458 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:22:40.610 --> 05:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
and I checked around and they all said
 
05:22:43.368 --> 05:22:43.378 align:start position:0%
we don't do it we call safe flight
 
05:22:47.810 --> 05:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
Portland and we all sub it out and we're
 
05:22:50.150 --> 05:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
not worried about it and we tell our
 
05:22:52.850 --> 05:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
customers our regular customers
 
05:22:55.610 --> 05:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
you know leave your car here we'll bring
 
05:22:58.010 --> 05:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
in the experts we get a you know we get
 
05:23:00.708 --> 05:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
a little referral fee and we you know we
 
05:23:03.230 --> 05:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
have our guys and and that's what they
 
05:23:06.110 --> 05:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
do and you should we have no problem
 
05:23:08.570 --> 05:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
with you putting in this kind of bill
 
05:23:11.750 --> 05:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
because all it does is require us to
 
05:23:15.110 --> 05:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
notify and protect the consumer
 
05:23:17.868 --> 05:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to leave the rest of the
 
05:23:19.550 --> 05:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
technicalities I understand there was a
 
05:23:21.110 --> 05:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
bill in before that was elaborate
 
05:23:22.250 --> 05:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
there's other states that have done
 
05:23:24.708 --> 05:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
other things a number of other states
 
05:23:27.470 --> 05:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
that have enacted complicated pieces of
 
05:23:30.288 --> 05:23:30.298 align:start position:0%
legislation and this is simple and this
 
05:23:33.708 --> 05:23:33.718 align:start position:0%
is direct and it requires some simple
 
05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
consumer protection notification
 
05:23:35.160 --> 05:23:36.128 align:start position:0%
consumer protection notification
language

05:23:36.128 --> 05:23:36.138 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:23:39.470 --> 05:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy we've gone through some
 
05:23:41.868 --> 05:23:41.878 align:start position:0%
iterations of the uh the language and
 
05:23:46.128 --> 05:23:46.138 align:start position:0%
how it is a notification piece and
 
05:23:48.050 --> 05:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
um I think it's good language they think
 
05:23:50.090 --> 05:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
it's good language there's some
 
05:23:52.010 --> 05:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
interested parties that'll tell you some
 
05:23:53.930 --> 05:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
facts and figures on you know how many
 
05:23:56.208 --> 05:23:56.218 align:start position:0%
millions of windshields are replaced and
 
05:23:58.190 --> 05:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
why it's complicated but that's my
 
05:24:00.110 --> 05:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
personal story and how it came I came to
 
05:24:02.208 --> 05:24:02.218 align:start position:0%
be prime sponsor on this and it's what
 
05:24:03.350 --> 05:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
really happened to me and it literally
 
05:24:04.788 --> 05:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
could have been six grand I mean I
 
05:24:06.650 --> 05:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
signed the invoices for it so
 
05:24:08.690 --> 05:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
that's the story about the eight ass
 
05:24:10.490 --> 05:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
bill so what's the problem we're trying
 
05:24:12.650 --> 05:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
to fix here the problem is
 
05:24:15.650 --> 05:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
um an unsuspecting consumer could very
 
05:24:18.470 --> 05:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
easily go to a fly-by-night auto glass
 
05:24:22.090 --> 05:24:22.100 align:start position:0%
shop not be told leave and have
 
05:24:25.010 --> 05:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
non-working Collision sensors radar
 
05:24:26.990 --> 05:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
sensors laser sensors all the sensors
 
05:24:29.208 --> 05:24:29.218 align:start position:0%
that are in your complicated windshield
 
05:24:32.690 --> 05:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
get a get a aftermarket or an average
 
05:24:35.208 --> 05:24:35.218 align:start position:0%
windshield glass replacement and all of
 
05:24:36.770 --> 05:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
those important sensors Collision
 
05:24:39.010 --> 05:24:39.020 align:start position:0%
sensors braking sensors all those things
 
05:24:41.448 --> 05:24:41.458 align:start position:0%
be completely uncalibrated and never
 
05:24:44.690 --> 05:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
know it this bill simply says you need
 
05:24:48.170 --> 05:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
to go get those recalibrated once you
 
05:24:50.690 --> 05:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
leave here we can do your glass but you
 
05:24:53.050 --> 05:24:53.060 align:start position:0%
we can't calibrate your system
 
05:24:55.128 --> 05:24:55.138 align:start position:0%
recalibrate your system right so this
 
05:24:57.110 --> 05:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
requires notification of that of that so
 
05:24:58.368 --> 05:24:58.378 align:start position:0%
the consumer
 
05:25:02.330 --> 05:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
who doesn't know anything about all this
 
05:25:04.970 --> 05:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
calibration stuff comes in and and
 
05:25:06.708 --> 05:25:06.718 align:start position:0%
somebody is going to sell them a glass
 
05:25:09.230 --> 05:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
knowing full well that they can't do the
 
05:25:11.270 --> 05:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
calibration but they actually can't do
 
05:25:13.850 --> 05:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
the proper Services correct so once that
 
05:25:15.530 --> 05:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
person gets in the car and starts
 
05:25:18.410 --> 05:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
driving away they're going to see that
 
05:25:20.930 --> 05:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
eventually let's say maybe they don't
 
05:25:22.430 --> 05:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
see it right away because they're busy
 
05:25:24.170 --> 05:25:24.180 align:start position:0%
thinking something else but at some
 
05:25:25.310 --> 05:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
point in time they're going to realize
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
right away that it doesn't work
 
05:25:29.810 --> 05:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
what is wrong with our Consumer
 
05:25:31.550 --> 05:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
Protection Law now
 
05:25:34.368 --> 05:25:34.378 align:start position:0%
for them to go back to that dealer and
 
05:25:35.810 --> 05:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
have him say
 
05:25:39.190 --> 05:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
oh gee I'm so sorry I I screwed up
 
05:25:41.510 --> 05:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
here's your money back they should be
 
05:25:43.190 --> 05:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
told before Mr chairman they should be I
 
05:25:44.868 --> 05:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
mean that's a valid question they should
 
05:25:47.208 --> 05:25:47.218 align:start position:0%
they should be told up front we can't do
 
05:25:50.150 --> 05:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
that we can't do that work and here's
 
05:25:52.910 --> 05:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
where you can go get that work done
 
05:25:54.410 --> 05:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
and they should be they should be told
 
05:25:55.550 --> 05:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
up front
 
05:25:57.230 --> 05:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
that we can't do we can't do that work
 
05:25:59.470 --> 05:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
and you've got all of these safety
 
05:26:03.110 --> 05:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
sensors in your car that need to be
 
05:26:05.330 --> 05:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
addressed I mean Geico was good enough
 
05:26:06.410 --> 05:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
to me
 
05:26:08.390 --> 05:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
not everybody has Geico or Progressive
 
05:26:08.400 --> 05:26:10.208 align:start position:0%
not everybody has Geico or Progressive
okay

05:26:10.208 --> 05:26:10.218 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:26:12.350 --> 05:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
some of the other guys that are in this
 
05:26:14.330 --> 05:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
business for a living
 
05:26:16.430 --> 05:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
so under the consumer protection the
 
05:26:16.440 --> 05:26:17.930 align:start position:0%
so under the consumer protection the
penalties

05:26:17.930 --> 05:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
05:26:21.410 --> 05:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
if they want us if the guy assuming says
 
05:26:23.150 --> 05:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
too bad
 
05:26:25.910 --> 05:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
or or if the guy says here's your money
 
05:26:27.890 --> 05:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
back I mean you're just saying sure
 
05:26:30.770 --> 05:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
Caveat Emptor we cannot we cannot I mean
 
05:26:32.390 --> 05:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of even the consumer protection
 
05:26:36.230 --> 05:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
act can't say to uh somebody that as
 
05:26:37.550 --> 05:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
long as they give them person the money
 
05:26:39.350 --> 05:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
back and say whatever their charge is
 
05:26:42.170 --> 05:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
you know going back and and and and and
 
05:26:44.770 --> 05:26:44.780 align:start position:0%
that means refunding
 
05:26:47.090 --> 05:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
but that under the consumer protection
 
05:26:49.250 --> 05:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
that's all that's the extent of what the
 
05:26:50.570 --> 05:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
ACT will do now that's all the
 
05:26:53.750 --> 05:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
requirements yeah so what you're saying
 
05:26:55.910 --> 05:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
is they have to tell them up front yeah
 
05:26:58.250 --> 05:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
but if they don't what happens
 
05:27:00.590 --> 05:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
single production kicks in they'd have
 
05:27:02.090 --> 05:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
to they have to the only recourse they
 
05:27:03.830 --> 05:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
would have would be the current consumer
 
05:27:05.990 --> 05:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
protection act so I guess they think
 
05:27:08.150 --> 05:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's bad I I'm just trying to figure
 
05:27:10.670 --> 05:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
out what the purpose of the law the
 
05:27:12.230 --> 05:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
purpose of the purpose of the law is to
 
05:27:14.628 --> 05:27:14.638 align:start position:0%
notify him up front that they need to
 
05:27:19.788 --> 05:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:23.208 --> 05:27:23.218 align:start position:0%
no okay okay okay I mean you could
 
05:27:24.830 --> 05:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
definitely take the position as this
 
05:27:26.510 --> 05:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
committee has some number of times that
 
05:27:27.708 --> 05:27:27.718 align:start position:0%
it's buyer beware and you can't
 
05:27:30.050 --> 05:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
legislate common sense but I'm saying
 
05:27:32.750 --> 05:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
that most windshield and I think I think
 
05:27:34.730 --> 05:27:34.740 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear from some witnesses
 
05:27:37.750 --> 05:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
behind me that after
 
05:27:41.150 --> 05:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
2023 certain point in 2023 that all
 
05:27:42.770 --> 05:27:42.780 align:start position:0%
windshields are going to need
 
05:27:45.410 --> 05:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
some kind of recalibration and I don't
 
05:27:46.850 --> 05:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
remember the exact date and the
 
05:27:49.490 --> 05:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
specifics on that for collisions I'm all
 
05:27:52.550 --> 05:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
set okay yes okay
 
05:27:55.390 --> 05:27:55.400 align:start position:0%
The Usual Suspects
 
05:27:57.890 --> 05:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer some real technical
 
05:27:57.900 --> 05:28:01.448 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer some real technical
questions

05:28:01.448 --> 05:28:01.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:03.410 --> 05:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to go reverse order
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Terry first so thank you
 
05:28:09.890 --> 05:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
so does your bill have in view actual
 
05:28:13.030 --> 05:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
instances of unscrupulous shall we say
 
05:28:16.628 --> 05:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
uh repair shop deals who do this work
 
05:28:19.310 --> 05:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
knowing that they can't do what they
 
05:28:21.770 --> 05:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
have to do so that I'm sorry to get into
 
05:28:25.190 --> 05:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
this situation where afterwards as
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative hunt described
 
05:28:31.490 --> 05:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
um somebody has to resort to a and after
 
05:28:36.490 --> 05:28:36.500 align:start position:0%
the fact or after the the uh uh the the
 
05:28:39.830 --> 05:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
damages have been done so to speak uh
 
05:28:42.830 --> 05:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
process you're trying to preempt all of
 
05:28:45.410 --> 05:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
this with your bill saying that you have
 
05:28:47.990 --> 05:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
to notify people in advance and I'm
 
05:28:50.090 --> 05:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
saying is this really necessary because
 
05:28:52.970 --> 05:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
you have actual instances where this has
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
happened to people do I can I provide
 
05:28:57.830 --> 05:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
you with actual instances where it's
 
05:29:00.708 --> 05:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
happening or data you just no we're
 
05:29:03.650 --> 05:29:03.660 align:start position:0%
sanitary I I don't have and I'm sure the
 
05:29:05.810 --> 05:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
folks behind me do because they're in in
 
05:29:08.448 --> 05:29:08.458 align:start position:0%
the business in the industry so I I
 
05:29:11.030 --> 05:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
honestly don't have
 
05:29:15.170 --> 05:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
um statistics on how often uh
 
05:29:17.930 --> 05:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
currently fly by night
 
05:29:20.930 --> 05:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
um repair shops victimize consumers for
 
05:29:22.610 --> 05:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
Auto Glass so I don't have that data so
 
05:29:24.170 --> 05:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
This falls into the category of you
 
05:29:26.570 --> 05:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
think this is a good idea
 
05:29:28.910 --> 05:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
just occurs to you as a good idea as a
 
05:29:31.128 --> 05:29:31.138 align:start position:0%
common sense good idea you don't have
 
05:29:34.190 --> 05:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
instances where we have problems that
 
05:29:37.250 --> 05:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
you are seeking to do so no I wouldn't I
 
05:29:39.830 --> 05:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say that it falls onto Falls
 
05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
onto you know representative's good idea
 
05:29:45.590 --> 05:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to solve a problem we
 
05:29:46.910 --> 05:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
05:29:48.708 --> 05:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
um it it's like it falls into the
 
05:29:51.590 --> 05:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
category of Common Sense consumer
 
05:29:53.330 --> 05:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
protection that a number of other states
 
05:29:54.890 --> 05:29:54.900 align:start position:0%
have addressed and that we're going to
 
05:29:57.050 --> 05:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
need to address because all windshields
 
05:29:59.330 --> 05:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
have this it's a common common sense
 
05:30:01.490 --> 05:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
consumer protection idea and I will tell
 
05:30:04.670 --> 05:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
you that there are uh vastly more
 
05:30:07.970 --> 05:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
qualified experts in this industry that
 
05:30:10.250 --> 05:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
can speak to the uh the legislation that
 
05:30:11.868 --> 05:30:11.878 align:start position:0%
some other state and they have the
 
05:30:13.788 --> 05:30:13.798 align:start position:0%
statistics on it that I just simply
 
05:30:14.628 --> 05:30:14.638 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
05:30:17.030 --> 05:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
so they'll speak to it
 
05:30:19.730 --> 05:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
okay representing Gibbs
 
05:30:23.330 --> 05:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman is there in your
 
05:30:26.208 --> 05:30:26.218 align:start position:0%
understanding a safety issue that makes
 
05:30:29.628 --> 05:30:29.638 align:start position:0%
it important that the consumer received
 
05:30:32.208 --> 05:30:32.218 align:start position:0%
this information up front about the need
 
05:30:33.770 --> 05:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
for recalibration
 
05:30:35.330 --> 05:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gibbs for your
 
05:30:38.208 --> 05:30:38.218 align:start position:0%
question I think there's about 30 safety
 
05:30:41.170 --> 05:30:41.180 align:start position:0%
issues in the various sensors speed
 
05:30:45.410 --> 05:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
braking uh Collision sensors that make
 
05:30:47.990 --> 05:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
it that issue that I would like all
 
05:30:51.230 --> 05:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
those drivers to be aware of so that
 
05:30:53.510 --> 05:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
they're properly recalibrated uh
 
05:30:55.610 --> 05:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up inquiry for the question you
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
may inquire thank you uh so this isn't
 
05:31:01.490 --> 05:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
just something that seems to you to be a
 
05:31:03.650 --> 05:31:03.660 align:start position:0%
common sense good idea but rather
 
05:31:07.430 --> 05:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
something that is necessary for safety
 
05:31:10.010 --> 05:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gibbs I I'd like the
 
05:31:13.070 --> 05:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
driver behind me who's uh texting and I
 
05:31:13.080 --> 05:31:14.090 align:start position:0%
driver behind me who's uh texting and I
I

05:31:14.090 --> 05:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:31:17.208 --> 05:31:17.218 align:start position:0%
um or you know drinking their coffee for
 
05:31:19.128 --> 05:31:19.138 align:start position:0%
their windshield sensors to be working
 
05:31:19.138 --> 05:31:20.628 align:start position:0%
their windshield sensors to be working
properly

05:31:20.628 --> 05:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
properly
 
05:31:20.638 --> 05:31:21.530 align:start position:0%
properly
um

05:31:21.530 --> 05:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:23.110 --> 05:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
for sure yeah
 
05:31:25.730 --> 05:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
representative spear
 
05:31:28.368 --> 05:31:28.378 align:start position:0%
the manual for my car very specifically
 
05:31:30.470 --> 05:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
and I've read my manual front to cover
 
05:31:32.570 --> 05:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
and back to cover
 
05:31:35.990 --> 05:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
and it says whatever the words are and
 
05:31:37.788 --> 05:31:37.798 align:start position:0%
it says very specifically if you remove
 
05:31:39.708 --> 05:31:39.718 align:start position:0%
the windshield make sure you get it
 
05:31:41.510 --> 05:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
calibrated It also says if you remove
 
05:31:42.948 --> 05:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
the battery you got to get something
 
05:31:44.990 --> 05:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
calibrated It also says if you change
 
05:31:47.030 --> 05:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
the tires you got to get the sensors
 
05:31:49.910 --> 05:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
recalibrated I have a list from that
 
05:31:53.448 --> 05:31:53.458 align:start position:0%
manual what car goes out without a
 
05:31:55.368 --> 05:31:55.378 align:start position:0%
manual without something in the manual
 
05:31:57.490 --> 05:31:57.500 align:start position:0%
it tells you to do this
 
05:32:00.288 --> 05:32:00.298 align:start position:0%
I would uh guess that you're probably in
 
05:32:02.510 --> 05:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
the minority uh of folks that read the
 
05:32:03.530 --> 05:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
manual about their windshield
 
05:32:05.750 --> 05:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
calibration I know that I didn't read it
 
05:32:07.970 --> 05:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
until after when I was trying to
 
05:32:12.708 --> 05:32:12.718 align:start position:0%
diagnose this ridiculous HUD problem but
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
I did find it you're correct mine also
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
said get the windshield calibrated um
 
05:32:19.010 --> 05:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
but I didn't know that until it was far
 
05:32:20.810 --> 05:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
too late
 
05:32:26.410 --> 05:32:26.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:28.670 --> 05:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
I had pee on my head a quick question
 
05:32:32.990 --> 05:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
with the disclosure I'm sorry I couldn't
 
05:32:35.750 --> 05:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
find it in the bed so um you want
 
05:32:38.448 --> 05:32:38.458 align:start position:0%
disclosure so what what is it that
 
05:32:40.368 --> 05:32:40.378 align:start position:0%
you're looking for when you sign the
 
05:32:41.868 --> 05:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
little piece of paper there's a
 
05:32:44.510 --> 05:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph that no one reads that says by
 
05:32:46.730 --> 05:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
the way you have to recalibrate I'm just
 
05:32:48.230 --> 05:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
trying to get to the
 
05:32:52.128 --> 05:32:52.138 align:start position:0%
purpose or the remedy of the bill
 
05:32:55.430 --> 05:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know you they did tell you but you
 
05:32:56.628 --> 05:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
didn't listen
 
05:33:00.650 --> 05:33:00.660 align:start position:0%
okay so what is it that you're trying to
 
05:33:06.708 --> 05:33:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:09.650 --> 05:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question uh simply
 
05:33:12.590 --> 05:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
put I'd like like the Bill calls for a
 
05:33:15.288 --> 05:33:15.298 align:start position:0%
notification of the consumer that the uh
 
05:33:17.990 --> 05:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
yeah but how is that how writing he's
 
05:33:19.850 --> 05:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
asking she's asking you they did notify
 
05:33:22.368 --> 05:33:22.378 align:start position:0%
you just didn't pay attention
 
05:33:24.110 --> 05:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
well I mean I suppose that's possible
 
05:33:26.570 --> 05:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
with any similar notification that the
 
05:33:32.650 --> 05:33:32.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:35.868 --> 05:33:35.878 align:start position:0%
I want to know specifically what it is
 
05:33:39.288 --> 05:33:39.298 align:start position:0%
what is the notification process so you
 
05:33:41.930 --> 05:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
have I don't know it verbally doesn't
 
05:33:44.510 --> 05:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
work it doesn't know either because he
 
05:33:46.730 --> 05:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
didn't listen he didn't listen to it so
 
05:33:48.650 --> 05:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
he has no idea what he installed right
 
05:33:50.448 --> 05:33:50.458 align:start position:0%
so that's not going to solve the problem
 
05:33:53.208 --> 05:33:53.218 align:start position:0%
if you have you know the when I get my
 
05:33:55.190 --> 05:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
oil changed I have to sign the little
 
05:33:57.050 --> 05:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
contract that I don't read the small
 
05:34:00.470 --> 05:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
print so that probably won't work how
 
05:34:02.628 --> 05:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
are we going to make sure that cons and
 
05:34:04.730 --> 05:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
reading the manual probably won't work
 
05:34:07.128 --> 05:34:07.138 align:start position:0%
so how are we going to educate uh
 
05:34:09.890 --> 05:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
consumers to say oh by the way a simple
 
05:34:12.590 --> 05:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
nothing is simple anymore so when you
 
05:34:14.690 --> 05:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
want to get the little ding replaced in
 
05:34:18.050 --> 05:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
your Auto Glass it becomes a pro it
 
05:34:20.030 --> 05:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
becomes you know an event
 
05:34:23.510 --> 05:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
vent well so so the bill calls for a
 
05:34:24.890 --> 05:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
notification in writing or
 
05:34:27.830 --> 05:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
electronically so that leaves it up to
 
05:34:30.230 --> 05:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
the repair shop to either provide them
 
05:34:32.628 --> 05:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
some sort of a written disclosure or
 
05:34:34.448 --> 05:34:34.458 align:start position:0%
electronic disclosure
 
05:34:38.270 --> 05:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
I mean that does leave it open uh but it
 
05:34:40.310 --> 05:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
does have to be in writing I mean they
 
05:34:43.788 --> 05:34:43.798 align:start position:0%
can email it to them or provide them a
 
05:34:45.708 --> 05:34:45.718 align:start position:0%
standard form I mean I don't I don't
 
05:34:47.448 --> 05:34:47.458 align:start position:0%
think we need to be much more specific
 
05:34:49.788 --> 05:34:49.798 align:start position:0%
than that but but it does make it so
 
05:34:52.970 --> 05:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
it's not verbal so and it has to be that
 
05:34:55.010 --> 05:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
the recalibration was not successful or
 
05:34:56.690 --> 05:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
was not performed
 
05:34:58.610 --> 05:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
and that the vehicle needs to be taken
 
05:35:00.230 --> 05:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
to a manufacturer certified dealership
 
05:35:02.690 --> 05:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
you can read the you see in the text of
 
05:35:03.590 --> 05:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:35:06.590 --> 05:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
s okay you guys you've already had your
 
05:35:06.600 --> 05:35:10.868 align:start position:0%
s okay you guys you've already had your
questions

05:35:10.868 --> 05:35:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:14.330 --> 05:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
so as luck would have it
 
05:35:14.340 --> 05:35:15.650 align:start position:0%
so as luck would have it
uh

05:35:15.650 --> 05:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:35:18.948 --> 05:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
this goes to the what's the problem
 
05:35:22.430 --> 05:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
we I've had I have fancy modern cars
 
05:35:25.310 --> 05:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
with these fancy modern windshields
 
05:35:28.190 --> 05:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
and I've I have a son that seems to use
 
05:35:30.110 --> 05:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
them to catch rocks
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh so I've had four windshields replaced
 
05:35:36.530 --> 05:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
on two cars in the last nine months
 
05:35:39.368 --> 05:35:39.378 align:start position:0%
so and I don't know what sort of
 
05:35:42.288 --> 05:35:42.298 align:start position:0%
requiring tattoos on the people at safe
 
05:35:44.330 --> 05:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
flight you could possibly ask for
 
05:35:47.150 --> 05:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
because the insurance company tells me
 
05:35:50.270 --> 05:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
that you need to have it recalibrated I
 
05:35:51.708 --> 05:35:51.718 align:start position:0%
suppose there's something in the manual
 
05:35:58.390 --> 05:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:00.770 --> 05:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
when you take it into the safe white
 
05:36:02.690 --> 05:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
place they say well you know it has to
 
05:36:03.948 --> 05:36:03.958 align:start position:0%
be warm enough so that we can
 
05:36:06.650 --> 05:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
recalibrate it you go oh okay fine and
 
05:36:07.970 --> 05:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
then you go back and pick it up the next
 
05:36:09.288 --> 05:36:09.298 align:start position:0%
day and they said all right we
 
05:36:10.788 --> 05:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
recalibrated it and do you have any
 
05:36:13.190 --> 05:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
questions no I've got no questions so
 
05:36:15.770 --> 05:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
maybe it's safe flight is super duper
 
05:36:17.390 --> 05:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
good about this and other people aren't
 
05:36:21.530 --> 05:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
but if you're not a major glass shop you
 
05:36:23.990 --> 05:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
can't even do one of these windshields
 
05:36:25.868 --> 05:36:25.878 align:start position:0%
I mean you know
 
05:36:28.430 --> 05:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
would you believe would you believe I
 
05:36:32.448 --> 05:36:32.458 align:start position:0%
mean I have I have a 1930 Packard and on
 
05:36:34.788 --> 05:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
that it says you the spark you
 
05:36:36.708 --> 05:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
pull out the throttle the choke halfway
 
05:36:38.868 --> 05:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
give it a yank and it starts I mean
 
05:36:40.670 --> 05:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's the owner's manual a much simpler
 
05:36:43.128 --> 05:36:43.138 align:start position:0%
project but you can replace the glass on
 
05:36:46.010 --> 05:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
that you can't replace that on the
 
05:36:47.830 --> 05:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
on the Cadillac
 
05:36:50.390 --> 05:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative facts and I would believe
 
05:36:52.730 --> 05:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
that yeah and and thank you for your
 
05:36:55.190 --> 05:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
question and that's exactly precisely
 
05:36:57.410 --> 05:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
why you need this bill because not
 
05:36:59.270 --> 05:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
everyone is safe flight although safe
 
05:37:01.010 --> 05:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
flight and safe flight is here
 
05:37:03.350 --> 05:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
and safely is going to tell you
 
05:37:06.590 --> 05:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
with much more degree of expertise than
 
05:37:08.150 --> 05:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
I can
 
05:37:10.550 --> 05:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and I and I hope so I I'd like to
 
05:37:12.830 --> 05:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony and respect the
 
05:37:15.230 --> 05:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
committee's afternoon times allow the
 
05:37:17.930 --> 05:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
experts to elaborate the member is
 
05:37:21.350 --> 05:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to no longer take I mean I'll be
 
05:37:23.240 --> 05:37:23.250 align:start position:0%
happy to take no don't take anymore
 
05:37:23.250 --> 05:37:38.350 align:start position:0%
happy to take no don't take anymore
[Laughter]

05:37:38.350 --> 05:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:40.788 --> 05:37:40.798 align:start position:0%
this is a would you believe so you all
 
05:37:42.830 --> 05:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
you have to do is say yes or no all
 
05:37:46.250 --> 05:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
right would you believe that you have
 
05:37:49.270 --> 05:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
provided me with yet another opportunity
 
05:37:53.448 --> 05:37:53.458 align:start position:0%
to justify to my wife why I am going to
 
05:37:57.110 --> 05:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
keep my 2000 Camry and not buy a new
 
05:38:00.070 --> 05:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle okay yes or no would you believe
 
05:38:02.208 --> 05:38:02.218 align:start position:0%
yes I would and that's an excellent
 
05:38:04.970 --> 05:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and and would you
 
05:38:07.128 --> 05:38:07.138 align:start position:0%
believe I
 
05:38:10.730 --> 05:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
went through this 30 years ago
 
05:38:14.090 --> 05:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
when they used to put the antenna yes in
 
05:38:15.530 --> 05:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
the glass yes
 
05:38:15.540 --> 05:38:17.208 align:start position:0%
the glass yes
and

05:38:17.208 --> 05:38:17.218 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:38:20.270 --> 05:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
and had to be told by the guy who was
 
05:38:23.150 --> 05:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
selling my glass to go out and look at
 
05:38:25.850 --> 05:38:25.860 align:start position:0%
that windshield and do you have that and
 
05:38:27.230 --> 05:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
I didn't even know I didn't even think
 
05:38:28.910 --> 05:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
twice about you know that's true I never
 
05:38:31.250 --> 05:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
really did see the antenna okay so this
 
05:38:34.970 --> 05:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
is a very old story yep so thank you
 
05:38:37.190 --> 05:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Mr chairman always a
 
05:38:38.810 --> 05:38:38.820 align:start position:0%

05:39:03.530 --> 05:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman honorable members of this
 
05:39:06.470 --> 05:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Scott Zike and I
 
05:39:08.208 --> 05:39:08.218 align:start position:0%
work for Safe Light group based out of
 
05:39:10.128 --> 05:39:10.138 align:start position:0%
Columbus Ohio there's 20 people on this
 
05:39:11.930 --> 05:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
island safe flight is the leading
 
05:39:13.610 --> 05:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
provider of vehicle glass repair
 
05:39:16.730 --> 05:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
replacement and Adas recalibration
 
05:39:19.190 --> 05:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
services in the country we operate in
 
05:39:21.110 --> 05:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
all 50 States including here in New
 
05:39:21.120 --> 05:39:22.010 align:start position:0%
all 50 States including here in New
Hampshire

05:39:22.010 --> 05:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:39:24.170 --> 05:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
I'll cut really to the chase to try to
 
05:39:25.550 --> 05:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
answer some of your questions we would
 
05:39:27.288 --> 05:39:27.298 align:start position:0%
appreciate that yeah
 
05:39:31.010 --> 05:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
this is this is about safety and because
 
05:39:33.890 --> 05:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
your forward-facing camera
 
05:39:36.708 --> 05:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
dictates automatic braking Lane
 
05:39:39.650 --> 05:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
deviation if that camera's off by a
 
05:39:41.930 --> 05:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
millimeter that could cause the vehicle
 
05:39:45.530 --> 05:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
to go 50 feet left 30 feet long on
 
05:39:47.868 --> 05:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
braking so it's critical
 
05:39:50.868 --> 05:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
that if you take your car and under New
 
05:39:52.910 --> 05:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law consumers have a right to
 
05:39:54.708 --> 05:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
take their car anywhere they want to
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
take it to get it repaired this bill
 
05:39:59.810 --> 05:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't change that but if you go to a
 
05:40:01.010 --> 05:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
glass shop
 
05:40:03.470 --> 05:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
and that glass shop should be informing
 
05:40:05.990 --> 05:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
you that you have an Adas feature that
 
05:40:08.510 --> 05:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be recalibrated if they can do
 
05:40:11.448 --> 05:40:11.458 align:start position:0%
it if they can't they need to push you
 
05:40:13.850 --> 05:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
in the direction of a quality not just
 
05:40:14.930 --> 05:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
safe light there's a lot of glass
 
05:40:16.910 --> 05:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
companies that can do it
 
05:40:19.070 --> 05:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
you know our business model has changed
 
05:40:21.288 --> 05:40:21.298 align:start position:0%
because everyone's accustomed to a
 
05:40:24.350 --> 05:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
one-hour job and we come to you
 
05:40:26.208 --> 05:40:26.218 align:start position:0%
we have to change that because we cannot
 
05:40:28.730 --> 05:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
recalibrate outside of a flat surface
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
protected area
 
05:40:33.708 --> 05:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
so again if it's not done appropriately
 
05:40:35.628 --> 05:40:35.638 align:start position:0%
you're still responsible as a consumer
 
05:40:36.890 --> 05:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
to drive your car
 
05:40:38.990 --> 05:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
you know you can't solely rely on the
 
05:40:41.448 --> 05:40:41.458 align:start position:0%
safety features but they're designed to
 
05:40:43.250 --> 05:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
create the safety zone around your car
 
05:40:45.770 --> 05:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
and if that camera is not recalibrated
 
05:40:47.150 --> 05:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
you're in danger
 
05:40:48.948 --> 05:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
so you should at least be told whether
 
05:40:51.050 --> 05:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
you have it up front you should be told
 
05:40:53.030 --> 05:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
if the glass shop can do it doesn't
 
05:40:54.470 --> 05:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
matter if they can or can't but they
 
05:40:56.448 --> 05:40:56.458 align:start position:0%
should inform you if they have done it
 
05:40:58.850 --> 05:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
or if they can't do it if they did it
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
was it successful
 
05:41:03.170 --> 05:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
if someone brought up fraud
 
05:41:05.690 --> 05:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
I can get you the data because there are
 
05:41:07.490 --> 05:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
glass shops that are out there charging
 
05:41:09.650 --> 05:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
for recalibrations and they're not doing
 
05:41:09.660 --> 05:41:10.430 align:start position:0%
for recalibrations and they're not doing
it

05:41:10.430 --> 05:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:41:13.970 --> 05:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
so they need a recourse first is just to
 
05:41:17.868 --> 05:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
be informed second is give them an give
 
05:41:19.190 --> 05:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
them a way to have it
 
05:41:21.050 --> 05:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
to get a recourse from the Attorney
 
05:41:22.670 --> 05:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
General's office under the consumer
 
05:41:25.430 --> 05:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
protection act and that's our goal
 
05:41:27.350 --> 05:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is very similar to one that
 
05:41:30.470 --> 05:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
was passed in Maryland Arizona we're
 
05:41:32.930 --> 05:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
going to see it hopefully here we're
 
05:41:34.368 --> 05:41:34.378 align:start position:0%
going to see it in Florida Texas
 
05:41:37.610 --> 05:41:37.620 align:start position:0%
Illinois Nevada and probably Hawaii this
 
05:41:39.890 --> 05:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
year and it really is about consumer
 
05:41:42.650 --> 05:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
protection that's all it's about it's
 
05:41:44.690 --> 05:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
not about driving people to one shop or
 
05:41:46.850 --> 05:41:46.860 align:start position:0%
another we just think it's important as
 
05:41:48.470 --> 05:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
a leading advocate for Consumer
 
05:41:48.480 --> 05:41:49.670 align:start position:0%
a leading advocate for Consumer
Protection

05:41:49.670 --> 05:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
Protection
 
05:41:52.970 --> 05:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
that you be informed up front to a lot
 
05:41:54.830 --> 05:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
of people
 
05:41:56.868 --> 05:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
I've never read my manual
 
05:42:00.110 --> 05:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
and you should be if you call a glass
 
05:42:02.270 --> 05:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
shop they should just tell you
 
05:42:04.250 --> 05:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
by the make and model of your car that
 
05:42:06.050 --> 05:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
you have the safety feature that needs
 
05:42:08.330 --> 05:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
to be recalibrated whether they can do
 
05:42:09.830 --> 05:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
it it's still your choice to take
 
05:42:12.530 --> 05:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
wherever you want it to go but they need
 
05:42:13.610 --> 05:42:13.620 align:start position:0%
to inform you whether it was done
 
05:42:17.208 --> 05:42:17.218 align:start position:0%
successfully and not Bill anybody you as
 
05:42:18.948 --> 05:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
a consumer or insurance company for
 
05:42:21.410 --> 05:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
services that are not rendered so that's
 
05:42:23.810 --> 05:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
the real purpose it is really safety and
 
05:42:25.310 --> 05:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
consumer protection
 
05:42:27.830 --> 05:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
and customer satisfaction because the
 
05:42:31.010 --> 05:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
model has changed when you you're we
 
05:42:33.770 --> 05:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
used to we'll come to you in your 2000
 
05:42:33.780 --> 05:42:34.850 align:start position:0%
used to we'll come to you in your 2000
Camry

05:42:34.850 --> 05:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
Camry
 
05:42:36.368 --> 05:42:36.378 align:start position:0%
but if you have a
 
05:42:40.190 --> 05:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
2022 Camry you have to come to us
 
05:42:42.110 --> 05:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
and it and it's a very complicated
 
05:42:44.510 --> 05:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
process there's a handout if any of you
 
05:42:46.970 --> 05:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
would like to see a calibration done
 
05:42:49.850 --> 05:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
come to a shop near you we'll show you
 
05:42:51.530 --> 05:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
how it's done
 
05:42:53.810 --> 05:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
um it's it's fascinating because if you
 
05:42:55.490 --> 05:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
read the handout
 
05:42:58.730 --> 05:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
every vehicle manufacturer has different
 
05:42:58.740 --> 05:42:59.510 align:start position:0%
every vehicle manufacturer has different
um

05:42:59.510 --> 05:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:03.410 --> 05:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
mandates or expectations specifications
 
05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
some is once called a static where you
 
05:43:08.270 --> 05:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
plug into the car's brain
 
05:43:10.970 --> 05:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
and you read it to say it's done right
 
05:43:13.430 --> 05:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
and it says it's done right others say
 
05:43:14.990 --> 05:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
just get in the car and drive at 50
 
05:43:17.208 --> 05:43:17.218 align:start position:0%
miles an hour for five minutes some
 
05:43:18.470 --> 05:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
require both
 
05:43:22.310 --> 05:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
and the reason why it's important that
 
05:43:25.430 --> 05:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
we pass this bill is there are incidents
 
05:43:27.890 --> 05:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
of fraud there's incidents of crashes
 
05:43:30.650 --> 05:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
and safety and I would just ask for your
 
05:43:30.660 --> 05:43:31.490 align:start position:0%
and safety and I would just ask for your
support

05:43:31.490 --> 05:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:43:34.850 --> 05:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
we support it if we have to make further
 
05:43:37.128 --> 05:43:37.138 align:start position:0%
amendments we're open to that I can get
 
05:43:39.890 --> 05:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
the data safety data fraud data for you
 
05:43:41.930 --> 05:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
all if you take this the subcommittee or
 
05:43:44.208 --> 05:43:44.218 align:start position:0%
wherever it goes but I would ask you for
 
05:43:45.948 --> 05:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
your support and I'm open to take any
 
05:43:47.948 --> 05:43:47.958 align:start position:0%
questions you might have
 
05:43:49.970 --> 05:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs
 
05:43:51.830 --> 05:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you just a quick question when you
 
05:43:53.390 --> 05:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
buy the car
 
05:43:56.090 --> 05:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the dealer tell you about the
 
05:43:57.410 --> 05:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
fee you know when they're selling you
 
05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
the car they tell you what the features
 
05:44:02.090 --> 05:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
are and so if it's a it's a I don't know
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
what to call it a smart window
 
05:44:06.530 --> 05:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
you would know that you can't just get
 
05:44:08.990 --> 05:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
the glass fixed I mean when they do that
 
05:44:10.548 --> 05:44:10.558 align:start position:0%
when the course of selling you the car
 
05:44:10.558 --> 05:44:11.930 align:start position:0%
when the course of selling you the car
well

05:44:11.930 --> 05:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:44:14.270 --> 05:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
not necessarily because you have I don't
 
05:44:15.410 --> 05:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
know I don't know what the dealers do
 
05:44:17.690 --> 05:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
they might want to talk to that you know
 
05:44:19.850 --> 05:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
we we're after the fact they're not here
 
05:44:21.708 --> 05:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:44:24.410 --> 05:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
um but anyway you should be told yeah
 
05:44:27.948 --> 05:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
and we we do when we when we service you
 
05:44:30.110 --> 05:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
if someone mentioned it we read the VIN
 
05:44:32.530 --> 05:44:32.540 align:start position:0%
number and we know on that VIN number
 
05:44:35.930 --> 05:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
what exact piece of glass needs to go in
 
05:44:37.628 --> 05:44:37.638 align:start position:0%
and how to
 
05:44:39.590 --> 05:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
recalibrate the system
 
05:44:39.600 --> 05:44:41.208 align:start position:0%
recalibrate the system
now

05:44:41.208 --> 05:44:41.218 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:44:43.190 --> 05:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
there again there are some someone
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned the term unscrupulous and
 
05:44:47.390 --> 05:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
there are some bad actors out there this
 
05:44:49.310 --> 05:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
really doesn't prohibit them from doing
 
05:44:51.590 --> 05:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
the glass work but it does require them
 
05:44:53.570 --> 05:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
to inform you as a consumer whether you
 
05:44:55.610 --> 05:44:55.620 align:start position:0%
need to have it recalibrated or they did
 
05:44:57.288 --> 05:44:57.298 align:start position:0%
it and did successfully
 
05:45:00.708 --> 05:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
we try to keep it as simple as possible
 
05:45:02.390 --> 05:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
representing us
 
05:45:04.788 --> 05:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh would you
 
05:45:06.650 --> 05:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
05:45:08.150 --> 05:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
some people
 
05:45:11.330 --> 05:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh when they buy a new car don't buy it
 
05:45:13.208 --> 05:45:13.218 align:start position:0%
through a dealer that they can talk to
 
05:45:16.250 --> 05:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh specifically would you believe that a
 
05:45:18.770 --> 05:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
friend told me yesterday that she bought
 
05:45:21.110 --> 05:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
her new car online and then it was
 
05:45:23.890 --> 05:45:23.900 align:start position:0%
shipped up to her from South Carolina
 
05:45:26.570 --> 05:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
and there was no dealer for her to talk
 
05:45:35.230 --> 05:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:38.090 --> 05:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
we had that legislation several years
 
05:45:41.810 --> 05:45:41.820 align:start position:0%
ago dealing with that problem so and by
 
05:45:43.128 --> 05:45:43.138 align:start position:0%
the way I'm just trying not to use the
 
05:45:45.890 --> 05:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
term brown bag and white bags because
 
05:45:47.750 --> 05:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
you learn more than you ever wanted to
 
05:45:49.910 --> 05:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
know about bagging and yes that
 
05:45:49.920 --> 05:45:51.548 align:start position:0%
know about bagging and yes that
complicated

05:45:51.548 --> 05:45:51.558 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
05:45:54.048 --> 05:45:54.058 align:start position:0%
now are you from Ohio then what's that
 
05:45:55.730 --> 05:45:55.740 align:start position:0%

05:46:04.190 --> 05:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
Columbus there's a brown bag Dolly and I
 
05:46:05.990 --> 05:46:06.000 align:start position:0%

I am proud to work for a company that
 
05:47:21.948 --> 05:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
takes safety seriously as evidenced by
 
05:47:24.230 --> 05:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
its membership in the auto glass Safety

Council or agsc an agsc members such as
 
05:47:30.890 --> 05:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
Glass America follow the auto glass
 
05:47:33.910 --> 05:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
replacement safety standard
 
05:47:36.410 --> 05:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
voluntary industry standard approved by
 
05:47:38.448 --> 05:47:38.458 align:start position:0%

years

05:47:42.070 --> 05:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:47:45.048 --> 05:47:45.058 align:start position:0%
agsc members also agree to random
 
05:47:47.448 --> 05:47:47.458 align:start position:0%
independent third-party audits to only
 
05:47:50.810 --> 05:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
employ agsc trained and certified glass
 
05:47:53.390 --> 05:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
technicians it's my understanding that
 
05:47:55.368 --> 05:47:55.378 align:start position:0%
the agsc has submitted written
 
05:47:58.010 --> 05:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
testimonies in support of this bill
 
05:48:00.410 --> 05:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
technology is rapidly changing the
 
05:48:02.628 --> 05:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
industry and auto glass companies such
 
05:48:04.610 --> 05:48:04.620 align:start position:0%
as Glass America and its technicians
 
05:48:06.830 --> 05:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
need to be up on the latest changes and
 
05:48:09.170 --> 05:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
safety guidelines modern vehicles
 
05:48:11.690 --> 05:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
equipped with electronic safety features
 
05:48:13.910 --> 05:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
need to be thoroughly reviewed prior to
 
05:48:16.070 --> 05:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
windshield replacement and the camera in
 
05:48:17.990 --> 05:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
the windshield absolutely needs to be
 
05:48:20.448 --> 05:48:20.458 align:start position:0%
recalibrated once the new windshield is
 
05:48:24.770 --> 05:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
then installed we agree that HB 304 will
 
05:48:26.930 --> 05:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
make sure that the customers are fully
 
05:48:28.730 --> 05:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
informed regarding the recalibration
 
05:48:31.128 --> 05:48:31.138 align:start position:0%
process and the vehicles are returned to
 
05:48:33.890 --> 05:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
them in their same safe working order we
 
05:48:35.930 --> 05:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
might suggest that if the legislature is
 
05:48:38.448 --> 05:48:38.458 align:start position:0%
to examine Auto Glass safety it should
 
05:48:40.850 --> 05:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
not limit itself to calibration issues
 
05:48:43.128 --> 05:48:43.138 align:start position:0%
but look at all the issues covered by
 
05:48:46.730 --> 05:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
the agsc safety standard
 
05:48:49.310 --> 05:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
in reviewing the bill one element that
 
05:48:52.310 --> 05:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
we found to be a little confusing was to
 
05:48:54.230 --> 05:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
ensure that the requirements of section
 
05:48:56.810 --> 05:48:56.820 align:start position:0%
4 notifying the customer if a
 
05:48:59.810 --> 05:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
recalibration was not performed or not
 
05:49:02.628 --> 05:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
completed successfully is done in the
 
05:49:05.570 --> 05:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
invoice after work is completed and not
 
05:49:07.190 --> 05:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
in the description of the work to be
 
05:49:10.548 --> 05:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
done required in section three perhaps a
 
05:49:12.890 --> 05:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
few words added to section 4 can clarify
 
05:49:14.810 --> 05:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
that I thank you for your time and
 
05:49:16.610 --> 05:49:16.620 align:start position:0%
interest and I'm happy to answer any
 
05:49:20.090 --> 05:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:20.100 --> 05:49:24.610 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:49:24.610 --> 05:49:24.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:27.048 --> 05:49:27.058 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:49:29.650 --> 05:49:29.660 align:start position:0%
okay having no
 
05:49:32.570 --> 05:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
more cards we will close the public
 
05:49:35.810 --> 05:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
hearing on 304. so
 
05:49:37.910 --> 05:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
um for those who are still here uh yes
 
05:49:40.788 --> 05:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
we will not be here tomorrow
 
05:49:43.190 --> 05:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
all right we're all done and then in
 
05:49:45.350 --> 05:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
terms of next week
 
05:49:47.810 --> 05:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm I uh I'm gonna give everybody
 
05:49:49.850 --> 05:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
an extra day off so we're not going to
 
05:49:49.860 --> 05:49:51.110 align:start position:0%
an extra day off so we're not going to
bother

05:49:51.110 --> 05:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
bother
 
05:49:53.810 --> 05:49:53.820 align:start position:0%
um doing anything on Tuesday
 
05:49:56.628 --> 05:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
um and so it's the assumption is that
 
05:49:58.250 --> 05:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to have a session
 
05:50:00.830 --> 05:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
both Wednesday and Thursday given that
 
05:50:03.770 --> 05:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
all all these bills and then I my past
 
05:50:05.270 --> 05:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
experience is that it's going to take
 
05:50:07.730 --> 05:50:07.740 align:start position:0%
two days I mean you know fortunately for
 
05:50:10.750 --> 05:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
Commerce uh it won't won't be very long
 
05:50:13.610 --> 05:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
it'll be a quickie but I'm sure other
 
05:50:15.708 --> 05:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
committees will be much more time
 
05:50:17.510 --> 05:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
consuming when when will this committee
 
05:50:18.970 --> 05:50:18.980 align:start position:0%
meeting okay
 
05:50:23.210 --> 05:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
so we will be back
 
05:50:23.220 --> 05:50:23.448 align:start position:0%
so we will be back
[Music]

05:50:23.448 --> 05:50:23.458 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:50:23.458 --> 05:50:24.590 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:50:24.590 --> 05:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:26.810 --> 05:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
the March
 
05:50:31.310 --> 05:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
7th 8th ninth week that week and I will
 
05:50:34.190 --> 05:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
I um and when I'll be doing what will be
 
05:50:36.048 --> 05:50:36.058 align:start position:0%
doing that that first week because we
 
05:50:38.330 --> 05:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
have we have to have everything out of
 
05:50:42.530 --> 05:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
committee by uh March 16th
 
05:50:44.390 --> 05:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
which I believe is a Thursday so that
 
05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
means we will be subcommitting
 
05:50:49.548 --> 05:50:49.558 align:start position:0%
um to the different committees we'll be
 
05:50:52.128 --> 05:50:52.138 align:start position:0%
subcommitting those two uh that first
 
05:50:52.138 --> 05:50:53.030 align:start position:0%
subcommitting those two uh that first
week

05:50:53.030 --> 05:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
week
 
05:50:55.910 --> 05:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
so expect to that on that too you know
 
05:50:57.890 --> 05:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
that well schedule
 
05:50:59.868 --> 05:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
um I mean how does everybody feel about
 
05:51:02.390 --> 05:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
meeting in another room Tuesday so that
 
05:51:03.948 --> 05:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
we don't have to come in on Thursdays
 
05:51:07.090 --> 05:51:07.100 align:start position:0%
how do people
 
05:51:07.100 --> 05:51:09.010 align:start position:0%
how do people
Judd

05:51:09.010 --> 05:51:09.020 align:start position:0%
Judd
 
05:51:11.390 --> 05:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
well because normally we're supposed to
 
05:51:12.650 --> 05:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
as a committee we're supposed to be
 
05:51:14.810 --> 05:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
Wednesday Thursday
 
05:51:17.150 --> 05:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
and the problem for me you know it's
 
05:51:18.770 --> 05:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
only my problem is that we have
 
05:51:20.810 --> 05:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
Chairman's meetings on Tuesday Mornings
 
05:51:22.910 --> 05:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
so I hate to just come in just for the
 
05:51:25.190 --> 05:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
meeting so that's why I would prefer to
 
05:51:27.288 --> 05:51:27.298 align:start position:0%
do Tuesday Wednesday
 
05:51:29.270 --> 05:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
and then give and then have Thursday
 
05:51:32.390 --> 05:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
free so expect that that would be March
 
05:51:36.410 --> 05:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
7th and 8th and I will schedule I will
 
05:51:38.570 --> 05:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
schedule everything we have left into a
 
05:51:39.830 --> 05:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we'll have an
 
05:51:41.510 --> 05:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about all the bills
 
05:51:42.770 --> 05:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
we have left
 
05:51:46.070 --> 05:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:48.410 --> 05:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
we've seen them all
 
05:51:51.410 --> 05:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
it was put the pedal to the metal and we
 
05:51:52.910 --> 05:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
got her done
 
05:51:55.010 --> 05:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
um so having said that then the
 
05:51:57.410 --> 05:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
following week again we'll have a
 
05:51:59.690 --> 05:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
wrap-up cleanup of all the subcommittee
 
05:52:04.548 --> 05:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
works but that uh by the the 15th
 
05:52:07.190 --> 05:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
The Ides of March
 
05:52:10.548 --> 05:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
we will exec every bill that's left in
 
05:52:10.558 --> 05:52:11.868 align:start position:0%
we will exec every bill that's left in
committee

05:52:11.868 --> 05:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:52:14.570 --> 05:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
okay now many people think it's a Marvel
 
05:52:16.610 --> 05:52:16.620 align:start position:0%
that we do the Commerce does that but
 
05:52:17.990 --> 05:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's because we do everything through
 
05:52:20.390 --> 05:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so by the time we have the
 
05:52:22.850 --> 05:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
full committee we just
 
05:52:22.860 --> 05:52:24.830 align:start position:0%
full committee we just
we

05:52:24.830 --> 05:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:52:27.530 --> 05:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
that's how that's how I've done it for
 
05:52:29.868 --> 05:52:29.878 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years believe it or not and
 
05:52:31.490 --> 05:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'm like I think I'm the only committee
 
05:52:32.990 --> 05:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
that Congress is the only committee who
 
05:52:34.548 --> 05:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
did it but but I know it was good
 
05:52:36.048 --> 05:52:36.058 align:start position:0%
because when Ed Butler was in the chair
 
05:52:42.250 --> 05:52:42.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:46.310 --> 05:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
so with that uh you guys all have a
 
05:52:46.320 --> 05:52:48.288 align:start position:0%
so with that uh you guys all have a
wonderful

05:52:48.288 --> 05:52:48.298 align:start position:0%
wonderful
