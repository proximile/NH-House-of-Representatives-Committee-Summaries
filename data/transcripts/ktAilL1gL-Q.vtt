00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
last week we were going over
 
00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
one of the budgets and we were dealing
 
00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 align:start position:0%
with uh rents i believe it isn't was in
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
the management area
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
and representative rogers remembered a
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
historical conversation that had been
 
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.189 align:start position:0%
historical conversation that had been
had

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh on the rents in the rochester office
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
and uh i i was unaware of it i don't
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
know the committee's history
 
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to thank her for
 
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
two reasons one for being willing to
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh open up and ask questions and and two
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh if a question or information is of a
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
historical note
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's particularly important to me
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
because i don't have uh your shared
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
history so
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
all right so uh i think
 
00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
i want to do one more thing before
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
getting started
 
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative earth asked me last week
 
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
what numbers i was citing when i would
 
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
say things like
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
ah that line looks like it's up 32
 
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.309 align:start position:0%
ah that line looks like it's up 32
percent

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
and um for for the committee members
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh if uh since you have this excel sheet
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
there are four columns on the right of
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
the excel sheet of the governor's budget
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
and basically i just did a really simple
 
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.430 align:start position:0%
and basically i just did a really simple
indicator

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
indicator
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
it's not meant to be real math it's just
 
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
meant to be
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
a tool to highlight line items where
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
i took the fy actual and the fy adjusted
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
added them together and divided by two
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
to get kind of a base
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
from there i took the governor's
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
recommended budget for 22 and 23 added
 
00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:50.150 align:start position:0%
recommended budget for 22 and 23 added
them

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
together and divided by two to get a
 
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.830 align:start position:0%
together and divided by two to get a
projection

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
projection
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
so then i took the projection minus the
 
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:57.990 align:start position:0%
so then i took the projection minus the
base

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
base
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
just to get a delta and then i did a
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
percentage on that delta
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
and i know that there are at least five
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
things wrong with doing that
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
if this were real math but the only
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
reason i'm doing that
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
is to give me sort of a visual
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
flag on which line items seem to be
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
out of ordinary or worth further
 
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.790 align:start position:0%
out of ordinary or worth further
explanation

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
so i hope that that is clear to everyone
 
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
that was curious where i was pulling
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
these numbers
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
um all right well um are there any
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
comments from the committee before we
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
get started i think our first person up
 
00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:38.630 align:start position:0%
get started i think our first person up
today

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
is from the division of program quality
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
and integrity but i want to check in
 
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
with everyone before we get started
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
um representative weiler you're
 
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.710 align:start position:0%
um representative weiler you're
recognized

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
well thank thank you mr chairman i heard
 
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.150 align:start position:0%
well thank thank you mr chairman i heard
a

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
comment and i put it in the minutes that
 
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.190 align:start position:0%
comment and i put it in the minutes that
the

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
general fund was up 45 in
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
hhs now maybe mr ripple would know
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
was that one particular area or is it
 
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
in general funds if it is that's a shock
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
um well i don't believe the general
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
funds are up 45
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
compared to the 21 budget that number
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
might have come
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
from 20 actuals versus the 22 budget but
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i'd have to take a look
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so so let's have a quick
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
conversation about that
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
um representative weiler did a really
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
great job as i was sort of surprised
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
at the thoroughness of the notes that he
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
took just because he you know he's so
 
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.190 align:start position:0%
took just because he you know he's so
busy

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
busy
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
but um so he sent them to me i made
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
some very minor modifications i sent him
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
to representative erf
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
what's what's the standard way that we
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative norgren thank you for
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
joining us
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
um so um what's the standard way
 
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519 align:start position:0%
in which we circulate the minutes before
 
00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:02.630 align:start position:0%
in which we circulate the minutes before
we

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
vote and and do we vote on those minutes
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
in order to make them official i
 
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
i kind of need a class about minute
 
00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:15.190 align:start position:0%
i kind of need a class about minute
management

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
do you want to do you want to say what
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
you think representative wallner or
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
representative norgren what do you guys
 
00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:21.110 align:start position:0%
representative norgren what do you guys
think

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative wall are you
 
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.550 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative wall are you
recognized

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
um i don't think in the past we have
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
taken votes on
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
minutes but i i do believe in the last
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
and kathy can correct me if i'm wrong i
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
believe in the last session
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
um kathy was the clerk
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
on division three and she distributed
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
her minutes to
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
um all members and obviously they were
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
put on file with um
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
with the the work notes of the uh of the
 
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.069 align:start position:0%
with the the work notes of the uh of the
division

00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we ever actually voted
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
on them
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
okay so to paraphrase it sounds like
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
they're more working notes than they are
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
official minutes is that fair what i
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
would do
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
last time is um i would send out the
 
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.150 align:start position:0%
last time is um i would send out the
minutes

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
15 minutes i took them on my computer
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
and i would send them out
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
between 15 minutes and half an hour
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
after we ended our session
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
to all the members of the division and
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
um any corrections anybody have i'd make
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
and send them out the next day with the
 
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.949 align:start position:0%
and send them out the next day with the
corrections

00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
um so everybody had them so they could
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
look at them that night to see
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
refresh their memory of what we went
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
over so they were working minutes um
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
i mean i i had a habit from law school
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
days i could do pretty much
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
transcriptional minutes
 
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
and they just went out um that i mean
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
ken seen my minutes before
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
and i would send them out that day so
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
that people had a working um
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
knowledge and memory of what went on
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
that day um
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
so they had it for the next day and they
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
were working minutes and i sent them to
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
so so i so thank you for that and i
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
noticed you didn't volunteer to be the
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
clerk this term but i'll put that aside
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
for now
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
no no it's it's it's very hard work to
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
be the clerk so
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
i used to um be blackmailed into being
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
the clerk in the past
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
so i i i i have nothing on you
 
00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:19.430 align:start position:0%
so i i i i have nothing on you
apparently

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
finance committee we've never had a real
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
formal process it's whatever the clerk
 
00:12:27.839 --> 00:12:28.310 align:start position:0%
formal process it's whatever the clerk
and

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
the chair of the division can come up
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
with and
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
most of the time uh i would turn in
 
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.949 align:start position:0%
most of the time uh i would turn in
handwritten

00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
handwritten
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
minutes to uh janet she'd put him in the
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
file and she'll say
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
i'll type them out come a break in the
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
in the summer or fall
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
but they were rarely ever uh typed out
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to do that this time
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
kathy has led the way here but i i can't
 
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
do transcriptions like she can but
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
i try to get as much as i can in detail
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
especially answering to questions
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
because it'll come up later didn't
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
didn't we ask that question what was the
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
answer and a lot of times
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
we don't get an answer we'll try
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
so um so i think technically i'm gonna
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
consider the notes uh to be working
 
00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:15.190 align:start position:0%
consider the notes uh to be working
notes

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
notes
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
and not official minutes and then we'll
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
put them into the committee record and
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
mr ripple if you find out
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
that that's the wrong category but you
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
know let me know
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay we'll just try to figure out the
 
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.430 align:start position:0%
okay we'll just try to figure out the
process

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
all right are there any other questions
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
before we get started or comments
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
from anyone um
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
okay i think we're going to have the
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
division of program quality and
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
integrity up first
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
meredith telus i think is her
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
pronunciation and then
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
what we'll go ahead all the way through
 
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.590 align:start position:0%
what we'll go ahead all the way through
the

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
slide deck and then we'll go into the
 
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.590 align:start position:0%
slide deck and then we'll go into the
relevant

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh accounting documents so that we go
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
from top to bottom without interruption
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
is later and i'm kind of hoping to to
 
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:04.870 align:start position:0%
is later and i'm kind of hoping to to
finish

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
finish
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
by about two two o'clock 205
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
there's a hearing at 2 15 that that i
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
i'd like to testify on so um so we'll
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
try to maintain a little pace
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
and i got some feedback that 20 minutes
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough for lunch last time
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
so so we'll go to 25 minutes this time
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
um but uh all right so so
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%

representative rogers did last session
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
and that was very helpful
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that i was hitting all
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
the follow-up questions as well
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh i think that's a very fair request
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
and we'll honor it i think
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
that with this first set of minutes
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know figure out what our process is
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
and it'll get smoother and quicker i
 
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.590 align:start position:0%
and it'll get smoother and quicker i
believe

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%

i can do that um so as i said
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
my name is meredith telus i am the
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
division director for the division of
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
program quality and integrity and i'm
 
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
going to start just by looking at the
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
agenda with you folks let you know what
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to go over today
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
so first just an overview of the
 
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.670 align:start position:0%
so first just an overview of the
division

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have a conversation about
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
the bureaus that make up the division
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
and each of those bureaus key functions
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
key partners the accomplishments key
 
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.749 align:start position:0%
key partners the accomplishments key
challenges

00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
financial summary information and then
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
last i have a discussion of the
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
department audits there had been a
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
question about
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
audits that the department has been
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
subjected to
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
and i have some information on that a
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
the division um is relatively
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
new we were technically created by
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
executive order
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
in 2019 to be responsible for
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
the items that you see listed here these
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
are actually bullet points from our
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
executive order
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
so outcomes performance measures and
 
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.789 align:start position:0%
so outcomes performance measures and
accountability

00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
strategic and operational planning data
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
reporting and analysis
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
business process analysis project
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
management and implementation internal
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
audit and enterprise risk management
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
that was in the spring of 2019 the
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
executive order was issued and over the
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
summer and fall of 2019
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh the department leadership really did
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
some consideration of what work
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
um is engaged here and what would make
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
sense for organization
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
of this division and so it was really in
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
late 2019 we were kind of fully
 
00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.270 align:start position:0%
late 2019 we were kind of fully
incorporated

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
incorporated
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
and pulled together two existing bureaus
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
within the department
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
with the hopes of continuing each of
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
those bureau's current functions
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
as well as eventually being able to
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
offer kind of new functionality
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
within the department so the two bureaus
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
that really had a nexus
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
to the intended work of the division
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
were the bureau of program
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
quality and the bureau of program
 
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.230 align:start position:0%
quality and the bureau of program
integrity

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
and i've listed here their former names
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
we've just changed our name
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
relatively recently uh because you may
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
see them referenced this way
 
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
in the budget document itself it may
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
show up in the briefing book or other
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
documentation that you see
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
so i want you to be able to recognize
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
both versions
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
the bureau of quality assurance and
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
improvement is now the bureau of program
 
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.430 align:start position:0%
improvement is now the bureau of program
quality

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
quality
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
and the prior bureau of improvement
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
integrity is now the bureau of program
 
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.669 align:start position:0%
integrity is now the bureau of program
integrity

00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
the names are just simpler clearer
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
and and fit well with what these bureaus
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
actually do
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'll stop there for just a minute and
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
see yes with questions
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
okay so so administratively i'm i'm
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
trying not to
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
interrupt you in mid-sentence so i'll
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
wave at you if we've got a question to
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
ask you
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
that would be great okay so um so my
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
question on this
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
is that i'm aware that there are several
 
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.350 align:start position:0%
is that i'm aware that there are several
efforts

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
to take good executive orders and to
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
craft amendments to put them into bills
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
so that we can turn this into
 
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.830 align:start position:0%
so that we can turn this into
legislation

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
so that i know that that's generally
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
occurring do you know
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
if anyone is specifically working on
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
formal legislation for your department
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
so that you have statutory authority
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
no i don't believe that's the case so
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
technically is it
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
true then that if the executive state of
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
emergency were to end tomorrow
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
and the executive order was to go away
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
your department would have no authority
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
to continue
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
it's not the case um thank goodness for
 
00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:01.029 align:start position:0%
it's not the case um thank goodness for
me

00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
and for us it's not we weren't created
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
by one of the emergency orders we were
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
created by an executive order
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
so that will continue to stand because
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
this executive order was created prior
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay and executive orders stand
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
beyond a single governor as well
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
so this executive order would continue
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity unless it was
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
fully rescinded at some point
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
okay so so ms rounds uh
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
if if if you if you could uh help us
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see if we can figure out if
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
there's a legislator who's working on
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislation to shift this from being an
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
executive order to uh legislation
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me like for the
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
employees of this division
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
it would be a little unsettling not to
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
to have a
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay yes i can um pass that on to
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
john williams my not to my knowledge i
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
think as meredith stated there there is
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
not anything currently in legislation
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
planned for this representative waller
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
has a question so thank you for your
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
answer mr jones
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative thank you um
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
meredith as you go through your
 
00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:20.710 align:start position:0%
meredith as you go through your
presentation

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
can you um let us know if there are
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
areas of your division that
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
have um corresponding um
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
sections in house bill 2
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
or if you don't i think last week
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
someone said they hadn't seen house bill
 
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.710 align:start position:0%
someone said they hadn't seen house bill
2.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
2.
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
we have a draft but if there were things
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
that you requested
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
that you wanted in-house bill to
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
um and then we can we'll have a
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
check on whether they're there or not i
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative walner i
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
have not seen house bill 2 either
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
but i don't anticipate there are any
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
specific and karen maybe you can
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
chime in on this too i don't believe
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
there are any specific items related to
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
this division that would be in house
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
bill 2.
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so i don't think so yep
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
if even when i do see it if i think of
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
anything i will certainly let you know
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay there was one section that
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
particularly jumped out at me and maybe
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
i'm in
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's in the wrong i'm asking at the
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
wrong time
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
but um in section 38 of house bill of
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
the draft house bill
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
who knows of what section will be when
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's finalized but
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
um there is 10 million dollars for
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
um to follow up on a report
 
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
done by alvarez and
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's about certain um
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
agency operations resulting in greater
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and accountability
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i didn't know whether that would be
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
in your department if that's in your
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
area or not
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i yes i hear what you're
 
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
talking about um
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
that is really i believe across the
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
department karen i'm looking for you to
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
nod her shaker yes she's nodding
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
that is it it would tie with my division
 
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
but not my division alone
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
um so the follow-up to that report
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
is going to really land across the
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
division in multiple
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
areas okay so maybe maybe i can um
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
follow up with karen
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
or karen could follow up with us about
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
that report okay
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely i think that language yeah
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
could could be um
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
discussed independently put it that way
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
there you go so since we're going to be
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
breaking brush
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
on the on the spreadsheet later uh miss
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
rounds if you could uh
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
draw our attention to the line items
 
00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:43.909 align:start position:0%
draw our attention to the line items
that

00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
would address representative wallner's
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that um spread out over multiple
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
requirements at this point
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
we could talk yes we can talk about that
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
later yes
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking all those
 
00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:02.310 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking all those
questions

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you representative i
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the idea of giving it
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
more continuity by putting it in
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
that would be welcome um i do want to
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
point out what you see
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
here for the our general
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities the things listed here
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
identifying outcomes and performance
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
measures and accountabilities and
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
strategic planning
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
and auditing and risk management
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
those are all important functions and i
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
don't want anyone to think that the
 
00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:29.669 align:start position:0%
don't want anyone to think that the
department

00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't engaged in those functions prior
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
to the establishment of this division
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
of course every program area across the
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
division is engaged in this kind of work
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
in one way or another
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
but i think the establishment of the
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
division was really a recognition
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
that it's not necessarily their area of
 
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.470 align:start position:0%
that it's not necessarily their area of
expertise

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
each of the program areas are experts in
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
their program areas so their populations
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
their provider networks
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
national best practices there's a lot of
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
things that they're engaged in at the
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
same time that they're trying to do this
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
kind of work
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
and so the establishment of the division
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
was a way of kind of trying to
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
centralize expertise
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
in these areas so that we can partner
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
with the program areas and they can get
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
on with their day jobs
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
while being able to rely on us to to
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
build some of these skills and practices
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
and help them better achieve their goals
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to to point that out to
 
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.269 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to to point that out to
everyone

00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
and here is a slide with our contact
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
information so myself

blanchard

00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
blanchard
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
is our bureau administrator for the
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
bureau of program integrity and susan
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
brown is our bureau administrator for
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
the bureau of program quality
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
and they're both on this call today for
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
when you ask me difficult
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
questions you can call any of us
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
at any time and we'll work together to
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
get you an answer for any questions you
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
this is our mission statement and i'm
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
not going to read it to you but i will i
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
will pause and give you a minute to read
 
00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:08.870 align:start position:0%
will pause and give you a minute to read
it

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
and you will note we don't have a vision
 
00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:12.470 align:start position:0%
and you will note we don't have a vision
statement

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm a little slow uh my
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
question here is under financial
 
00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.350 align:start position:0%
question here is under financial
integrity

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
um if if if for example and i'm sure
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
it's not happening
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
but if for example we were receiving
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
federal money
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
for program x and we weren't precisely
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
within the scope of x
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
would this office be the key accountable
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
office for just
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
figuring that out and reporting it there
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
are a couple different areas so
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
every program area and all the finance
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
managers are also responsible for
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
ensuring compliance of course
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
but yes we do have the internal audit
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
function so
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
if we are doing a review of that area
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
we'd be uncovering that kind of thing
 
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
we also have um
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
a grants administrator who sits within
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
our contracts unit
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
and she is
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
primarily working on establishing the
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
internal controls that will help each of
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
the program areas and each of the
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
finance managers make sure they're
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
in compliance on a regular basis so
 
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.390 align:start position:0%
in compliance on a regular basis so
that's

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
one we also have the inter we have the
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
internal audit function in our division
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
and another
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
um key function that we perform is we
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
really facilitate audits when auditors
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
come to us which is why i'm doing a
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
presentation on department-wide audits
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
at the end of the
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
at the end of this um so
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
for example our single audit of federal
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
funds is really our biggest
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
um biggest audit there but it's also the
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
case that um
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
a federal agency or the oig could come
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
in and audit a specific
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
area when there are findings there our
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
division would
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
work with the program area and the
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
finance managers to say all right here
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
are your findings
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
what are you going to do to fix it so
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
we're really pushing on the corrective
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
action plans to make sure those things
 
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
get remediated
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
timely so just as a thought
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
i think lba does what they consider to
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
be an external audit
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
and if you're also doing audits but
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
they're internal in nature
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
having that in your mission statement
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
may help
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
yep that's a great point that's a great
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
point i appreciate that thank you
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative because we are
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
this year i hope to finalize our mission
 
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:27.669 align:start position:0%
this year i hope to finalize our mission
statement

00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
also develop a vision statement and then
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
create some kind of
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
key performance measures and goals for
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
our own division
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
so i'll start with the bureau of program
 
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.029 align:start position:0%
so i'll start with the bureau of program
integrity

00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
when you think program integrity you can
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
think largely financial
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
integrity and fiscal integrity these are
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
really the key controls related to cost
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
containment and reductions in
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
overpayments so you'll see there's six
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
units listed here and i'll go over their
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
functions in detail but just just
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
generally to know
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
they're really looking at accountability
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
and integrity as related to finance
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
so the first two areas are
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
exclusively related to medicaid and
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
you'll notice as i go through and i
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
think this this makes sense to you
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
because it's it's true of most of
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
um ocom um we don't
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
have you know key populations or
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries the way a lot of the
 
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
programs that you'll be talking to in
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
the coming weeks we're really
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
serving either another division within
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
or program area within the department or
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
one of our federal partners
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
so in this case these two units
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
are serving medicaid so that we're in
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
compliance with some
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
cms regulations and the first is the
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
medicaid program integrity unit
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
so this unit yes has basically the same
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
name as the bureau but that's because
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
federally they're referred to as program
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
integrity so it's the same name
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
medicaid program integrity is
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
focused on providers medicaid providers
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
so they're they're responsible for um
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
prevention detection and recovery of
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
fraud waste and abuse
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
for medicaid providers most of what we
 
00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.389 align:start position:0%
for medicaid providers most of what we
find

00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
is waste or abuse i don't want anyone to
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
think there's rampant fraud
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
but we do a lot of provider education
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
and we do that
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
in partnership with the individual
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
program areas so let's say
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's like a dental provider we would
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
work with dr finney
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
in the division of medicaid services to
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
educate that provider it's a lot of
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
provider education maybe sloppy billing
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
maybe sloppy documentation
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
and if it's something we see
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
continuously we'll talk about doing
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
broader provider trainings for that
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
provider type maybe something changed in
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and they didn't
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
catch it
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
so we do a lot of that um
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
but we do occasionally find instances of
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
suspected fraud and where there's a
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
credible allegation of fraud we would
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
then make a referral
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
to the medicaid fraud control unit at
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
the doj
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
affectionately called mafuku and that
 
00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:18.549 align:start position:0%
affectionately called mafuku and that
happens

00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis we make referrals to
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
mafuku so
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
there might have been a you might have
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
seen a press release um last week or the
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
week before
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
i think um two main
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
individuals were arrested um
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
based on an investigation that we had
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
started and referred over
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
and it was for home health i think we
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
found um
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
instances of billing where the where the
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
individual the client was not at home
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
so they're innocent until proven guilty
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
but still um that's just an example of
 
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:49.909 align:start position:0%
but still um that's just an example of
the

00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
kind of work being done uh
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
so specified doj is the federal or the
 
00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.149 align:start position:0%
so specified doj is the federal or the
state

00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
that's state level doj thank you
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and i'm just going to say i can
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
actually only see a few
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
faces so if other people have questions
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
um they may need to just speak out the
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
way it works
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to ask me and then i
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
ask you okay
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you i can see you that's all that
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
um so that is uh medicaid programming
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
oh they are also responsible for
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
provider enrollment
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
so they have to do the screenings of all
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
of our medicaid providers
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
upon initial enrollment and then upon
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
revalidation which is done every five
 
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.190 align:start position:0%
revalidation which is done every five
years

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're they're not on any
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
blacklists and they have the proper
 
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.029 align:start position:0%
blacklists and they have the proper
credentials

00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
credentials
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
our third-party liability unit as i'm
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
sure you're all aware
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
medicaid is the payer of last resort uh
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
which means that anybody who has
 
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.590 align:start position:0%
which means that anybody who has
medicare

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
medicare
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
or any third-party insurance we need to
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that insurance is paying first
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
and then medicaid pays after so that
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
means we have to have proper edits up in
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
our system
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
so that we can um reject claims that
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
should be or deny claims that should be
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
covered by another insurance first
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
and then um and then if for some reason
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
we didn't know about the other insurance
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
and find out later then we have to go
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
back and and properly bill them or build
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
a provider and make sure that medicaid
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
recoups the dollars
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
so um this these are both areas
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
medicaid program integrity and
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
third-party liability where the work has
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
really shifted a lot in the last four or
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
five years and i have a slide that's
 
00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:35.669 align:start position:0%
five years and i have a slide that's
gonna

00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
kind of show a chart where you'll be
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
able to see that
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
because our population has migrated
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
out of fee for service where we are
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
doing the work ourselves we're doing the
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
the um review of claims for program
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
integrity and we're doing the
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
review of other insurances for
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
third-party liability
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
we're now in a position where we need to
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
do a lot of oversight of our managed
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
care organizations
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
so that's really shifted the focus of
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
how the staff are engaged
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
and we had to develop a lot of reporting
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
structures to get the information out of
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
the mcos and we have to liaise with the
 
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:09.990 align:start position:0%
the mcos and we have to liaise with the
mcos

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
mcos
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're doing this work to
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
our standards
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
and simultaneously we're still actually
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
doing the work for those that remain in
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
the fee for service
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
population and of course for long-term
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
supports and services that's all
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
in the fee-for-service population
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
any questions on these slides
 
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.230 align:start position:0%
any questions on these slides
okay

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
so then we have two units that are
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
largely focused on medicaid
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
and and food nutrition services a food
 
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:39.669 align:start position:0%
and and food nutrition services a food
stamp

00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
stamp
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
um the quality assurance unit and
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
special investigations unit
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
so quality assurance does
 
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
audits of food stamp eligibility and
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
this is a really kind of regimented
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
formulaic process because because it's
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
all um
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
very clearly spelled out in fns
 
00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.950 align:start position:0%
very clearly spelled out in fns
regulations

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
we have to develop a sample size every
 
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.310 align:start position:0%
we have to develop a sample size every
month

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
and then audit all of the food stamp
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility for
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate um income levels and food
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
stamp issuances
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
and we also look at people who were
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
denied food stamps or terminated
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
and then we developed reporting that
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
goes to the feds
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
but we also have a feedback loop back to
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
the bureau family assistance that
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
actually does the eligibility
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
determinations and we have
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
a pretty robust conversation with them
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
um that's actually been been um
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
i would say developed a lot more in the
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
last year or two under myself and chris
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
santaniello we've really partnered and
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
and the group has done
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
an amazing job they've split into work
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
groups to make sure that we're really
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
getting to the root cause
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
of any errors in eligibility
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
determination so was it was it training
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
was it um uh something wrong with the
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
eligibility system new heights
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
or or documentation what is it that we
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
need to improve
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
in order to prevent these errors from
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
occurring in the first place
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
and as you may know that um error rate
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
is then usually uh submitted to the feds
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
and then they would develop a national
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
error rate and compare
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
every state to those errors that process
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
has been suspended
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
um for some time and we actually just
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
got word this morning i think it's going
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
to continue to be suspended through 2020
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal 2020 and 2021 but we are still
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
doing the reviews
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
even though the error rate development
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
is suspended we are still doing the
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
reviews and we are still
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
going to be working with bureau of
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
family assistance to
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
uh make those improvements and keep the
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
error rates down
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
our special investigation unit uh
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
investigates and prosecutes client fraud
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
so that can be in the areas of medicaid
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
tanf or food stamp benefits again
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
the fns regulations here are by far the
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
most rigorous
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
so um this unit i have a slide that i'm
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
actually going to show you because this
 
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:03.510 align:start position:0%
actually going to show you because this
unit

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
experienced some pretty hefty turnover
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's a group of investigators and
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
they're charged with
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh reviewing any referrals or
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
allegations of fraud for beneficiaries
 
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.109 align:start position:0%
allegations of fraud for beneficiaries
for

00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
assistance um we would do an
 
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.230 align:start position:0%
assistance um we would do an
investigation

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
and then um and then recoup overpayments
 
00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:22.390 align:start position:0%
and then um and then recoup overpayments
or

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
uh you know establish a claim and just
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
recruit the overpayment or if there's an
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
instance of fraud
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
we actually work with the county
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
attorneys to do prosecutions for those
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
so in the last 24 to 36 months there's
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
just been some
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
some very high turnover here that's
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
impacted the work but
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
um we do have a we have a plan
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
everybody's very well trained now we're
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
hiring a bureau of net invest
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh a bureau administrator and um
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
and have a have a good plan to bring
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
there we go so this is what i wanted to
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
display related to our recovery of
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
overpayments and what you
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
see here in the tpl recovery is this is
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
the blue line you see it going down
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
but the reason it's going down is
 
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
because where our managed care
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
organizations are now responsible for
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
doing those recoveries
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
they are keeping the money and on our
 
00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.190 align:start position:0%
they are keeping the money and on our
side

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
we are reducing the amount that we pay
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
the managed care organizations in our
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
our pmpm our per member per month
 
00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.109 align:start position:0%
our pmpm our per member per month
amounts

00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to display this change
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
because while we're trying to
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're um maximizing
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
our our cost avoidance and cost
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
recoveries for third-party liability
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's um data metrics that we've
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
had to develop with the mcos to ensure
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
seeing it in their data and then we can
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
incorporate it into our pmpm on that
 
00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.150 align:start position:0%
incorporate it into our pmpm on that
side

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
um fraud waste and abuse recoveries you
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
see here that's for both beneficiary and
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
provider overpayments so that's both
 
00:38:59.359 --> 00:39:00.150 align:start position:0%
provider overpayments so that's both
medicaid

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
program integrity and the special
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
investigations unit
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
on both sides so i have a question for
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
you here
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes so as i'm just looking at your
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
organization from a cost benefit
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
analysis this is
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
obviously a benefit um would you would
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
you just summarize
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
um the a number for say fy2020
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
on the amount of the recoveries
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
that actually save general funds money
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
um for the taxpayer okay are you able to
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
i don't want to put you on the spot well
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
no i just want to make sure i understand
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
the question so when you say the actual
 
00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:43.190 align:start position:0%
the question so when you say the actual
recoveries

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
recoveries
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
um these are these are total funds
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
so this would be 50 general funds
 
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.190 align:start position:0%
so this would be 50 general funds
approximately

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm just looking at you and from
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
also from a very narrow perspective
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
we're spending money on state employees
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
and rent and
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
all that and so this is this is your
 
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.109 align:start position:0%
all that and so this is this is your
profit

00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
profit
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
okay you're you you're bringing us back
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
this money right
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
you know our cost is you our
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
profit is x and i'm wondering what x is
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
so you're looking for kind of a net
 
00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.190 align:start position:0%
so you're looking for kind of a net
number

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
well first just a recovery number it
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
sounds like you just said 60
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
of the this delta 50 50
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
so 50 of what you see
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
here for total fraud waste and abuse
 
00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.750 align:start position:0%
here for total fraud waste and abuse
recoveries

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
recoveries
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
would be uh general funds approximately
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
fifty percent
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
i'm looking tasha can you not if that's
 
00:40:43.119 --> 00:40:43.430 align:start position:0%
i'm looking tasha can you not if that's
about

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that's about right yep fifty
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
percent what number would you put on
 
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:47.349 align:start position:0%
percent what number would you put on
that

00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
just for any year for
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
any year generally like not just 2020 i
 
00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:54.150 align:start position:0%
any year generally like not just 2020 i
mean

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
any of them just grab a year i'm just
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
looking for a
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
ballpark annual it would approximately
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
be the same i mean as you can see here
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
from 2017 18 19 and 20.
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
is that 500 million what what is the
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
number yep
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
yep about 500 million oh sorry 500
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
000 of general funds
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
perfect that's exactly what i was
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
and and i do know you have other
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
benefits this is just
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
one i'm not i don't i don't want to say
 
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.550 align:start position:0%
one i'm not i don't i don't want to say
that

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
this is the thing that's carrying your
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
whole operation but this is
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
this pertains to two units in particular
 
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.150 align:start position:0%
this pertains to two units in particular
not

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
the entire division um so two units are
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
really doing this work
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
and i will say what we don't see here
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
is um the
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
recoveries that the mco
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
is doing and then that is being
 
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.030 align:start position:0%
is doing and then that is being
reflected

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
reflected
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
in their data so that we can then pay
 
00:41:58.079 --> 00:41:58.470 align:start position:0%
in their data so that we can then pay
them

00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
a lower amount so this is just the
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
recoveries related to our fee for
 
00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.069 align:start position:0%
recoveries related to our fee for
service

00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
population and it doesn't really include
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
the work that we're doing
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
to partner with the mcos and say hey
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
you're doing this related to fraud waste
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
and abuse but we really need you to be
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
focused on this thing over here
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of kind of management and
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
oversight of the work that they are
 
00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.150 align:start position:0%
oversight of the work that they are
doing

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're meeting our
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
meredith can i um just add to that
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
quickly this is also one of the
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
few areas that are not restricted funds
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
that these funds actually flow
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
through to the general fund they're
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues that are
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
that ways and means considers as part of
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
so this is a slide showing our
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
beneficiary case reviews
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
and this is not my favorite information
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
but i i think it's really important to
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
show the committee
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
because we are very very much a human
 
00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.270 align:start position:0%
because we are very very much a human
capital-based

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
capital-based
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
organization i mean across the
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
department but certainly in this
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
division as well
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
and this unit experienced huge turnover
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
we lost
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
i think seven individuals first the
 
00:43:15.119 --> 00:43:16.390 align:start position:0%
i think seven individuals first the
administrator

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
and then another another maybe seven
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
individuals and they were all replaced
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
except save one
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
save one person so you can see how the
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
number of um
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
fraud cases established went down front
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
end detection
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
cases went down this was all in the last
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
like 24 to 36 months
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
the the good news is we have a plan
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
to correct this and we have staff that
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
are very well trained up now
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
and a plan to kind of bring down our
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
backlog but i just wanted to
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
to show folks how important it is
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
that we can recruit and retain really uh
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
highly skilled individuals
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
there could have been let's let's keep
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
so couple units uh for financial
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
compliance unit and our internal audit
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
these really serve a department-wide
 
00:44:14.079 --> 00:44:15.030 align:start position:0%
these really serve a department-wide
population

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
so the financial compliance unit uh has
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
one sort of key function related to
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
medicaid and that is we
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
audit uh nursing home cost reports
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid cost reports
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
to ensure that all the costs in there
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
are allowable and then we pass that on
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
to the rate setting unit in medicaid
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
finance for the purposes of setting
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
setting rates for nursing homes and then
 
00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:38.069 align:start position:0%
setting rates for nursing homes and then
another

00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
major component of the financial
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
compliance unit is that they
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
assist in all of our sub-recipient
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring so this is an area that
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
if anyone has perused the single audit
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we had findings on this
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
other state agencies have findings on
 
00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.230 align:start position:0%
other state agencies have findings on
this

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
agencies across the nation have findings
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
subrecipient monitoring is really an
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
area that's been beefed up
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
by the auditor's reviews in the last
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
decade or so
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
and we have in the last two to three
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
years really developed a robust system
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
to manage our sub recipient monitoring
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
so we now have uh protocols
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
that make us look at all of our
 
00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.109 align:start position:0%
that make us look at all of our
sub-recipients

00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
sub-recipients
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
based on risk so we're looking at and
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
when i say sub-recipient
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
the the difference between a
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
sub-recipient and any other
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
contractor that we retain is that a
 
00:45:35.119 --> 00:45:35.990 align:start position:0%
contractor that we retain is that a
contractor

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
we may be spending federal funds on it
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
but they're providing a service
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
to us to the department and so we know
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
if that service is provided well or not
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
a recipient is a little bit different we
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
are giving someone money so that they
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
can go
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
perform a bunch of services in the
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
community for our beneficiaries
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
they're not performing it for us so we
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
don't know how well they did it and
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
hence the monitoring becomes
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
really critical both financial
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
monitoring did they use
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
our money the way they were supposed to
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
use it and the programmatic monitoring
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
did they
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
do what they're supposed to be doing in
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
the terms of the of the
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
notice of award from the federal grant
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
so that process has um has really been
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
developed more and this unit in
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
particular financial compliance unit
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
works directly with the program areas
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
and the finance managers and the
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
individual program areas
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
on the financial side of that so to make
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
sure that we do expenditure testing
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
where necessary we actually audit where
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
necessary we sample timesheets where
 
00:46:34.319 --> 00:46:35.270 align:start position:0%
necessary we sample timesheets where
necessary

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the spend matches what
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
they claimed for
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
another another thing the financial
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
compliance unit is doing
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
is um we have centralized our response
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
to the single audit in particular but
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
they also work with program areas on any
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
federal audit as i was saying in
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
response to your question at the
 
00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.109 align:start position:0%
response to your question at the
beginning

00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative edwards um when we get an
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
audit from the oig for example which we
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
we are going through right now related
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
to substance use disorder
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
um medicaid payments
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
um they ask tons of questions they need
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of documentation
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
and we kind of act as a liaison between
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
the program area and the auditors
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
because we speak the auditor language so
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
when they're saying oh we need some kind
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
of documentation for this
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes the program areas don't know
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what it means or what will
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
satisfy them
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we sort of serve as an intermediary
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure those things get provided
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
and then you know in the case of the
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
single audit it's it's similar every
 
00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:32.790 align:start position:0%
single audit it's it's similar every
year

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
so it's easier for us to go back to the
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
program areas and say here's what you
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
provided last year
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
you need to do something like this is
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
what the auditors are looking for
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and the other key function that
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
financial compliance unit has been doing
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
is following up on the corrective action
 
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.190 align:start position:0%
is following up on the corrective action
plans

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
plans
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
for each of these audits so historically
 
00:47:54.079 --> 00:47:54.470 align:start position:0%
for each of these audits so historically
our

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
single audit was managed within finance
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
which is fine because the finance
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
managers know all the answers
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
um but the problem is when it comes to
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
the corrective action plan they also
 
00:48:05.599 --> 00:48:06.069 align:start position:0%
the corrective action plan they also
have

00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
day jobs that they're trying to manage
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
and be very responsive to the needs of
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the program areas and department
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
leadership and house division three when
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
they have questions that need responding
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
to within 24 hours
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
so we moved the responsibility for
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
managing the corrective action plans
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
into the financial compliance unit
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
and in doing that we managed to bring
 
00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:26.710 align:start position:0%
and in doing that we managed to bring
down

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
the number of outstanding findings from
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
prior years
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
by by many i mean maybe a dozen a lot of
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
outstanding findings have been
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
now mitigated because we just kind of
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
put a spotlight on it
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
and concentrated on it until we could
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
get through to the end we've also
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
brought down the number of
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
overall findings um and i think that
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
that is is partly a function of being
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
able to just manage the documentation
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
and know what auditors are looking for
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
our internal audit function is
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
relatively new
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
um in the last couple of years and
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
so far has been really doing
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
what i'll call kind of cleanup and it's
 
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:06.470 align:start position:0%
what i'll call kind of cleanup and it's
just

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
establishing um a sense of department
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
internal controls
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
so for example um managed to
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
issue guidance templates information
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
about policies and procedures across the
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
department and what we expect the
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
department managers to be doing for
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
this this particular function has also
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
been working on um
 
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements across the
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
department i think john williams might
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
have discussed that with you last week
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh and now is we are going to embark on
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
our first
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
internal audit for the department which
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
is very exciting um partly in response
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
to a new hampshire hospital
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
recent new hampshire hospital audit so
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
we'll be working with new hampshire
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
hospital to determine what
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
is best for them to do an internal audit
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
um another major function of this unit
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
is coordination of lba audits
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that the um this kind of
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
the same as what financial compliance
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
unit is doing for single audits
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
this unit is doing for all of our lba
 
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.109 align:start position:0%
this unit is doing for all of our lba
audits

00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
audits
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
so there's an executive order i think
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's 20
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
20 1403 that requires us to do
 
00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
corrective action plans and then post on
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
transparent new hampshire
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up to our audit findings every
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
six months
 
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
well the department had been a little
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
bit remiss in doing that a little bit ad
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
hoc somewhere on some weren't on so
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
this person ensured that all of those
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
were on transparent new hampshire
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
and worked with the individual program
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
areas on corrective actions
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
and since we started i think we brought
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
down the number of outstanding findings
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
from like 63
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
down to just nine outstanding findings
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
and we're working to get those nine
 
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.150 align:start position:0%
and we're working to get those nine
remediated

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
remediated
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible that doesn't count
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
our three very recent lba audits but
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
all the all the prior ones are completed
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
so we have a slide on key
 
00:51:01.119 --> 00:51:02.150 align:start position:0%
so we have a slide on key
accomplishments

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
accomplishments
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to go over every single
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
one of these
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
they're here for you to to read and look
 
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:09.829 align:start position:0%
they're here for you to to read and look
at

00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
but i will i will just highlight the
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
we worked to establish data
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
interfaces these are specifically
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
related to medicaid
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we are as up to date
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
on medicaid beneficiaries so to do that
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
we had to create um these data
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
interfaces with the department of
 
00:51:34.839 --> 00:51:35.990 align:start position:0%
interfaces with the department of
corrections

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh vital records and department of
 
00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.190 align:start position:0%
uh vital records and department of
defense

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
defense
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
and and it's either a data interface or
 
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
a report that we receive and then we
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
take that information and we work very
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
closely with the bureau of family
 
00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.069 align:start position:0%
closely with the bureau of family
assistance

00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure that in as real time as
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
possible we're identifying what
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries are
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
or are not eligible for medicaid so
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
i know this sounds kind of simple and it
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
probably seems like something that
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
totally automated but i can assure you
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i highlight it here because it's
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
linked to
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
on my next slide what you'll see is one
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
of our key challenges
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
if we don't have real time
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
data and access to real-time data in a
 
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
in a
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
for which we need a lot of backup data
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
sharing agreements
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
and all kinds of hipaa compliance things
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
then we were really hindered in being
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
do our jobs as quickly as possible
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative yes
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
edwards so so i'm aware that on the doit
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
strategic plan somewhere along there
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
they have an eligibility system
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
upgrade or maybe it's an entire
 
00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.790 align:start position:0%
upgrade or maybe it's an entire
replacement

00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
are are you aware of that initiative
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
are you providing requirements
 
00:52:59.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
customer requirements on what you need
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
from that eligibility system
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of that particular upgrade
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
where we can we do work with the
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
eligibility system
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
management and say is this something we
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
can automate
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
we'd like to look at automating this
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
type of thing there's some that we can
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
and some that we can't but
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just focused on the new system for a
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
moment so
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
are you are you using uh the existing
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
system of the last decade or are you
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
using a relatively new eligibility
 
00:53:31.119 --> 00:53:32.390 align:start position:0%
using a relatively new eligibility
system

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
we it's the one system is new heights
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
is the the eligibility system for new
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire that's the the only system
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay you may want to make a note to
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
yourself to just dig into
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
the strategic plan around replacing that
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility system because it sounds to
 
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
me like
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of experience in these
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
feeder reports
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
figure out what kind of cross checks we
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
need to be doing
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
and in this new system that really ought
 
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
bought and configured to service you
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
if they're yes i very much appreciate
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
the feedback if there's a new
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
eligibility system in the works we would
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
definitely want to be able to
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
um have a lot of communication around
 
00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:20.950 align:start position:0%
um have a lot of communication around
that

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
in this area and in the other work that
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
um related to third third-party
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
liability and other things so
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the heads-up sure thank
 
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:35.109 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the heads-up sure thank
you

00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
key challenges so as i said data access
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
is really um
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
something we think about and talk about
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
and breathe
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
every day we need information to be
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
successful in our investigation work and
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
that means
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
access to data from different agencies
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
from municipalities from the counties
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
from federal databases
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to assimilate that
 
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.430 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to assimilate that
information

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
and compare it up against each other in
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
order to detect fraud it's the only way
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
we can do the work
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh technology so
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
software and contracts for for
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
technology necessary to
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
to do fraud detection and deterrence um
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
this is an area
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't have a budget ask
 
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
particularly to do any technology
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
enhancements but we did just
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
um get responses to a request for
 
00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:27.910 align:start position:0%
um get responses to a request for
information

00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
for a data analytics fraud detection
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
system and i think we got 25 responses
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
so we are in the process of sorting
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
through those and trying to get a sense
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
of what it would look like and what the
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
cost would be
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
but that's that's sort of an in-progress
 
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.069 align:start position:0%
but that's that's sort of an in-progress
uh

00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
item right now and recruitment
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
as i noted before it's it's um
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
really imperative that we find
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
highly skilled staff and managers and we
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
do have a pretty significant vacancy
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
rate in the bureau of program integrity
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
but um with the recent executive order
 
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
lifting hiring freeze we have
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
so that is the bureau of program
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
integrity oh you'll see the old name up
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
here because this was
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
prepared by finance so it says bureau of
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
improvement and integrity staffing but
 
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:20.630 align:start position:0%
improvement and integrity staffing but
it's

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
your program integrity and this is our
 
00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
79 35 64 positions
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
this is our budget comparison chart
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
you'll see we're now at about 50 50
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
so does it help receiving federal funds
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
by having an identified
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
structure to do these programs
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
yes the so the federal funds we receive
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
are because the work that we're doing is
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
actually federally required
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
for the program areas so um
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
medicaid for example we're required to
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
do third party liability
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
we're required to do program integrity
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
so they
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
fund our units the same way they fund
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
those i mean very very similar funding
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
i'll say it's about 50 50.
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
and this is just information about where
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
you can find the unit
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
in the budget book and on the budget
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
in the in your budget briefing book and
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
the budget book itself
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
so chair this is where i would ask do
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
you so
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
there are two accounting units related
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
to meredith bureau this one and then
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
another one but she's about to go over
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
that second bureau now
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
do you want to wait to look at both
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
accounting units at the end of her
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
total presentation or do you want to
 
00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
look at this one now and look at the
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
other one later
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
so she just finished a presentation if
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
one set of accounts that address
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
or consistent with what she just did
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
let's do them now
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
it's top to bottom and then if there's a
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
second presentation we'll look at the
 
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
second set of accounts with that okay
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
so meredith if you want to stop sharing
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'll go ahead and share the
 
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:18.470 align:start position:0%
i'll go ahead and share the
okay

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question about her last
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
comment before we go to the numbers
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
um you're recognized
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
you mentioned your head count was 64.
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
but the budget shows
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
69 or 68. is it is there a reason that
 
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
there's a discrepancy there
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not 100 sure um
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
position count from finance as well the
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
only thing i can think
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
is that one of them might have been
 
00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.190 align:start position:0%
is that one of them might have been
somewhat

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
um delayed and counting
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
a handful of positions i would have
 
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
expected it to be about six or seven
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
so it's not as many as i would have
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
thought but a handful of positions that
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium doing the function
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
of parental reimbursement
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
so that was parental reimbursement to
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
dcyf and that
 
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
function was discontinued and so we no
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
longer have those positions
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay but they're budgeted for the next
 
00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:22.549 align:start position:0%
okay but they're budgeted for the next
biennium

00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
i believe those are the numbers i
 
00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
believe the positions exist but they're
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
not funded
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
so as i'm looking at well jumping ahead
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
i'll let you
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative edward representative
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
walder also has her hand raised
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm i'm i'm back about three or
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
four pages into the
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
yeah you're right i'm sorry i didn't see
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
you sooner i
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
i'm like playing with my spreadsheet too
 
00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.750 align:start position:0%
i'm like playing with my spreadsheet too
so

00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
please go ahead well it i think
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
maybe we've stumbled upon that answer
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
um before i got recognized but
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
so you meredith you have a 25
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate right now
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
out of the 64 positions
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
yeah right can you tell me what kinds of
 
01:00:25.359 --> 01:00:25.910 align:start position:0%
yeah right can you tell me what kinds of
people

01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
who are you what kinds of positions are
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
these and how difficult
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.079 --> 01:00:37.589 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
some of the work that we do is very
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
trainable i mean all all work is
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
trainable to some degree right but
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
i think i think that um you know the
 
01:00:47.359 --> 01:00:47.829 align:start position:0%
i think i think that um you know the
work

01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
in um special investigations unit
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
for example we can train people to be
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
investigators i mean if they if they
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
sort of come with some skills and some
 
01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.750 align:start position:0%
sort of come with some skills and some
understanding

01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
it helps if they have understanding of
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
program area but we can sort of train
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
them into that
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
but there are other other things like
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
um third party liability for example
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
where we need people
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
who can manage
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
a contract with a massive
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
managed care organization and hold
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
that managed care organization
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
accountable to all of our contract
 
01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.549 align:start position:0%
accountable to all of our contract
requirements

01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
and everything that we intend to see
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
them doing um
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
within the contract and understand what
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
it is that
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
we expect in third-party liability it's
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's a sophisticated skill set
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
and it is not someone needs to come with
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
a certain degree of skills that we
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily train them into um
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
so it really it really depends on the
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
function i guess unfortunately is my
 
01:01:54.079 --> 01:01:55.029 align:start position:0%
function i guess unfortunately is my
answer

01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
but um in some places it's
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's possible to you know post the
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
position and you you get applicants who
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
are gonna
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
fit that without a problem and in some
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
areas it's actually
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
it's actually more challenging
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
so i guess one question i would have and
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
i think this
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
this is a question i have throughout
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
sort of throughout the budget
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
and when we know that we're you know
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
we're 20 to 25 percent
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
um our our way our um
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
workforce is down 20 to 25 percent
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
our are our wages in this area i mean
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
you just talked about these are pretty
 
01:02:42.549 --> 01:02:42.559 align:start position:0%
specialized people
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
are wages in this area competitive with
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
i assume it would be private
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
private industry that we would be
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
competing with
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
are we in within a competitive area
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
i don't um
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know because i don't know what
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
the wages
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
are in every instance in a competitive
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
private area so i i can't really answer
 
01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.829 align:start position:0%
private area so i i can't really answer
that

01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh i can't confirm or deny
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representative walner but
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
i can say that
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
um in a couple instances we have just
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
now the hiring phrase
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
um freeze was lifted we posted a few
 
01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.670 align:start position:0%
um freeze was lifted we posted a few
positions

01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
and we received very few applicants
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
very few applicants um
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
so that's the you know it's it's
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
concerning to me
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
certainly and you have to think that
 
01:03:41.599 --> 01:03:42.549 align:start position:0%
certainly and you have to think that
wages

01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
wages
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
no that that was a couple of pages back
 
01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:51.589 align:start position:0%
no that that was a couple of pages back
but

01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
anyway let's go forward and what what is
 
01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
the number of the page that we're going
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
to now
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
in the budget on the spreadsheet
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
line item 13 750
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
we're on the um this teal highlight if
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
you will the first accounting unit that
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
meredith just reviewed was 79.35
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
which is on page 1168.
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
so so you were asking questions in the
 
01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:24.630 align:start position:0%
so so you were asking questions in the
area

01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
i almost asked the question and that is
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
i assume that of the people who have
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
left you said i think you said something
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
like seven people left
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
and you had almost a complete turnover
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
except for one person
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
are you doing what are you finding from
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
your exit interview process
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
what are they telling you about why
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're leaving
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
that's a great question i'm not sure i
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
can answer why the one person didn't
 
01:04:55.119 --> 01:04:55.430 align:start position:0%
can answer why the one person didn't
leave

01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
leave
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
tasha you may have some some insight
 
01:04:58.079 --> 01:04:59.270 align:start position:0%
tasha you may have some some insight
there

01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
obviously i want to focus on the exit
 
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.349 align:start position:0%
obviously i want to focus on the exit
interview

01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
interview
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
yep no um in the case of three of them
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
they retired so
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
they left government services service
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
the other um ones that left or a couple
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
that left
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
went for advancement in other areas
 
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.589 align:start position:0%
went for advancement in other areas
because

01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
the investigative unit is very limited
 
01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:22.870 align:start position:0%
the investigative unit is very limited
in

01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
its upward mobility it's from
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
investigator we try to put in some
 
01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:27.349 align:start position:0%
investigator we try to put in some
layers

01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
layers
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
but it's investigator to a supervisor to
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
an administrator so there's not
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
as wide of an advancement as it would be
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
he's got us talked about
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
yes three retired and three needed uh
 
01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.510 align:start position:0%
yes three retired and three needed uh
promotion

01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
promotion
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
great um so accounting unit 7935
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
starts at the bottom of page 1168 and
 
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
goes on to page
 
01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:17.349 align:start position:0%
goes on to page
1169

01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
question yes uh yes sir
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
why aren't we seeing these reductions
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
from the hiring freeze
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
in the adjusted authorized lines for
 
01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.270 align:start position:0%
in the adjusted authorized lines for
class

01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
class
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
10. it doesn't the hiring freeze doesn't
 
01:06:41.839 --> 01:06:42.470 align:start position:0%
10. it doesn't the hiring freeze doesn't
reduce

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
the um the appropriation it
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
increases the lapse for the year
 
01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
so the budget remains the same under a
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze there there hasn't been a
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
reduction in the
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
so it'll show up in the lapse but it
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up on the
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized at this point
 
01:07:00.799 --> 01:07:02.150 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized at this point
correct

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you so to follow up on that does
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
that mean
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
that the fy 22 governor's recommendation
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
is budgeting part of the lapse since
 
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's significantly lower
 
01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
than the fy21
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
because of those retirements um this is
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
one of those things we spoke to
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
last week when often when people retire
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
they're at the very top of the pay scale
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
and when a position is vacant
 
01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
it is budgeted at the very bottom of the
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
pay scale so
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
other than a one position change
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
um and there may be some unfunded
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
positions in this area as well
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
that may be affecting that number but
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
probably the largest effect are those
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
were retirements and those now being
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
budgeted at the bottom of the pay scale
 
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
all right so you're still budgeting for
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
the same number of ftes you're just
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
assuming a different average
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
salary i believe so yes
 
01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.589 align:start position:0%
salary i believe so yes
okay

01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
all right so this this this budget is
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
really all about the people there's not
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
of other money going on here
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
that's correct you see it's the
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
positions and benefits lines
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
why is no rent uh budgeted
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
beth where would the um
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
the cost for where these people sit be
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
budgeted is that
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
in the larger open budget
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
um the copiers used to be in this line
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
and they're now paid for out of outcome
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
all right well does anyone have any
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
questions about these line items
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
because i i do not i just have one it
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
kind of applies to other places i think
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
i've seen this the fringe benefits it
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
looks like they're up
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
like i think 25 percent between this
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
planning and next
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
but i don't see a con a matching amount
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
going up in the in the salaries i'm just
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
wondering why would there be a
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
why would there be a difference there a
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
percentage difference
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
so the fringe benefits are set by
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
um so that and they tell us what those
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
numbers have to be budgeted at
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
so we don't i'm not i can
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
get from you from department of
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
administrative services how they tell us
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
we have to calculate that if you'd like
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
oh so that's not like social security
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff fringe benefit
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
insurance that sort of thing something
 
01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.309 align:start position:0%
insurance that sort of thing something
else

01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
um right those types of things would be
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
included in class 60 benefits
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
i believe fringe benefits is something
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
else oh okay okay
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
that's i'm just curious what it is
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's all thanks i'll get that
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay if there's no other questions i'm
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
going to go ahead and stop sharing and
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
turn it back on i do have my i have
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
my hand up i hope go ahead sorry mr

representative
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah so um i wondered
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
either meredith or um karen if you could
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
is this budget
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
what you requested of the governor
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
is this the agency are you meeting the
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
agency request here
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
and if you aren't what are the other
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
what's missing and um did you have
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
any um additional requests that you were
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
i don't believe there are any
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
did we not have prioritized needs did we
 
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.350 align:start position:0%
did we not have prioritized needs did we
unfund

01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
unfund
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
any of your positions from the agency
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
phase to the governor's space
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so with the exception of
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the parental
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement unit
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
karen there's six unfunded positions in
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
the governor's face
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
that's family yep and beth
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna have to work with you and i i
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
apologize to the committee
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
um it looks like our our what we have
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
for our pie charts
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
on slide 15 don't match what's in
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
the budget here and i'm i'm not sure why
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
um when i looked at them just now i
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
thought that's really high that's not my
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
budget it's not that high
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
but um i'm not sure what that
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
is so we'll get your new pie charts
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
we'll get new pie charts
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
yep they don't quite match
 
01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
so back to representative
 
01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:42.310 align:start position:0%
so back to representative
[Music]

01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
one of the slides that you had been
 
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
providing last week was the
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
slide to just give us a quick overview
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
of what you do with more money what you
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
do with less
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
that wasn't in miss tulsa tell us
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
slide deck is is is that coming in the
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
next slide deck
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
it i apologize uh mr chair it's in
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
if on behalf of the division so i have
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
it later in the presentation
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
as opposed to for each of the bureaus
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
yeah now that that it's the the reason
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
for that question is to
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
anticipate representative walner and
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
others wanting to just know
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
um what a change in in these
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
budget requests would do to you so
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
yep and i can go over that by division
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
and if we need to split it up by bureau
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
i can do that too
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
all right i'll i'll defer to uh mr
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
ripple and
 
01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
um and the minister hands on how to
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much so
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
all right meredith back to you on the
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
second part of your presentation okay
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
and now we will be
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay this is where we left off i believe
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
discussing the bureau of program quality
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
so bureau of program
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
i just i want to have the spreadsheet up
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
at the same time could you go to your
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
last slide so i know which
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
fund we're going to be talking about
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
um page 1168 looks like
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 79.35
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
we just finished that didn't we
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
oh i apologize um so and you want to
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
program quality and you're talking about
 
01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.350 align:start position:0%
program quality and you're talking about
dpq

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
dpq
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
and that is i'm going gonna have to go
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
to the end i apologize but i can find it
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
getting a preview of all the slides
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
chair do you want to wait to look at the
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
other accounting unit until she presents
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
on the area
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
i do but i want to she's doing the
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
slides i
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
i want to be looking at the spreadsheet
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's accounting unit 66.37
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
and i can find the page for you the page
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
is 11.82
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
now we'll go backwards through the
 
01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.990 align:start position:0%
now we'll go backwards through the
slides

01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
slides
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
so bureau of program quality uh
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
has four individual units
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
and each of those is is
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
functions either one or a combination of
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
functions that are really
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
designed to assist the bureau
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
sorry the department the whole
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
department in meeting
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
its overall objective to improve the
 
01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.550 align:start position:0%
its overall objective to improve the
design

01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
design
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
and the quality and the effectiveness of
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
our services
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
so when you think of the bureau of
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
program quality
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
you can think um data
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
data there's a lot a lot of focus
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
on data and getting our hands on the
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
right data and using the data to tell
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
the story
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
of um how much did we provide for
 
01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.950 align:start position:0%
of um how much did we provide for
services

01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
how well did we provide it and was
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
anyone better off
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
so um really looking at program quality
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
by evaluating the data
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
and the data integrity first and then
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
conducting the data analysis to see what
 
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
the data is telling us
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
so i'll go into each of the four
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
functions kind of in more detail
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
starting with our data analytics and
 
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
reporting unit
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
so all of our units are important
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
but only data analytics and reporting
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
got two slides
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
because they are doing a lot of the
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
heavy lift lifting as far as data
 
01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:03.990 align:start position:0%
heavy lift lifting as far as data
management

01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
and reporting so just to
 
01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
to give you a sense we get data from a
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
host of places and in fact this unit
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
i'll go to the next slide for a second
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
if you can see at the bottom here data
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
systems oversight
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
this unit actually manages a handful of
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
data systems itself um but generally you
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
know we get data from a host of places
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
through our department billing systems
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
from national metrics from surveys and
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
audits that we do
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
ourselves and then we evaluate
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
that data for accuracy and have to make
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
sure there
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
aren't conflating factors and then
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
analyze the data for the program or we
 
01:16:47.189 --> 01:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
help the program analyze the data
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
or we work with external vendors that
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
might have been retained
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
to do to do performance analysis for us
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
um so a couple of the key functions
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
you'll see here for example
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
are data analytics and reporting works
 
01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.950 align:start position:0%
are data analytics and reporting works
on

01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
our behavioral health analytics so that
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
we can do monitoring and analysis of
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
some of the metrics that are required
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
for the state's mental health settlement
 
01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.189 align:start position:0%
for the state's mental health settlement
agreement

01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
just to give you a flavor of some of the
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
ad hoc reporting that they do what
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
they're really famous for
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
at least around here is when people need
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
to know something
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
about their population about like
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
demographics or claims or
 
01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know services maybe some kind of
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
ratio like what percentage of people
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
um got this service this way or
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
or um what's the trend in this area
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
you come to data analytics and reporting
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
so for example myself
 
01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
on behalf of another program i needed to
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
know about
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
ob services so new hampshire is a very
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
rural state and that impacts how people
 
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:54.630 align:start position:0%
rural state and that impacts how people
access

01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
services so i worked with data analytics
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
and reporting to say how would i figure
 
01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.270 align:start position:0%
and reporting to say how would i figure
out

01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
where people are getting their prenatal
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
their labor and delivery and their
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
postnatal care and data analytics and
 
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
reporting is doing that
 
01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
analysis for me and then figuring out
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
how to show it to me
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
in a way that is that is digestible
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
um another major function of this unit
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
is you'll see
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
at the top of the slide here are
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
medicaid quality monitoring
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
so this uh unit is managing our medicaid
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
quality information systems
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
publicly facing website you can
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
if you haven't yet i encourage you to
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
visit the website
 
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
and they are managing 7 000
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
individual data points i just found this
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
out last week it's
 
01:18:53.669 --> 01:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
the incredible which get rolled into 200
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
individual measures and those are used
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
to measure the quality of our managed
 
01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:00.390 align:start position:0%
to measure the quality of our managed
care

01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
organizations so
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
this one in particular you can see it's
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
just an example but this is emergency
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
department visits
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
that are potentially treatable in
 
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
primary care
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
and if you were to be on the website
 
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
with this one you could
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
click on this blue line
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
and it would break out into three
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
individual lines
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
showing you the track record of each of
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
our individual managed care
 
01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.350 align:start position:0%
our individual managed care
organizations

01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
and this this this example in particular
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
i noticed just the other day if you look
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
at q2
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
of 2020 you can look at the difference
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
between q1 and q2 of 2020
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
you can see the impact of covid
 
01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
happening right there
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
so that's i find that very interesting
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of a data geek
 
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
so you can see the the reduction in
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
emergency room visits
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
right there and then the next slide
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
i wanted to show you is another sort of
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
critical component of what
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
this is work that we're doing on the
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
development of um
 
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
an enterprise business intelligence
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis dashboard so you can see
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
draft written this is just
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
this is in practice it's in development
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
it's not out yet it's not publicly
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
facing but
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
um this is work that we are doing
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
to identify map metrics and this was
 
01:20:30.239 --> 01:20:30.550 align:start position:0%
to identify map metrics and this was
done

01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with another one of our
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
our bureau units our substance misuse
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
planning and evaluation
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
unit to really identify
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
the measures that matter related to the
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
and the work that this unit um
 
01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
our data analytics and reporting is
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
engaged in it's sort of represented here
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
is they're working to standardize
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
department data and standardize
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
data presentation so step
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
one is really picking the right data
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
to tell a story and there's kind of a
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
science behind
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
that knowing what metrics matter and
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
what metrics
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
don't matter or are proxies are too far
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
away to really be important
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
so getting that data standardization
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
across all of our individual program
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
areas in the department
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
is really important so that people like
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
you can see it
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
and know uh what they're looking at is
 
01:21:28.159 --> 01:21:29.110 align:start position:0%
and know uh what they're looking at is
relevant

01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
and one of the one of the things we've
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
been discussing is is
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
moving towards certain frameworks of
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
telling stories so for example using
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
social determinants of health
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
um would be a way that if we can kind of
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
gear all of our data that direction
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
then we can start looking at outcomes
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
across our whole populations as opposed
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
to in
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
individual program areas
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
so the second piece um that this unit is
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
moving towards
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
is data visualization and that is
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
is its own very specialized science but
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
developing our skills and data data
 
01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:07.990 align:start position:0%
developing our skills and data data
visualization

01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
visualization
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
is really really important as we move
 
01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.110 align:start position:0%
is really really important as we move
towards

01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
towards
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
better use of dashboards to manage our
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
programs and
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
to provide to you guys policymakers um
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
to help make
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
policy decisions so so those are kind of
 
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:22.950 align:start position:0%
policy decisions so so those are kind of
two

01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
mr chair yeah so so i love visual
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
information i'm just curious about
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
where the personnel are coming from that
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
are sort of the visual information
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
experts on getting the data and
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
creating the graph or are they coming
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
from the is department are they
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
organic to this bureau so
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
this was a partnership between the
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
bureau of information systems
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
and our unit and i think the the
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
division of public health they were all
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
working together on this i'm not sure if
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
anyone was more responsible for data
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
visualization than any other
 
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
susan do you know better who was working
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
so you're accurate meredith it was those
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
departments so
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
those other divisions it was public
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
health along with our
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
bis and data analytics and reporting and
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
then they also were working with a
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
contractor as well
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
i believe it was deloitte right thank
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
you yeah
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
but to get to the to the um
 
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
to your point mr chair the
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
data visualization skill set
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
is not one that we have um clearly
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
identified within the department
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's one that i would like to develop
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
within our division however so that
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
because we sort of um partner with all
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
of the areas
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
in in their data management i'd like to
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
also be able to offer the visualization
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
piece as well
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
but we don't we don't have anyone
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
clearly identified to do that at this
 
01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:55.110 align:start position:0%
clearly identified to do that at this
time

01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
luckily we have a lot of smart people
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
who can do it without trying too hard
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
but like i said it's it's a science in
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
and of itself and it's a skill that can
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
be developed
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
right so that would just make me wonder
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
if it belongs in the is group or in your
 
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:08.709 align:start position:0%
if it belongs in the is group or in your
group

01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
but you'll figure that out yes and i
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
i don't um i think dave readers is
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
um call um
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
he is probably yes he's
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay writing me as we speak um but uh
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
yes we can certainly have that
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
i would um so
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
so far we're leveraging deloitte our our
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
external vendor as the data
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
visualization leads
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
yeah in the future i think it's a skill
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
we should be able to have internally as
 
01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:45.830 align:start position:0%
we should be able to have internally as
well

01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important skill and
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
and i would have this conversation with
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
dave but personally i think it belongs
 
01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:51.590 align:start position:0%
dave but personally i think it belongs
more

01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
in our bureau um i think that because
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
you know we're really doing the data
 
01:24:56.159 --> 01:24:57.510 align:start position:0%
you know we're really doing the data
determination

01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh he's agreeing he's agreeing he's just
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
texted he agrees
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
so i mean you know that's because it's
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
really managing the
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
systems and how the systems are speaking
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
to each other and we partner with them
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
on this we wouldn't do anything in a
 
01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.470 align:start position:0%
on this we wouldn't do anything in a
vacuum

01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
vacuum
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
but um i do think i do think it's just
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's a highly scheduled a highly
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
specialized skill
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
to be able to create a dashboard that
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
people can see
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
and in real time use to manage things
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
and that kind of is linked closer to the
 
01:25:25.679 --> 01:25:26.070 align:start position:0%
and that kind of is linked closer to the
data

01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
science than it is to the is science
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
so our medicaid quality program
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
so they are responsible for um
 
01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
our medicaid quality strategy which is a
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
federal requirement
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh as cms requires that anyone who
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
engages in managed care
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
as a as a medicaid management strategy
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
we have to tell them in writing once
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
every three years
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
how we are going to measure the health
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
of our population that's
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's covered in managed care so the
 
01:25:59.360 --> 01:25:59.990 align:start position:0%
that's covered in managed care so the
200

01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
200
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
measures that i was referring to before
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
this area
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
takes those then from our from our data
 
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
analytics and reporting
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
and works with the individual program
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
areas to identify genuine
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
issues so any trends or outliers that
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
aren't going in the right direction
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
and in addition to those 200 measures
 
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
they also review another 50 different
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
tables and reports
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
for the same thing they'll work with
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
program areas to highlight things where
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
they say this isn't going the way you
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
want it to
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
um the program area may determine
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
they're not satisfied
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
with the mcos performance and then that
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
would trigger a conversation with henry
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
littman our medicaid director
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
and probably a kind of a frank
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
conversation with
 
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
the managed care entity to get it
 
01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.790 align:start position:0%
the managed care entity to get it
remedied

01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
remedied
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
um this unit also manages our let me
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
just see if i have no okay
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
um also manages our external
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
quality review organization eqro
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
external quality review
 
01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
organization which is also a cms
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
requirement that we have that
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
um and that vendor
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
manages the quality of our encounter
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
data which is like the
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
individual claims data that's coming in
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
from the mcos
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
um they help to do oversight of the
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
specific performance improvement plans
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
each of our mcos has to have a handful
 
01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
of performance improvement projects that
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
they're working on every year
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
and this area is is the eqro is kind of
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
managing those in this area there's
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
oversight of that
 
01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
and we've also identified 10
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
key um
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
areas of performance measures that we're
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
going to focus on with the mcos
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
this year i can't remember for updating
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
those annually
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
um susan the 10 performance indicators
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
we have that are related to
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
um access and timeliness and
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
and beneficiary experience are those
 
01:27:59.440 --> 01:27:59.990 align:start position:0%
and beneficiary experience are those
annually

01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
annually
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
updated no so it's part of the the
 
01:28:02.639 --> 01:28:03.270 align:start position:0%
updated no so it's part of the the
three-year

01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
three-year
 
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
quality strategy okay okay so those are
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
every three years
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
so those ten indicators are things that
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
we've chosen to focus on are things like
 
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
um adolescent vaccinations
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
certain screenings for women um
 
01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
adherence to antipsychotic medications
 
01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:19.750 align:start position:0%
adherence to antipsychotic medications
it's

01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
ten very specific areas that new
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire chose to really
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
focus on and drill into uh yes chair
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
this question
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
so so i just want to understand when you
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
say uh
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has chosen these metrics
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
there are things like
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
organizations like ncqa promulgating
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's hedis h-e-d-i-s
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure are you are you really
 
01:28:44.159 --> 01:28:45.990 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure are you are you really
leveraging

01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
leveraging
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
national standards programs for quality
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
as opposed to going on your own and
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
sort of creating your own metrics we do
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
utilize hedis measures for uh our
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
comparators and i i i can't remember
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head susan i might be
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
able to see this
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
um whether all 10 of these fall
 
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
into hedis metrics or not
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
um it's all but
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
one okay is either um part of hedis or
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's part of the core set the cms core
 
01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
set of measures
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
and then and then what's the one outlier
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
right not specifically but why
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
is there an outlier is it because he
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
just didn't match
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
and so we had to make up our own metric
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
no so
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
it what we did is we looked at what the
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
lowest performing measures were
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
that could have the best impact on the
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
health of this population
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
and we also worked with the division of
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
medicaid services to tie these
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
into their their apms
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
so their alternative payment methods as
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
well as the withhold and incentive
 
01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.910 align:start position:0%
well as the withhold and incentive
program

01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler has a question
 
01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:06.629 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler has a question
yes

01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so much of this deals
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
with i.t
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
and normally when we look at a budget we
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
see uh
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
that they have um you know
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
a tie with the with i.t
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
and that they have have given them some
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
money from their budget and
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
and i look at things like going to
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
deloitte for
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
information that we may have in-house in
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
our own i.t
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
section i wonder how much you are
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
working with i.t
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so we work
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
very closely with bureau of information
 
01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.070 align:start position:0%
very closely with bureau of information
systems

01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
and much of our
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
data um is stored in a in a
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
variety of different systems really but
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of it is
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
medicaid related and so that would be
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
the mmis system
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
um and that would actually be in the
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
mmis sorry in the medicaid
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
budget in particular um
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
some of the other data that we're
 
01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:09.110 align:start position:0%
some of the other data that we're
getting

01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative is actually subscriptions
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
to data sets so those
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
come into the department in the form of
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
certain reports we might be able to get
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
into someone's external data system and
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
then we have access to their
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
data but it's not necessarily a system
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
that we own but something that we can
 
01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:31.430 align:start position:0%
that we own but something that we can
access

01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so yeah i'm not sure if that
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
answers your question but it's
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's uh there there aren't um
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
there are some systems that the
 
01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.110 align:start position:0%
there are some systems that the
department

01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
owns outright i think the phoenix system
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
falls into that category the width sys
 
01:31:53.110 --> 01:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
which is one that we manage
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
um the wit system that we we
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
own or manage your lease in one way or
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
another um
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
but not not this
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
bureau in isolation it's work that we're
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
doing on behalf of other bureaus
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
give me one more thing the um
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
acronym you and the chairman were
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
talking was it
 
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:22.709 align:start position:0%
 
h-e-d-i-s

01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's it stands for health care
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
effectiveness data and
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
information set okay it's in my list of
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
acronyms somewhere hopefully
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you representative
 
01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions i was missing so to
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative weiler's
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
question a little deeper uh as i look at
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
at the budget for uh qai
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
operations i don't see transfers to
 
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
is um and even how dependent you are i'm
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
just wondering
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
do they just budget completely
 
01:33:04.719 --> 01:33:05.990 align:start position:0%
do they just budget completely
separately

01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
separately
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
from you and you rely on their services
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
in a team-oriented way where you each
 
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
pay your own freight or
 
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
or you uh how how is the
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
i i guess i can wait on the answer i'm
 
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:20.550 align:start position:0%
i i guess i can wait on the answer i'm
just

01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what the money flow
 
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
is to keep
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
an integrated team there in dhhs
 
01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
meredith i can jump in there if you'd
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
like okay thanks um
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
so the bureau of information services
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
which you'll hear from after lunch today
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
which is headed by dave weeders he
 
01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.790 align:start position:0%
which is headed by dave weeders he
oversees

01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
oversees
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
the technology for the department in
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
coordination with the department of
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
information technology
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
so rather than budgeting
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
what we would call class 20 27 is the
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
transfer to doit i believe
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
rather than budgeting that in each of
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
the different areas of the department we
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
budgeted in one place
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
in the bureau of information services
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
budget so you will see that this
 
01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:05.270 align:start position:0%
budget so you will see that this
afternoon

01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
resented walner has her hand up
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
i think that it's the same answer that
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
karen just gave it
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
for instance the deloitte the contract
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
with deloitte
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
um would be in information where would i
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
see that
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
so we do as meredith was mentioning have
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
a few pieces of technology
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
that are budgeted within the divisions
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
that manage them
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
so most of the deloitte contract is
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
actually budgeted within
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
the division of economic and housing
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
stability which you'll hear from
 
01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:43.270 align:start position:0%
stability which you'll hear from
tomorrow

01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
in the new heights system mmis is also
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
budgeted separately in the medicaid
 
01:34:48.719 --> 01:34:49.669 align:start position:0%
budgeted separately in the medicaid
budget

01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
um so some of those larger systems are
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
accounted for separately
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
but are our transfers to doit are within
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
um the bis budget
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to show everyone um
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
one of the products that's being made by
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
the medicaid quality
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
unit this is sort of a healthcare
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
scorecard of sorts to help
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
enrollees determine a managed care plan
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
and this is actually it's actually a
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
two-pager but you can just see here some
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
of the metrics
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
that you can reach from the from the url
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
up at the top
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
um and um mira health caritas is our
 
01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:35.350 align:start position:0%
um and um mira health caritas is our
newest

01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
newest
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
mco so that's not reflected here but it
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
shows well sense compared to new
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire healthy families
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
so that people can kind of look at these
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
metrics compared to national medicaid
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
and help them determine their own
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
our unit of substance misuse planning
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
and evaluation
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
so this unit really
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
works with a number of different
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
partners and is engaged
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
to help identify the kind of metrics we
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
would use
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
for program evaluation and outcomes in
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
the subsphere
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder sphere so
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
those are partners like um the division
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
of public health
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh chief medical examiner chief chief
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
medical examiner's office
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
um our bureau of emergency services our
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
bureau of drug and alcohol services
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission so all kinds
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
of internal and external partners
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
and looking to identify the indicators
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
that tell us
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know how many services were provided
 
01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:39.270 align:start position:0%
you know how many services were provided
how

01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
well was that done and is anyone better
 
01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:42.470 align:start position:0%
well was that done and is anyone better
off

01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
so it's the kind of outcomes you would
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
probably think of in the sun sphere is
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
there a reduction in er visits
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
are people housed are they working are
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
families united
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
um are people employed
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
but those are those are kind of um you
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
might think of those in terms of end of
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
the spectrum like through treatment and
 
01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.310 align:start position:0%
the spectrum like through treatment and
recovery

01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
this unit is engaged in identifying um
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
indicators and performance metrics
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
through the through the whole spectrum
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
all the way into the prevention area so
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
even in like predictive analytics kind
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
of area
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
thinking about what are the sorts of
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
indicators that can tell us
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
um in advance what are the components
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
that sort of predispose someone for
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
being at higher risk of substance misuse
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
or abuse
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
so this unit is really you know like i
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
said partnering with a lot of areas they
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
worked on that
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
enterprise business intelligence
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
dashboard i was referencing earlier
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
sorry uh so represent walnut your hand
 
01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
is up is that from a previous question
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
so so one of my general concerns the
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
last couple of terms
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
is it just seems to me like
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
there's this endless flow of money
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's going into
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
drug treatment and so i keep wondering
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
are we doing enough on the prevention
 
01:38:23.679 --> 01:38:24.950 align:start position:0%
are we doing enough on the prevention
side

01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
is this the is this the bureau with the
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
with the smart people thinking about
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
what's causing people
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
to begin their substance misuse and and
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
what we can do to interdict them before
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
they get started down this bad road
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
i can tell you from my recent
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
conversations with joe harding
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
who leads this unit yes he is absolutely
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
thinking about this
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
but i i think that susan i can see her
 
01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
face i think she has something she'd
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
like to
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
chime in
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
so the the subject matter experts in
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
prevention come out of the bureau of
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol services and you'll be
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
hearing from them
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
later on i believe it's this week but we
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
we partner with them in providing them
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
data to help understand prevalence
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
and consequence of substance misuse to
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
help them
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
identify regions areas gaps and services
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
to really target
 
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
prevention services upstream
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so this unit is is
 
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
trying to define the indicators and
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
identify the data that will
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
appropriately inform the policy on
 
01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:40.470 align:start position:0%
appropriately inform the policy on
effectiveness

01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
effectiveness
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
of all of the practices for substance
 
01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:45.590 align:start position:0%
of all of the practices for substance
misuse

01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying anything thank you okay
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
and our health services assessment unit
 
01:39:58.159 --> 01:40:01.109 align:start position:0%
and our health services assessment unit
so

01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
they kind of kind of gonna split them
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
into two major functions
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
one is the first you see here sentinel
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
event reporting
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
they are responsible for intake
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
of sentinel event reports and then
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
reviewing those carefully to see whether
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
it does meet our definition of sentinel
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
event and then running the review
 
01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:29.350 align:start position:0%
event and then running the review
process

01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
and then the other major function of the
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
health services assessment is doing
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
external quality reviews of our
 
01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:37.830 align:start position:0%
external quality reviews of our
providers

01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
and you'll see here um the the provided
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
some of the providers listed
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh case management agencies on behalf of
 
01:40:44.719 --> 01:40:45.270 align:start position:0%
uh case management agencies on behalf of
the

01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:47.590 --> 01:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
bureau of elderly and adult services and
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
for the bureau of mental health services
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
quality service reviews for attend
 
01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
mental health centers
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
and then also redesignation of our six
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
psychiatric inpatient facilities or or
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
drfs designated receiving facilities
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
so the health services assessment you
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
know it's not that
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh individual program areas aren't doing
 
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
reviews of their own
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
providers because they are and they do
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
but what distinguishes health services
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
assessment our
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
our group is really the rigor with which
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
we design
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
the reviews so we're creating tools it
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
might be a it might be a survey
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
it might be an interview template um
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
it's clinical records reviews that are
 
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
very rigorous in nature
 
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
and allow you to compare provider to
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
provider and compare providers across
 
01:41:39.119 --> 01:41:40.070 align:start position:0%
provider and compare providers across
time

01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what distinguishes these
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
reviews they're they're pretty intense
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
and very well developed
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair so so if i wanted to know
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
how many nursing home beds we have in
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire right now
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
and how many we think we're going to
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
need in 10 years
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
would this bureau of elderly and adult
 
01:42:02.719 --> 01:42:03.830 align:start position:0%
would this bureau of elderly and adult
services

01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
be the responsible agency to answer that
 
01:42:06.239 --> 01:42:07.189 align:start position:0%
be the responsible agency to answer that
question

01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
yes they would and do they do active
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
10-year planning because when i talk to
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
the good folks at rockingham county
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
they aren't looking at a 10-year plan
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
i've asked the former
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
director a couple of times we just spent
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
a bunch of money on renovating
 
01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
places it's beautiful but he has no
 
01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:28.950 align:start position:0%
places it's beautiful but he has no
projected

01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
projected
 
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh bed count requirement in the out year
 
01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.310 align:start position:0%
uh bed count requirement in the out year
so

01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
so who how how much real planning is
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
taking place
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
so i will tell you we do have a
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
requirement um it's relatively recent we
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
have only submitted
 
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
one report so far for 10-year a 10-year
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
demographics um
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
report and i'm trying to think of the
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
exact populations it hits i believe it's
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's medicaid population
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
and then i think the dltss populations
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
which would be
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
our our waiver populations so dd
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
um cfi
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
and then also nursing homes i think
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
those i'm going to put it in those four
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
categories where um we were required to
 
01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:16.070 align:start position:0%
categories where um we were required to
submit

01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
submit
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
a report to the committee i believe
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
committee on um 10-year
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
demographics changes uh
 
01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
i would have to look at it and i can get
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
you that report
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this was pre-covered so at
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
it is a little bit outdated and it's a
 
01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:37.430 align:start position:0%
it is a little bit outdated and it's a
bi

01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
bi
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
annual report so i think our next
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
submission would be this coming
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
fall well i'm happy to hear you're doing
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
it i'm just surprised that the
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
disconnect with the rockingham county
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
nursing home not knowing
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to believe it i just
 
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
i just i'm glad to hear that somebody's
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
thinking 10 years out
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
and it would be really great if the
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
people involved at the county level
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
knew what the what the statewide
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
thinking was
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
that no that's a a truly a great point
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
um it like i said it's a relatively new
 
01:44:15.119 --> 01:44:15.910 align:start position:0%
um it like i said it's a relatively new
process

01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
something we're looking to develop and i
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
think that the uh
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
requirements of the legislation mandated
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
that we were going to do the review
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with um employment
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
security so in the first iteration we
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
were really just focused on figuring out
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
what data we were going to use and and
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
um because data
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
um employment security of course has
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
elmi so we were
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
trying to utilize their information but
 
01:44:41.669 --> 01:44:41.679 align:start position:0%
looping in the counties
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
at that level uh for the nursing home
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
portion of the demographic projections
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense right
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely so i will just
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
note a email that came through
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
recently um into my inbox related to
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
health services assessment
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
um kind of summed up for me what this
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
bureau the bureau of program quality
 
01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:07.510 align:start position:0%
bureau the bureau of program quality
does

01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
pretty nicely they were working with i
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
think it was elderly and adult services
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
on this one in particular and
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
other involved services had a question
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
on uh something they were seeing
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
in their data and once we
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh health services assessment drilled in
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
they realized that the way the data was
 
01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:25.430 align:start position:0%
they realized that the way the data was
measured

01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
measured
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
had changed to make it more reliable to
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
make it so that one person and another
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
person looking at the same thing were
 
01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:31.270 align:start position:0%
person looking at the same thing were
gonna

01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
they were taking out the judgment one
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
person another person were gonna kind of
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
have the same interpretation and be able
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
to record it the same way
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
and so they were able to go back to beas
 
01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
and say hey you need to think about this
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
a different way um because drilling in
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
to understand those distinctions
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
is just so critical in knowing the story
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
that the data is trying to tell you
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
and i just share that with you folks
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
because i think it i think it sums up
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of what this entire bureau's
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
intended to do is make sure that the
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
data integrity is there
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
and then on top of that do the analysis
 
01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:05.830 align:start position:0%
and then on top of that do the analysis
to

01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
to figure out um what's the story behind
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
program evaluations
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
and and outcomes at a population health
 
01:46:13.119 --> 01:46:15.510 align:start position:0%
and and outcomes at a population health
level

01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
so on this bureau um
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
for some reason i can't oh there we go
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh key accomplishments again i don't
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
want you to
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
let me let me just get a checkpoint with
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
you because we're getting close to
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
when folks are probably thinking about
 
01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
lunch so
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
so the slide deck how much more time do
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
you think you need if you're not
 
01:46:37.199 --> 01:46:38.470 align:start position:0%
you think you need if you're not
interrupted

01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
interrupted
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
probably 10 minutes or i mean we're done
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
with this bureau
 
01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
and then we can look at i'd say this
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
will take one minute to finish
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
um because you know the key
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
accomplishments and there are challenges
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
um you'll want to look at the
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet i can't tell you how long
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
that will take
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty similar to the one you
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
saw before and that it's largely
 
01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
um salaries human capital
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
and then um and then i i did want a
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
minute to go over department audits
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
and that might take five to ten minutes
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
there are accomplishments i don't want
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
to read them to you
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
i will note the middle one that you see
 
01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:23.990 align:start position:0%
i will note the middle one that you see
here

01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719 align:start position:0%
um we worked very closely with the
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
improve their their work
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
on their performance improvement plans
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
for when we go in
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
and have findings related to the work in
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
the community mental health agreement
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
and we we started encouraging them and
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
sort of doing technical assistance on a
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
plan do study
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
act format for the way that they're
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
going to implement those changes
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
necessary for corrective action
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that we saw a nine
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
percent improvement
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
on the quality service review sport so
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
and for some reason oh there we go
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
key challenges this is similar to
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
what you saw before um one is
 
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
is i having strong infrastructure for
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
data collection
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
and analysis and so that means having
 
01:48:25.199 --> 01:48:27.109 align:start position:0%
and analysis and so that means having
the

01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
required agreements in place so that we
 
01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
have access to the data that we need
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
and then ensuring that the various data
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
systems speak to each other
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
dave readers who's going to talk to you
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
after lunch is going to talk about this
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
a whole lot um but it's it's key in our
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
area it's key in all the program areas
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
but i'll just emphasize it as i did last
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
time for
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
fraud waste and abuse detection and
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
identifying our spend
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
and making sure our spend is is
 
01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:54.470 align:start position:0%
and making sure our spend is is
appropriate

01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
and accurate and we're accountable for
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
it in this area
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
it comes down to quality we can't assess
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
good quality unless we have the data to
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
do so
 
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
um highly skilled workforce i
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
you know talked about that quite a bit
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
is really needed for
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
for development of our quality
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
management and data analytics and
 
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:16.950 align:start position:0%
management and data analytics and
reporting

01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
and i i think you know it's um this is
 
01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:20.229 align:start position:0%
and i i think you know it's um this is
just

01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
an area that requires a very skilled
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
workforce to do the work um
 
01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
and then you know lastly i think is is
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
something a lot of program areas
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
struggle with there's just kind of
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
increased expectations of what we can
 
01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:34.950 align:start position:0%
increased expectations of what we can
accomplish

01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
um but not necessarily additional
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
resources so we don't
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
might not get the additional staff or
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
additional funding for new i.t systems
 
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
but everybody kind of wants more
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
so so as i as i get to know your
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
department over
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
time uh one of the things that i'll
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
i'll be wanting to fill in the blanks
 
01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:58.870 align:start position:0%
i'll be wanting to fill in the blanks
around

01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
are the kind of the um the so what
 
01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:02.870 align:start position:0%
are the kind of the um the so what
questions

01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
you know if if you if you're producing
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
really great
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
quality information so what what what's
 
01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:10.870 align:start position:0%
quality information so what what what's
the

01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
what's the connection point between
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
really great information you're
 
01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:16.070 align:start position:0%
really great information you're
producing

01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
producing
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
to changes in dhhs or other
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
organizational behavior
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
so that we're buying data that's useful
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
and not just doing an academic study
 
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
you are speaking my language i i totally
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question because
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's what we're always really asking
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
in this division
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
we're working with program areas to say
 
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
to them
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
let's look at your data and ask the
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
question so what
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
you put all this money into these sets
 
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
of providers or these sets of services
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
where did it get us how well was that
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
program performed
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
how much better off is that population
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
how are you gonna know and then how do
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
you manage to that
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
how do you respond so now you've got
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
this set of data
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
what are you doing with it there's a lot
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
of data produced in this
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
department for the purpose of federal
 
01:51:08.239 --> 01:51:09.350 align:start position:0%
department for the purpose of federal
reporting

01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm making all this data and i
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
literally just give it to the feds
 
01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
because they require it
 
01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
but then what do i do have i managed to
 
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
it have i said so for example with um
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
with our
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
quality assurance group and this isn't
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
my favorite example because it's
 
01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
federally required that we do quality
 
01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:25.830 align:start position:0%
federally required that we do quality
assurance

01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
assurance
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
but um but we you know we do these
 
01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:29.669 align:start position:0%
but um but we you know we do these
audits

01:51:29.669 --> 01:51:29.679 align:start position:0%
audits
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
of food stamp eligibility and then we
 
01:51:32.239 --> 01:51:32.790 align:start position:0%
of food stamp eligibility and then we
report

01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
on those to the feds and and that's
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's meeting the requirement
 
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't do us any good unless we
 
01:51:41.109 --> 01:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
turn around and partner with our bureau
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
of family assistance
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
and get to the root cause and say hey
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
your error rate is this
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
let's drill into individual topic areas
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
and improve that error rate
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
one by one and we can teach you how to
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
do it we can do a plan do study act
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
we can do all kinds of things to show is
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
this working to change is it moving the
 
01:51:58.800 --> 01:51:59.589 align:start position:0%
this working to change is it moving the
needle

01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
needle
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's the question we always ask are
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
you moving the needle in the direction
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
you want to see it go
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
so so i but i fully appreciate it
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
applies to our
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
division as well are we moving the
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
needle so as we have these conversations
 
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
with program areas
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
are we having an impact on them to
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
actually manage
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
better i think we're
 
01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
very much on the same page absolutely
 
01:52:23.119 --> 01:52:26.470 align:start position:0%
very much on the same page absolutely
yep

01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much um i would just
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
second everything that mira just said
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
what i mean on the page the previous
 
01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:43.350 align:start position:0%
what i mean on the page the previous
page

01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
about the key challenges the i.t
 
01:52:49.109 --> 01:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
challenge for this department is a
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
continuing saga
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's going on for years and
 
01:52:57.669 --> 01:52:57.679 align:start position:0%
it really behooves the
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
state to bring everything up to date so
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
we can get the answers everyone wants
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
everything's outdated everything we just
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
hear this every time we have a budget
 
01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:11.350 align:start position:0%
hear this every time we have a budget
discussion

01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
so could we go back to the others the
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
previous slide with the
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
with the areas of uh the one more i
 
01:53:17.599 --> 01:53:18.550 align:start position:0%
with the areas of uh the one more i
think

01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
okay so to me the conversation we just
 
01:53:22.159 --> 01:53:22.950 align:start position:0%
okay so to me the conversation we just
had

01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh uh emphasizes the the box on the left
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
but there's a a fourth missing box of
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
key challenges
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
i think and that is that you're a new a
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
relatively new organization
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's not really ingrained into the
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
management culture
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
so that you can help set up a
 
01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:43.669 align:start position:0%
so that you can help set up a
data-driven

01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
data-driven
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
management system that that performs and
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
can be measured
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
am i am i just making that up or am i
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
hearing you right
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of it's sort of
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
a couple different i'm gonna i'm gonna
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
break it up a little bit one
 
01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:02.639 align:start position:0%
is access to data is just
 
01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
really critical um and that's not
 
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
always related to funding but sometimes
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
and then the second piece is really that
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
data integration and data management
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
systems yes
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say that's necessarily
 
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
because we are a new
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
division um we can use data management
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
systems that exist
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
already in the department and in the
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
state but it is
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes a matter of having funding for
 
01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
more licenses
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
and and maybe sometimes it's a matter of
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
getting new
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
data systems but but sometimes it's a
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
matter of um
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
just being able to access what already
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
exists right
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
well i thought i had heard that maybe
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
there's a key challenge in having
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
the the management of the other
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
divisions of dhhs
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
responsive to a data-driven management
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
program uh yes i hear what you're saying
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
i would not say that's necessarily i.t
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
related sorry i'm just trying to
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying is that a fourth key
 
01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:06.709 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying is that a fourth key
challenge

01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter we don't need let's
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
let's move on
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay did you have a question i'd like to
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
say i don't think it's a challenge
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
yet we are relatively new and i'd like
 
01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
to think that they will be responsive as
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
we engage with them
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
so far we've been working pretty
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
intensely with the bureau of drug and
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
alcohol services in particular
 
01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
and they are very responsive to our um
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
our partnership i'll put it that way
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:34.629 --> 01:55:34.639 align:start position:0%
representative bean it looked like you
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
may have had a question i don't want to
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
is there another question no we're ready
 
01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
for you to keep going
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.709 --> 01:56:02.719 align:start position:0%
so at this point um do we want to
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
take a look at the budget page itself
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
please and that would be
 
01:56:13.510 --> 01:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
budget book page 1182. karen i'll stop
 
01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:17.830 align:start position:0%
budget book page 1182. karen i'll stop
sharing

01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
so so as i look at this um ms rounds
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh the one that jumps out to me
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
is um you've got total salaries
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
if you add them all up it's it's like
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
2.3 million
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
and all the fringe benefits is about 1.2
 
01:56:35.599 --> 01:56:36.629 align:start position:0%
and all the fringe benefits is about 1.2
million

01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:36.639 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
so that looks to be about a 54 percent
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
of that for your salaries you've got
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
another 54
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
for fringe benefits and that just that
 
01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to me
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
like that percentage holds up across the
 
01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:52.390 align:start position:0%
like that percentage holds up across the
other

01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
divisions and i'm curious if there's
 
01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:55.830 align:start position:0%
divisions and i'm curious if there's
just

01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:56:57.589 --> 01:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
if i'm doing bad math or if there's
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
something anomalous about
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
the way fringes are calculated here
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
i can get that information from you
 
01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
again the fringe benefits are
 
01:57:09.669 --> 01:57:09.679 align:start position:0%
we're told how we have to calculate
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
those so i i will get you that
 
01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:12.629 align:start position:0%
those so i i will get you that
information

01:57:12.629 --> 01:57:12.639 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay but but 50 you know i'm used to
 
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm used to seeing in the 30s a lot
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know but 54 just seems
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
outrageous like something's there could
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
be an error there or something i don't
 
01:57:27.199 --> 01:57:27.990 align:start position:0%
be an error there or something i don't
know

01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
okay does 54 sound about right is that
 
01:57:33.669 --> 01:57:33.679 align:start position:0%
i i honestly don't know off the top of
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
my head there's so many other numbers i
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
memorize i don't
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh memorize the dash percentages all
 
01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:40.229 align:start position:0%
uh memorize the dash percentages all
right

01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
so in this division and maybe it's true
 
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
in others i would just ask you to take a
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
look at the two lines on
 
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
on benefits and relative to all the
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
salaries and
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
because it just doesn't make sense
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
looking at it to me
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
we can provide you how das um requires
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
that to be calculated
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
right were there
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
i interrupted you before you could say
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
anything about these line items did you
 
01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
you want to tell us something it looks
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
all like it's very flat
 
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
line budgeting it's all no more people
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
a one percent change in the state budget
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
is there
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
is there something here that you you
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
want to highlight to us
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
i don't think so are there any questions
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative um just my
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
question that i had asked before were
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
there any prioritized
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
needs that were not not addressed here
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
and is this the um request that you
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
um gave to the governor's budget
 
01:58:42.719 --> 01:58:45.830 align:start position:0%
um gave to the governor's budget
director

01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
i do not believe there were any
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs here um
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
and i do believe it is the request that
 
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
we gave to the governor
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you could i ask one further
 
01:58:57.270 --> 01:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
question yes ma'am
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh i must i might have missed it but
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
what is your vacancy rate in this in
 
01:59:06.149 --> 01:59:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
in this unit i believe it's pretty low
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
susan do we have
 
01:59:13.109 --> 01:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
one or two one
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
we currently have one position that's
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
vacant for the 28.
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you good news
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
are there any questions or other
 
01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:25.830 align:start position:0%
are there any questions or other
questions

01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:28.629 --> 01:59:28.639 align:start position:0%
okay so where where are we at or do we
 
01:59:30.070 --> 01:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
have another presentation or
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
does that wrap it up just just
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
department audits i have two slides on
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
department-wide audits
 
01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:40.229 align:start position:0%
department-wide audits
right

01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
um am i sharing it or not this may be my
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
favorite two slides
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
okay didn't you i i completely
 
01:59:50.239 --> 01:59:51.910 align:start position:0%
okay didn't you i i completely
understand

01:59:51.910 --> 01:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:59:55.589 --> 01:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
you should um i am also
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
very interested in audits and auditing
 
02:00:03.589 --> 02:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
which i got back to my powerpoint here
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:21.669 --> 02:00:21.679 align:start position:0%
oh this and this sorry this was the
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
slide that you had
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
referenced and asked about if we had an
 
02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:26.470 align:start position:0%
referenced and asked about if we had an
additional

02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
five percent or a five percent reduction
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh what would we do with that so you can
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
see here at data systems enhancements um
 
02:00:36.149 --> 02:00:36.159 align:start position:0%
you know once we have a chance to look
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
through those rfis
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
we would perhaps choose to engage in a
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
contract with a vendor for
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
um fraud um
 
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
data analytics specifically we would
 
02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
probably expand our use of
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
salesforce systems because those are
 
02:00:56.639 --> 02:00:57.750 align:start position:0%
salesforce systems because those are
really

02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
helpful systems for managing
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
cases and instances of fraud or also
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
we would expand what we can do for all
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
areas of the department in terms of
 
02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
quality and performance
 
02:01:16.629 --> 02:01:16.639 align:start position:0%
measures i mean right now we're really
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
medicaid and then dltss and we do some
 
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
work with
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
with behavioral health and we do some
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
work with um the bureau
 
02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
of drug and alcohol services but we're
 
02:01:30.310 --> 02:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
limited in what we can do
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
not because those areas aren't
 
02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:33.830 align:start position:0%
not because those areas aren't
requesting

02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
more help but because we we don't have
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
the staff and the time
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
to get into all those areas so i was
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
approached by um
 
02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
chris santaniello this is quite some
 
02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
time ago in uh
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
division of economic and housing
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
supports to help with a qa
 
02:01:52.950 --> 02:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
process for her work and we we don't
 
02:01:54.629 --> 02:01:54.639 align:start position:0%
have the staff for that kind of thing so
 
02:01:56.470 --> 02:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
we would expand into many other program
 
02:01:57.990 --> 02:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
areas of the department to meet their
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
needs as far as
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
quality and performance metrics if we
 
02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:02.470 align:start position:0%
quality and performance metrics if we
could

02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:02:05.109 --> 02:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
i think one of the key things that we're
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
interested in and i know department
 
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
leadership is interested in is enhanced
 
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
contract management
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
so part of what we're doing now is what
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
i talked about with sub-recipient
 
02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:14.629 align:start position:0%
i talked about with sub-recipient
monitoring

02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:14.639 align:start position:0%
monitoring
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
but being able to build stronger systems
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
of contract management
 
02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
right now what we do for program quality
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
as i showed you in health services
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
assessment is pretty limited in
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
scope so we have a few providers that we
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
do very intense reviews
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
on but we don't really have a mechanism
 
02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
to help
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
all of the other program areas of the
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
department engage in
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
active contract management and we would
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
if we could
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
but that's not an area that we have
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
resources to focus on right now
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
and then what's kind of the so what
 
02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:51.430 align:start position:0%
and then what's kind of the so what
their

02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
contract management well the ones that
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
are established and ongoing
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
are you are you concerned that there's
 
02:03:00.149 --> 02:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
some potential fraud that there's what i
 
02:03:00.159 --> 02:03:00.790 align:start position:0%
some potential fraud that there's what i
mean

02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:02.719 align:start position:0%
what what what do you think would happen
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
if you had better
 
02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh contract management for that
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
uncovered set
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
i think it's i think it is fraud on the
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
one side although we
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
are beefing up our ability to do
 
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
financial reviews
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
of providers on a risk basis so i'm
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
because we have that centralized
 
02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:22.310 align:start position:0%
because we have that centralized
function

02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
function
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
in our program integrity group but on
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
the program
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
side that's the side that i think
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's room for
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
improvement in that um our
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
programs are doing oversight of their
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
vendors but
 
02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
not necessarily from a risk perspective
 
02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
um and not necessarily in terms of
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
when you think about active contract
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
management you we can
 
02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
use our contracts to
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
improve our population health if we've
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
got the right
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
metrics in there and we actually do
 
02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
active oversight of them so we have to
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
we have to put a spotlight on it and say
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
to the providers hey
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
we've got 12 v providers out here right
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
and your median for this particular
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
metric is 12 percent
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
we want to see the whole the whole
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
median get to 15
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
for example well now if i know the
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
median is 12
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
i can call out two or three providers
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
who are way below that median and say
 
02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:20.229 align:start position:0%
who are way below that median and say
hey

02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
hey
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
you guys you're the problem you're the
 
02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
reason that as a state
 
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're only hitting 12 on this metric
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of active contract
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
management i'm referring to and
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
our program areas are not really engaged
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
in that kind of contract management at
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
this point
 
02:04:40.229 --> 02:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
i also just add to that that there this
 
02:04:41.830 --> 02:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
is where there's a strong relationship
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
between the work that meredith does
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
and the work that my team does in
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
contracts and finance
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
um and i would just share from my
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
previous experience as an auditor
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
that uh you know 95 of the time when you
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
find an
 
02:04:57.550 --> 02:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
issue it's a mistake or or a
 
02:04:57.560 --> 02:04:59.030 align:start position:0%
issue it's a mistake or or a
misunderstanding

02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
that that five percent is where you find
 
02:05:04.149 --> 02:05:04.159 align:start position:0%
some fraud or some purposeful
 
02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
um disregard but even sometimes
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
purposeful disregard isn't necessarily
 
02:05:08.639 --> 02:05:09.589 align:start position:0%
purposeful disregard isn't necessarily
fraud

02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
it i i get a little nervous with the
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
word fraud because it
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's not always that a lot of times it's
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you definitely yep and then
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
another um skill that we'd like to be
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
able to develop or something that we
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
would do more of
 
02:05:30.550 --> 02:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
if we had the resources to do it is
 
02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:31.589 align:start position:0%
if we had the resources to do it is
in-house

02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
in-house
 
02:05:34.550 --> 02:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
strategic planning expertise so this is
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
something that's done across the
 
02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
department sometimes in-house
 
02:05:40.149 --> 02:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes with an external vendor we
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
do have
 
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
folks who are highly skilled at
 
02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
facilitating these kinds of
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
conversations about
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
helping you develop your your mission
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
statement your
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
um key goals
 
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
and objectives and key performance
 
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
indicators but um
 
02:06:02.550 --> 02:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily all rolled into a
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
strategic planning
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
exercise and that's something i think we
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
would like to develop
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
because we've used external vendors
 
02:06:13.589 --> 02:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
to varying degrees of success um i'm
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
sure folks on this
 
02:06:17.109 --> 02:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
call have had the same experience just
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
in their lives
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
um sometimes in-house strategic planning
 
02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:22.069 align:start position:0%
um sometimes in-house strategic planning
exercises

02:06:22.069 --> 02:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
exercises
 
02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
can be successful but you have to take a
 
02:06:25.990 --> 02:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
lot of time
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
out of your normal day-to-day work in
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
order to engage in that kind of thing
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
and if you're trying to actually run the
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
process yourself it's that much harder
 
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
so i think being able to centralize that
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
function and have one
 
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
area that's really got the expertise
 
02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
where we can partner with individual
 
02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
program areas on their strategic plans
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
and development of dashboards
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
that would be it would be a long-term
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
benefit to everyone
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
is that redundant or integrated with
 
02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
what the management office ought to be
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
doing we heard that brief last thursday
 
02:06:56.830 --> 02:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh when you refer to the management
 
02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:58.229 align:start position:0%
uh when you refer to the management
office

02:06:58.229 --> 02:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure who that would be the
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
you're um so so from the commissioner's
 
02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
office presentations
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
last week not sure specifically which
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
one you're referring to
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
there was a budget a bunch of budget
 
02:07:26.470 --> 02:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
line items that said management office
 
02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay i'll have to take a look at that
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
so let's not pursue that and just say as
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about that
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
please don't be redundant look for
 
02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:38.550 align:start position:0%
please don't be redundant look for
integration

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
integration
 
02:07:41.589 --> 02:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
believe me this division is constantly
 
02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
looking for efficiencies
 
02:07:45.030 --> 02:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
we're very lean oriented we would not
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
want to duplicate something someone else
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
is doing
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
um and that and that includes so for
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
example i was referring to
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
hr because they do they do have a
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
function like this that works with other
 
02:07:58.149 --> 02:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
people and we would make sure we're not
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
you have your decrements you want to
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
talk about and the decrements
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
fewer reviews really i mean it just
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
comes down to less of what we're doing
 
02:08:14.550 --> 02:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
and doing it with less rigor so we would
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
decrease our sample sizes we'd have to
 
02:08:21.030 --> 02:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
decrease the number of um
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh things selected for review maybe a
 
02:08:25.350 --> 02:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
smaller distribution of things selected
 
02:08:29.350 --> 02:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
or just um um
 
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
smaller uh samples within each area of
 
02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:33.990 align:start position:0%
smaller uh samples within each area of
distribution

02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
um definitely believe a likelihood of
 
02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:37.750 align:start position:0%
um definitely believe a likelihood of
increased

02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
increased
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
um audit findings and repeat audit
 
02:08:40.639 --> 02:08:41.830 align:start position:0%
um audit findings and repeat audit
findings

02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
findings
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
and poor medicaid cost containment
 
02:08:44.639 --> 02:08:45.830 align:start position:0%
and poor medicaid cost containment
generally

02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
generally
 
02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
so so my question about that is that
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
there's this generally this
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
is burrito principle about the 80 20
 
02:08:51.599 --> 02:08:52.629 align:start position:0%
is burrito principle about the 80 20
rule

02:08:52.629 --> 02:08:52.639 align:start position:0%
rule
 
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh where you get 80 percent of the bang
 
02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
for your buck out of 20
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
of the effort so so as you look at at
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
the reviews and uh where do you think we
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
are relative to the 80 20 rule
 
02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're only doing five
 
02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
percent or we're hitting the 20
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to give us an 80 return
 
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:16.470 --> 02:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
so you're i mean i think it's getting a
 
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
little bit to what
 
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
karen is referring to right like we do a
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
series of reviews
 
02:09:24.069 --> 02:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
and then we kind of say um not
 
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
all of this is fraud some of it is just
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
an issue that we need to deal with
 
02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:31.430 align:start position:0%
an issue that we need to deal with
elsewhere

02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
is that kind of what you're asking you
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
for what your instinct is are we on the
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
80 20
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
cusp or are we way under or over
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
getting the 80 20 rule implemented in
 
02:09:45.890 --> 02:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
your department
 
02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:47.430 align:start position:0%
your department
[Music]

02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
what we are doing is
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
trying very hard to make to orient all
 
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
of our work
 
02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
toward risk so i don't
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
really want to fall into an 80 20 where
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
only 20
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
of our work is producing 80 of the
 
02:10:04.719 --> 02:10:05.750 align:start position:0%
of our work is producing 80 of the
benefit

02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
we're trying to parse out the work so
 
02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:09.510 align:start position:0%
we're trying to parse out the work so
that

02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:12.229 --> 02:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
we can say based on the risk level of
 
02:10:14.310 --> 02:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that we're doing
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to focus we're going to
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
orient all of our work
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
that direction so that we're getting
 
02:10:21.030 --> 02:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
more bang for our buck
 
02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
so for example um i mean i think i
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
referenced this in terms of the contract
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
oversight we have a formal risk analysis
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
process where for both finance
 
02:10:34.629 --> 02:10:34.639 align:start position:0%
and program we evaluate our contractors
 
02:10:36.709 --> 02:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
when they submit an rfpos
 
02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
and say you are high risk for finance
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
not for program but you are for finance
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
so we're going to enhance our oversight
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
of you on the financial side or
 
02:10:44.639 --> 02:10:45.430 align:start position:0%
of you on the financial side or
conversely

02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
conversely
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're not worried about you financially
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
but we see risk as related to the
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
program area
 
02:10:51.669 --> 02:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
so we're going to shift our resources
 
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
and pay attention to you in the program
 
02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:54.310 align:start position:0%
and pay attention to you in the program
area

02:10:54.310 --> 02:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
so we i mean because we have limited
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
resources we don't want
 
02:10:59.510 --> 02:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
everybody to just do everything
 
02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
uniformly and say
 
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
well within 20 of this we're going to
 
02:11:05.189 --> 02:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
get 80
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
of the work out of it we want to say out
 
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
of everything that we're doing
 
02:11:12.629 --> 02:11:12.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to make sure that maybe 20
 
02:11:14.790 --> 02:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
of it is focused on low to moderate risk
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
but 80
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
of it is focused on high risk because
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's where we need to be concerned
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you i don't know if that
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
answers your question but it's sort of
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
the philosophy of the way we approach
 
02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
all of our work
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's the start of a two-year
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
conversation i think yes
 
02:11:33.189 --> 02:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
indeed so um are we ready for the audit
 
02:11:33.199 --> 02:11:33.910 align:start position:0%
indeed so um are we ready for the audit
yeah

02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
audits yes so we've got a few different
 
02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
types of audits
 
02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
i i saw that one of the requests was the
 
02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
last 10 years of audits
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
i have that i can get it to you but it's
 
02:11:47.669 --> 02:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's hundreds of audits and
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
literally thousands of findings
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to start with just a
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
description of what we have in terms of
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
audits what our audit life
 
02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
looks like at the department and then we
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
can go into whatever
 
02:12:01.270 --> 02:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
additional detail makes sense let's skip
 
02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:01.990 align:start position:0%
additional detail makes sense let's skip
this

02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
because i see you got a list and we can
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
follow up this is great
 
02:12:07.350 --> 02:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
just uh do you have a slide that gives
 
02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
us a us
 
02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
an idea of what you're doing for a
 
02:12:12.390 --> 02:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
corrective actions program
 
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
for findings so for
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
recurring audits single audit finding
 
02:12:18.719 --> 02:12:19.430 align:start position:0%
recurring audits single audit finding
okay

02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
these are kind of examples this isn't
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive obviously but i'm trying
 
02:12:24.629 --> 02:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
to give you a sense of what we do
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
and and what we're looking at in terms
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
of findings so the single audit we get
 
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
every year they're looking at
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
five to ten major programs across the
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
department and
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
in addition they'll do a handful of um
 
02:12:40.629 --> 02:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
type b like lesser programs and
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
out of that we'll have
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
we've been reducing the number of
 
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
findings we get it used to be
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
over 20 sometimes close to 30 and and
 
02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
now it's it's down maybe closer to a
 
02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
dozen i mean it depends on the year
 
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
um but so one of the recent findings we
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
had was non-compliance with
 
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort requirements in
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
our um
 
02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
what's public health emergency program i
 
02:13:07.350 --> 02:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
think and hospital
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
hospital emergency preparedness program
 
02:13:10.239 --> 02:13:10.870 align:start position:0%
hospital emergency preparedness program
yes

02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:13:13.589 --> 02:13:13.599 align:start position:0%
go ahead sorry so so you're doing very
 
02:13:13.599 --> 02:13:14.069 align:start position:0%
go ahead sorry so so you're doing very
well

02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
at answering the the what i'm i'm
 
02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:17.750 align:start position:0%
at answering the the what i'm i'm
actually

02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
questioning about the how how do you
 
02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
manage your corrective action program
 
02:13:26.069 --> 02:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
how are you taking these audits putting
 
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
them into
 
02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
some kind of a findings tracker how are
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
you managing the
 
02:13:34.870 --> 02:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
delegation of responsibility i'm
 
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
i'm more because because the the what is
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
going to change over time but i'm really
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
curious about
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
the how so we have
 
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
three different areas of the department
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
that are responsive to audits
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
one is our internal auditor is managing
 
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
all of the lba audits
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
one is our financial compliance unit and
 
02:13:56.950 --> 02:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
they're managing all of the federal
 
02:14:00.629 --> 02:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
audits and then um our in our within our
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
bureau of information systems
 
02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
our privacy officer is managing i.t
 
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
related audits so they're kind of
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
divvied up when we get
 
02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
a new audit notice those three have a
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
conversation and say all right who's
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
lead on this particular item and then
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
they act as a liaison like what i was
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
describing before they would act as a
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
liaison between the program area
 
02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
finance managers in that area or the i.t
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
the systems owners in that area
 
02:14:28.709 --> 02:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
and the auditor and say all right what
 
02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
does the auditor need for documentation
 
02:14:32.310 --> 02:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
what's happening what are they looking
 
02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:32.629 align:start position:0%
what's happening what are they looking
at

02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
what does it look like they're gonna
 
02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
find in this instance
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
and and manage the audit itself and then
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
the findings come in
 
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
and then that same person whoever it was
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
that was the lead is also responsible
 
02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
for managing the corrective action plan
 
02:14:51.109 --> 02:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:56.229 --> 02:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
holistic top-down view of all the
 
02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
outstanding corrective actions
 
02:15:05.910 --> 02:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
and that and and that we do not
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
we do not so we are looking
 
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
yep we are looking to we are it's kind
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
of in development
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
um as we speak but that is a key area
 
02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we are trying to
 
02:15:20.870 --> 02:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
work on so just to tie you in i i have
 
02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
asked mr
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
kane and mr smith from lba to reach out
 
02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
to you to talk about
 
02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
correction action uh plan formatting and
 
02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:32.790 align:start position:0%
correction action uh plan formatting and
reporting

02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
02:15:34.550 --> 02:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
because it sounded to me earlier that
 
02:15:36.069 --> 02:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
you you may have something
 
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
that you use so if they reach out to you
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
don't be surprised yep absolutely and we
 
02:15:42.719 --> 02:15:43.109 align:start position:0%
don't be surprised yep absolutely and we
can

02:15:43.109 --> 02:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
certainly have that conversation um it's
 
02:15:50.229 --> 02:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
it's having a holistic
 
02:15:53.189 --> 02:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
single system is certainly a goal of
 
02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
ours because we want to be able to have
 
02:15:56.069 --> 02:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
at our fingertips
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
where is this finding where what is the
 
02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
status of it in every instance
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't exist yet so far we're
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
having to manage
 
02:16:08.229 --> 02:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
the individual audit areas manually
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
i i really appreciate your your honesty
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
and directness
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
because you know a lot of people don't
 
02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
like to share things that aren't perfect
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate your honor
 
02:16:20.149 --> 02:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
i think we're we're very much on the
 
02:16:22.069 --> 02:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
same page you know i mean i i want to
 
02:16:23.350 --> 02:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
see that improvement
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
and we have i think what's really
 
02:16:26.550 --> 02:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
important is that a lot of what this
 
02:16:27.990 --> 02:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
division does
 
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
a a share i say like 100 of what this
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
division does is
 
02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
we put a spotlight on the areas that are
 
02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
more like
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
um kind of administrative functions that
 
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
the program areas can't really spend all
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
of their time on
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
and when you put a spotlight on
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
something it changes necessarily
 
02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
even though people don't even they're
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
not even planning on it changing just
 
02:16:51.509 --> 02:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
because you keep
 
02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
poking them on it and saying hey this
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
metric is still 12
 
02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
hey this metric is still they can't even
 
02:16:58.950 --> 02:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
help it they start focusing on it and
 
02:17:00.389 --> 02:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
the next thing you know it starts to
 
02:17:00.399 --> 02:17:01.110 align:start position:0%
the next thing you know it starts to
change

02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:17:02.709 --> 02:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
and we do that in a lot of different
 
02:17:04.469 --> 02:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
areas including on the
 
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
audit report so like i said even without
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
that system in place
 
02:17:09.750 --> 02:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
we brought down outstanding findings
 
02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
from 63 to 9
 
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
just by putting a spotlight on it and
 
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
and also i mean i think part of it is
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
um the oddities may not they just don't
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
always speak the language they don't
 
02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:21.349 align:start position:0%
always speak the language they don't
always

02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
always
 
02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
understand what the auditor is looking
 
02:17:24.319 --> 02:17:24.950 align:start position:0%
understand what the auditor is looking
for

02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:17:29.110 --> 02:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
as a as a remedy so us being able to say
 
02:17:30.549 --> 02:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
no no they're not looking for the thing
 
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
you're doing they want to see
 
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
like a formalized risk management plan
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
or something like that
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
being able to speak the language we've
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
certainly managed to make improvements
 
02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:39.750 align:start position:0%
certainly managed to make improvements
but

02:17:39.750 --> 02:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have the system you're
 
02:17:43.669 --> 02:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
referring to so if i need to know
 
02:17:45.429 --> 02:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
where if where findings are i have to go
 
02:17:47.349 --> 02:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
to the individual audit manager and say
 
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
tell me where this is at and what are we
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
doing with it
 
02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh is there one more
 
02:17:53.359 --> 02:17:54.709 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh is there one more
slide

02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
slide
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
i think this is oh there is this is
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
specifically related to um information
 
02:18:00.719 --> 02:18:01.990 align:start position:0%
specifically related to um information
security

02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
security
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
type audits and findings
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
i don't like that pci i will
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
warn you right now this is not my area
 
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
of expertise um but we do liaise with
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
bis for their audit management and they
 
02:18:18.389 --> 02:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
work with us on our audit management
 
02:18:19.110 --> 02:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
because it's all
 
02:18:23.349 --> 02:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
it's all intermingled all right okay
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
are there any questions anyone uh
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
representative walner what what what
 
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
what what should we be asking here
 
02:18:35.429 --> 02:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry i'd have to look through
 
02:18:36.309 --> 02:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
this slide for
 
02:18:38.619 --> 02:18:38.629 align:start position:0%
for quite a while longer um
 
02:18:38.629 --> 02:18:39.910 align:start position:0%
for quite a while longer um
[Music]

02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
so do you think this is something we
 
02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
need to look back on in three months
 
02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
after the
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
hard work of the budget is done to just
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
okay the question one question i would
 
02:18:58.709 --> 02:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
have and i
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
i now i lost the slide again
 
02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
meredith i guess one thing that would be
 
02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:06.150 align:start position:0%
meredith i guess one thing that would be
interesting

02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:08.230 align:start position:0%
for me to know about um
 
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:09.429 align:start position:0%
for me to know about um
[Music]

02:19:09.429 --> 02:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
these audits and these findings is
 
02:19:17.110 --> 02:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
are any of them causing us to lose
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
federal federal money
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
on this area i
 
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
can't answer that right now um dave
 
02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:28.950 align:start position:0%
can't answer that right now um dave
weeders

02:19:28.950 --> 02:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
weeders
 
02:19:33.589 --> 02:19:33.599 align:start position:0%
might be one moment let's see if i can
 
02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
answer that question in real time
 
02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
um why don't we take that offline right
 
02:19:41.669 --> 02:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
right write that down and get back to us
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
are any of these could so the answer is
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
they could cause us to lose
 
02:19:49.830 --> 02:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
but they are not yet they're not at this
 
02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:50.870 align:start position:0%
but they are not yet they're not at this
time

02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:59.349 --> 02:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
well yes thank you and well on the other
 
02:19:59.359 --> 02:20:00.309 align:start position:0%
well yes thank you and well on the other
side

02:20:00.309 --> 02:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:20:03.429 --> 02:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
um the fact that maybe we're
 
02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
finding out we should have gotten more
 
02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:06.870 align:start position:0%
finding out we should have gotten more
money

02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:20:10.389 --> 02:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
so both sides of the coin hopefully
 
02:20:13.510 --> 02:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
we'll discover um that's
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
going to yeah
 
02:20:20.469 --> 02:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
yeah um representative uh
 
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
weiler i did i just want to since i've
 
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
i've listened to you talk about
 
02:20:27.429 --> 02:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
audits in fiscal committee i just wanted
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
to give you a chance to say something
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
since we've gone through it here oh i'm
 
02:20:33.910 --> 02:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
delighted that
 
02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
that something is happening central i
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the
 
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
effects of this division before on
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
helping these others with answering
 
02:20:43.750 --> 02:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
the audits and i guess one of the first
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
ones is going to be the new hampshire
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh home or new hampshire hospital which
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
had a fairly fairly serious audit last
 
02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
time so
 
02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'll be looking forward to see what
 
02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
happens and when i do see answers
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
this unit doesn't really get credited i
 
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
do read a lot of audits and now we've
 
02:21:03.750 --> 02:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
decided this last meeting we want
 
02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
monthly follow-ups to see what the
 
02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
progress is because otherwise
 
02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
we see a budget that uh we see an audit
 
02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:10.790 align:start position:0%
we see a budget that uh we see an audit
that

02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
is a follow-up on one from 10 years
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
before and the majority of the findings
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
are still outstanding
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
so yes there is a definite need to
 
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
do quicker follow-up and do more things
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
happening so
 
02:21:26.070 --> 02:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm looking forward to seeing what this
 
02:21:28.469 --> 02:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
division can accomplish thank you
 
02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
and just so you know representative we
 
02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
have set
 
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
a task for ourselves to be responsive to
 
02:21:36.870 --> 02:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
all the audit findings within 24 months
 
02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're looking at right
 
02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
now very good
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
so is there a are there budget line
 
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
items that go with this uh
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
this segment of the briefing or we've
 
02:21:48.630 --> 02:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
already hit them i imagine no we've hit
 
02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:50.150 align:start position:0%
already hit them i imagine no we've hit
them

02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
okay all right so uh i'm getting ready
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
to call a recess for
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
for lunch uh but before we go does
 
02:21:59.110 --> 02:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
anyone have any
 
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
have i missed you does everyone have
 
02:22:02.469 --> 02:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
their questions answered
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes sir mr representative weiler uh do
 
02:22:07.830 --> 02:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
we have another slide deck to download
 
02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
i think we already have that i think you
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
received that
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
via email the other day and it's also on
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
our website
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
what am i looking for i don't remember
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's called ocomb information
 
02:22:40.150 --> 02:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
the cover slide has david find it when
 
02:22:43.750 --> 02:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
i can i can email it to you again too if
 
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's easier yeah i appreciate that
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so uh it's now
 
02:22:56.469 --> 02:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
at 12 22. um why don't we
 
02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh recess until one o'clock
 
02:23:02.830 --> 02:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
uh does anyone feel like that's too
 
02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:05.110 align:start position:0%
uh does anyone feel like that's too
rushed

02:23:05.110 --> 02:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
rushed
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
all right so um so with that um
 
02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
we're recessed until one o'clock enjoy
 
02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
your lunch
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay so so let me let me at just ask you
 
02:23:27.670 --> 02:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
to summarize this box
 
02:23:31.270 --> 02:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
where mmis is the second bullet of
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
of the of the following
 
02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
systems are there those
 
02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
are those all legacies or are those
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
relatively new implementations
 
02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
and if if they're legacies
 
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
where do they stand on your replacement
 
02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:49.030 align:start position:0%
where do they stand on your replacement
schedule

02:23:49.030 --> 02:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what i want to know about
 
02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
those items certainly
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
so as as i earliest
 
02:23:58.630 --> 02:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
earlier stated mr chair the mmis is our
 
02:24:01.510 --> 02:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
first one on the five year strategy to
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
re-procure visual components
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
the new heights new hampshire easy
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
integrated eligibility system
 
02:24:10.870 --> 02:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
is a system that's been around a while
 
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
but has been properly maintained
 
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
and there was no deferred maintenance on
 
02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
that system so i would say it's actually
 
02:24:21.429 --> 02:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
won many awards in our country for being
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
a very effective integrated eligibility
 
02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:24.950 align:start position:0%
a very effective integrated eligibility
system

02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
our plans to re-procure that begin in
 
02:24:28.399 --> 02:24:29.670 align:start position:0%
our plans to re-procure that begin in
2024

02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
2024
 
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
not in the next biennium the options or
 
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
elderly adult care system
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
is one of our systems that is also at
 
02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:37.270 align:start position:0%
is one of our systems that is also at
risk

02:24:37.270 --> 02:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
risk
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
that we would be looking to reprocure a
 
02:24:40.479 --> 02:24:41.110 align:start position:0%
that we would be looking to reprocure a
solution

02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
solution
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
for it is a homegrown.net
 
02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
application excuse me that
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
we would like to look at a commercial
 
02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:50.790 align:start position:0%
we would like to look at a commercial
off-the-shelf

02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
off-the-shelf
 
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
solution for that could not only combine
 
02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
with elderly adult care but
 
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
developmental services and other areas
 
02:24:58.710 --> 02:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
within long-term supports and services
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
so we can have
 
02:25:02.309 --> 02:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
a single cohesive case management
 
02:25:05.110 --> 02:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
solution to provide those services
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
our nexus or child support system
 
02:25:11.349 --> 02:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
has undergone gone a major overhaul this
 
02:25:11.359 --> 02:25:12.309 align:start position:0%
has undergone gone a major overhaul this
biennium

02:25:12.309 --> 02:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
where we did upgrade the system and did
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
some major releases so we were looking
 
02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:18.710 align:start position:0%
some major releases so we were looking
to

02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
replace that on on a reprocurement
 
02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
roadmap of 2026 beginning that year
 
02:25:27.270 --> 02:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
it would be a two to three year
 
02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
re-procurement program
 
02:25:32.309 --> 02:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
if if at the time the state determined
 
02:25:33.030 --> 02:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
that it was
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
beneficial to replace the system or
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
look at potential enhanced major
 
02:25:40.309 --> 02:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
enhancements at that time
 
02:25:44.309 --> 02:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
the web information technology system
 
02:25:46.309 --> 02:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
also known as wits which is our drug and
 
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol services system
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
is a legacy system that we outsource to
 
02:25:51.590 --> 02:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
a vendor
 
02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
that we don't have in our in our current
 
02:25:57.670 --> 02:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
biennium operational or capital
 
02:25:57.680 --> 02:25:58.389 align:start position:0%
biennium operational or capital
submissions

02:25:58.389 --> 02:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
submissions
 
02:26:01.030 --> 02:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
to replace as it is meeting the
 
02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:02.150 align:start position:0%
to replace as it is meeting the
expectations

02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
expectations
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's not exceeding the expectations but
 
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
we we needed to identify when we would
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
replace it our goal was to start
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
replacing that system in 2024-2025
 
02:26:15.670 --> 02:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
and then our sacquis or child care
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
child welfare information system is a
 
02:26:21.030 --> 02:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
legacy system that's been around for 27
 
02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:21.830 align:start position:0%
legacy system that's been around for 27
years

02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
we currently have a capital program
 
02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
for this biennium as well as planned for
 
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
the next
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
two bienniums to replace that system
 
02:26:34.070 --> 02:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
it has an intake assessment case
 
02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
management and claims component
 
02:26:39.270 --> 02:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
we are we are goal that looking at that
 
02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
claims module
 
02:26:41.910 --> 02:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
and seeing if we have a departmental
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
claims opportunity as opposed to having
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
multiple different claims systems within
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
the department
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
looking at us a centralized claims
 
02:26:54.230 --> 02:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
solution starting in 2025 2025
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
2026 to implement
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
so that we can utilize that for our
 
02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
long-term support services claims for
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
our fee for service claims and that that
 
02:27:07.190 --> 02:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
division as well as our child welfare
 
02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
information services claims and medicaid
 
02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:10.630 align:start position:0%
information services claims and medicaid
claims

02:27:10.630 --> 02:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
claims
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
did that summarize for you mr chairman
 
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you that was that was
 
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
excellent and i know that we're an
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
operations budget
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
group here um in in the future it may be
 
02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:20.550 align:start position:0%
group here um in in the future it may be
nice

02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
nice
 
02:27:23.270 --> 02:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
just to have uh one of the roadmap
 
02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:24.150 align:start position:0%
just to have uh one of the roadmap
slides

02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
slides
 
02:27:27.510 --> 02:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
so we see you know some long-term
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
capital planning just to
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know because i think i think it
 
02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
affects your operational costs too
 
02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
it certainly does that's that that that
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
was actually a question i was asking
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
um our chief financial
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
officer during the break is how do we
 
02:27:43.439 --> 02:27:44.389 align:start position:0%
officer during the break is how do we
coordinate

02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
coordinate
 
02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
the communication between capital and
 
02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:48.870 align:start position:0%
the communication between capital and
operating

02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
operating
 
02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
it because operations is very important
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
but capital
 
02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
impacts the strategic planning and
 
02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:55.510 align:start position:0%
impacts the strategic planning and
directions

02:27:55.510 --> 02:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
directions
 
02:27:57.270 --> 02:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
as well as impacts for future
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
operational costs
 
02:28:02.469 --> 02:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
so representative weiler do you want to
 
02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
feel that or
 
02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
or should we take that offline
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
yeah probably offline i don't want to
 
02:28:10.870 --> 02:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
work on it yet
 
02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank you so so that's a great
 
02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
question and i think
 
02:28:17.270 --> 02:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
collectively the legislature owes you an
 
02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:17.990 align:start position:0%
collectively the legislature owes you an
answer

02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
answer
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know how we'll get it to
 
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
you but we'll keep track of it
 
02:28:25.429 --> 02:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
that's a great question i appreciate
 
02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
that mr chair
 
02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
it appears that you have another
 
02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:29.990 align:start position:0%
it appears that you have another
question

02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
i represented oh oh there you go
 
02:28:33.429 --> 02:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
representative irf
 
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead could you just clap now that
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
you've told us that
 
02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
eight of the people we thought were in
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
your department actually over another
 
02:28:40.319 --> 02:28:41.110 align:start position:0%
your department actually over another
department

02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
could you clarify where the either 22 or
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
18 positions
 
02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
the 22 you currently have or the 18 you
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
will have are in your
 
02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
department sure so
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative erf and mr chair um
 
02:28:57.270 --> 02:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
we have nine positions that are
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
supporting the project management office
 
02:28:59.910 --> 02:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
in lean
 
02:29:01.830 --> 02:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
and then we have nine positions that are
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
current currently supporting
 
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
hardware live hardware application
 
02:29:07.750 --> 02:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
lifecycle management information
 
02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:09.030 align:start position:0%
lifecycle management information
security

02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
security
 
02:29:11.830 --> 02:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
and data warehousing support as well as
 
02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:13.510 align:start position:0%
and data warehousing support as well as
strategic

02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
strategic
 
02:29:15.750 --> 02:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
strategic planning and design so those
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
nine people
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
are broken up into several different
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
program areas
 
02:29:23.830 --> 02:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
we have two for information security one
 
02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:24.710 align:start position:0%
we have two for information security one
for

02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
application lifecycle and hardware
 
02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
lifecycle management
 
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
we have two for data warehousing
 
02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
and reporting that work hand in hand
 
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
with the other data teams
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
so that's up to five and then we have
 
02:29:40.389 --> 02:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
the deputy director and myself
 
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
seven and then the i'm
 
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
getting ahead of myself here and then
 
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
two for information securities
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
nine so those positions are all filled
 
02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
with people
 
02:29:55.270 --> 02:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
they are not those are our total total
 
02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:56.070 align:start position:0%
they are not those are our total total
amounts

02:29:56.070 --> 02:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
so of those we are 33 vacant in both
 
02:29:59.040 --> 02:29:59.910 align:start position:0%
so of those we are 33 vacant in both
teams

02:29:59.910 --> 02:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
teams
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
so we are down three people in each area
 
02:30:03.510 --> 02:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
and so we're
 
02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
essentially operating in with multiple
 
02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:07.110 align:start position:0%
essentially operating in with multiple
hats

02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
hats
 
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
across all of the all of the department
 
02:30:14.469 --> 02:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:17.830 --> 02:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
so just the remainder of this slide here
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
this application life cycle management
 
02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:21.190 align:start position:0%
this application life cycle management
program

02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
is his goal to implement
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
and it did implement this year the grant
 
02:30:28.630 --> 02:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
trace which is our
 
02:30:30.469 --> 02:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
contact tracing patient monitoring and
 
02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
case investigation
 
02:30:34.469 --> 02:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
it leveraged a salesforce platform which
 
02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
our goal is to leverage that platform
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
and the licensing associated with it
 
02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
across our department
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
as much as possible where where and
 
02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
where applicable
 
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
we also implemented and so that
 
02:30:49.670 --> 02:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
grant trace is really focused on covid19
 
02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:50.790 align:start position:0%
grant trace is really focused on covid19
response

02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
response
 
02:30:53.590 --> 02:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
and how we could understand what was
 
02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
happening when
 
02:30:57.429 --> 02:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
when people were identified with cobin
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
and then be able to monitor them
 
02:31:00.630 --> 02:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
and then do case investigation to
 
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
understand community transmission
 
02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire connections solution
 
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
is our child care registry and licensing
 
02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:08.469 align:start position:0%
is our child care registry and licensing
program

02:31:08.469 --> 02:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
which historically has been done in
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
excel spreadsheets and access databases
 
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
which were prone to
 
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
error and failure and so our goal is to
 
02:31:21.750 --> 02:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
implement a system that could manage all
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
of our child care professionals and
 
02:31:24.469 --> 02:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
their registries
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
in training and certifications in a
 
02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
single platform
 
02:31:29.830 --> 02:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
again that was implemented on the
 
02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
salesforce platform
 
02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
as part part of the coven 19 pandemic
 
02:31:35.429 --> 02:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
response to
 
02:31:38.950 --> 02:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
ensure timely certification registry and
 
02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
licensing for those child care
 
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
organizations and then as i
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
spoke about earlier granite families
 
02:31:48.150 --> 02:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
which is our comprehensive child
 
02:31:50.309 --> 02:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
child welfare information system is the
 
02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
replacement for the
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
this item above and application life
 
02:31:56.710 --> 02:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
cycle management of saqquis
 
02:31:59.429 --> 02:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
and it will be a six year plan to
 
02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
replace we're expecting to go live in
 
02:32:02.710 --> 02:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
the year five
 
02:32:05.030 --> 02:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
with that system but incrementally
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
throughout where
 
02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
we have our we're already beginning to
 
02:32:09.750 --> 02:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
go live with parts of it
 
02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
and so why would we do that the benefit
 
02:32:13.990 --> 02:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
is we're able to implement
 
02:32:16.950 --> 02:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
key components that are having what we
 
02:32:17.429 --> 02:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
would call
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
trouble areas and we're implementing an
 
02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
agile methodology which is allowing us
 
02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:23.990 align:start position:0%
agile methodology which is allowing us
to

02:32:23.990 --> 02:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
take ownership of components of the
 
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
system and utilize it
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
earlier than if we just waited until the
 
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
end of five years to start
 
02:32:34.870 --> 02:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
this does two things for us it enhances
 
02:32:37.349 --> 02:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
our services
 
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
sooner which basically improves our
 
02:32:39.760 --> 02:32:40.710 align:start position:0%
sooner which basically improves our
productivity

02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
productivity
 
02:32:42.870 --> 02:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
but it also gives us more visibility to
 
02:32:44.469 --> 02:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
what changes we need to do
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
to meet the end result in five years
 
02:32:51.349 --> 02:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
and then the last one here is ombudsman
 
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
case management
 
02:32:56.230 --> 02:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
and there's other ones as well i believe
 
02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
meredith tillers referred to it briefly
 
02:33:00.790 --> 02:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
we implemented a medicaid quality
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
assurance case management solution on
 
02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
salesforce as well
 
02:33:06.389 --> 02:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
and we were able to do that rather
 
02:33:08.950 --> 02:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
rapidly based off of the federal funding
 
02:33:11.910 --> 02:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
for integrated eligibility components
 
02:33:13.750 --> 02:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
and we were able to leverage it with
 
02:33:16.870 --> 02:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
acf funding as well
 
02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
for granted families so these federal
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
partners have
 
02:33:23.349 --> 02:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
really helped us with 90 10 match or 90
 
02:33:26.710 --> 02:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
federal funds 10 general fund match to
 
02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
acquire the licensing and implement the
 
02:33:28.880 --> 02:33:30.790 align:start position:0%
acquire the licensing and implement the
systems

02:33:30.790 --> 02:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:33:33.030 --> 02:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
so the the last component here is
 
02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
hardware lifecycle
 
02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
management this is the maybe the rest of
 
02:33:38.550 --> 02:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's boring too but this is the super
 
02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
boring part but basically it comes down
 
02:33:40.319 --> 02:33:41.030 align:start position:0%
boring part but basically it comes down
to

02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:33:44.309 --> 02:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
we're replacing servers storage switches
 
02:33:47.190 --> 02:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
computers um pretty much any technology
 
02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
device that allows
 
02:33:51.830 --> 02:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
our clients our users and so i when i
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
refer to clients i
 
02:33:55.910 --> 02:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
my my customers are the employees of the
 
02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
the department
 
02:33:59.670 --> 02:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
on directly and then my further clients
 
02:34:02.309 --> 02:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
are the citizens of new hampshire but
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
this is where we're replacing all that
 
02:34:06.150 --> 02:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
hardware and software
 
02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
we distributed a little over a thousand
 
02:34:10.469 --> 02:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
computers this last year
 
02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
and we plan and we have about a little
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
over 3 400
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
on devices or like laptops or desktops
 
02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the organization that we try
 
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
to replace on a five-year cycle
 
02:34:25.110 --> 02:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
this last year we implemented many more
 
02:34:26.309 --> 02:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
than we normally would
 
02:34:28.950 --> 02:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
as a result of the covid 19 pandemic
 
02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:29.590 align:start position:0%
as a result of the covid 19 pandemic
response

02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
response
 
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
we had to implement computers for
 
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
temporary needs
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
with the national guard being activated
 
02:34:37.030 --> 02:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
as well as large call center
 
02:34:39.990 --> 02:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
implementations so we have a question
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
when you mention these granite things
 
02:34:47.429 --> 02:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
here granite trees and granite families
 
02:34:48.469 --> 02:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
are those kind of granite
 
02:34:48.479 --> 02:34:51.590 align:start position:0%
are those kind of granite
pathways

02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's a good question mr representative
 
02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
irf and mr chair
 
02:34:57.750 --> 02:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
um they're not part of grant pathways
 
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
what we try to do is working with uoit
 
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
i believe everything that like the big
 
02:35:05.270 --> 02:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
enterprise type systems have a reserve
 
02:35:07.349 --> 02:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
name for with granite in the name
 
02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
okay and so the idea was when we
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
when we it's like grand families or the
 
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
legacy system used to be called bridges
 
02:35:18.710 --> 02:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
so what we're trying to do is use the
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
granite families as a branding
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
to say this is a new hampshire family
 
02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:23.990 align:start position:0%
to say this is a new hampshire family
system

02:35:23.990 --> 02:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
and then when it came to granite trace a
 
02:35:28.469 --> 02:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire contact tracing solution
 
02:35:30.950 --> 02:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
so not part of expanded medicaid that is
 
02:35:33.349 --> 02:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
not part of expanded medicaid
 
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so much about the hardware
 
02:35:37.990 --> 02:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
life cycle management
 
02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
how many ftes do you think are invested
 
02:35:41.990 --> 02:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
in that
 
02:35:44.870 --> 02:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
state employees and and then i assume
 
02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
that there's a fairly significant
 
02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
contract support there
 
02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
so depending on the the hardware itself
 
02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
um mr chair it would be
 
02:36:02.469 --> 02:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to distribution of
 
02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
computers we have
 
02:36:06.309 --> 02:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
several different teams from information
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
technology department
 
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
or do doit that are distributed across
 
02:36:14.469 --> 02:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
these the estate locations so we have
 
02:36:16.230 --> 02:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
some in our haze and drive some of
 
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
in our our brown building and some in
 
02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
other buildings across our campus
 
02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
and so i would identify as about nine
 
02:36:26.230 --> 02:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
people from
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
duit that helped us distribute those
 
02:36:28.319 --> 02:36:29.590 align:start position:0%
duit that helped us distribute those
devices

02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
devices
 
02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
and it included about another six
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
of our individuals within the department
 
02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
to get that done
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the cloud hosting
 
02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
solutions to reduce costs on the state
 
02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:43.190 align:start position:0%
solutions to reduce costs on the state
resources

02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
resources
 
02:36:46.389 --> 02:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
we we leveraged a contract with deloitte
 
02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
and it was funded fully funded by center
 
02:36:50.469 --> 02:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
for disease control and prevention
 
02:36:54.309 --> 02:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
funds to essentially
 
02:36:56.630 --> 02:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
to implement a cloud hosting solution
 
02:36:58.710 --> 02:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
for our public-facing
 
02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
business intelligence reports and then
 
02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
database hardware and
 
02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
the associated like server storage and
 
02:37:10.710 --> 02:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
networking equipment
 
02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
it was a mix between byt professionals
 
02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
as well as we also leveraged the funding
 
02:37:18.630 --> 02:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
from center
 
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
center for disease control and
 
02:37:22.469 --> 02:37:22.479 align:start position:0%
prevention to upgrade our hardware on
 
02:37:24.790 --> 02:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
premise or on site in our data center
 
02:37:26.550 --> 02:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
managed by department of information
 
02:37:26.560 --> 02:37:27.910 align:start position:0%
managed by department of information
technology

02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
technology
 
02:37:30.790 --> 02:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
to enhance the performance as well as
 
02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
include the storage necessary
 
02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
to bring in all the different data
 
02:37:37.750 --> 02:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
sources related to not only the
 
02:37:39.990 --> 02:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
the cova 19 pandemic but the opioid
 
02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
crisis as
 
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
was referred to earlier in meredith
 
02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:44.070 align:start position:0%
was referred to earlier in meredith
those

02:37:44.070 --> 02:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
presentation on the opioid crisis
 
02:37:46.479 --> 02:37:49.110 align:start position:0%
presentation on the opioid crisis
dashboard

02:37:49.110 --> 02:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
did that okay so well it does but it was
 
02:37:53.830 --> 02:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
kind of i'm what i'm really trying to
 
02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
get at here
 
02:37:58.230 --> 02:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
is is this feels like an area that isn't
 
02:37:58.240 --> 02:37:59.590 align:start position:0%
is is this feels like an area that isn't
necessarily

02:37:59.590 --> 02:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:38:03.670 --> 02:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
um a value-added service
 
02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's not part of dhhs core competency
 
02:38:10.710 --> 02:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
and um and i'm just wondering if
 
02:38:13.429 --> 02:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
um if there's any strategic thinking
 
02:38:13.990 --> 02:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
going on
 
02:38:17.110 --> 02:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
in this area to to rely more on
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh contract support so that the
 
02:38:24.550 --> 02:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
the few uh professionals that we do have
 
02:38:27.750 --> 02:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
with a 33 percent gap there
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
that we maybe can reallocate them to the
 
02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
value add
 
02:38:35.590 --> 02:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
business analyst kind of positions
 
02:38:37.830 --> 02:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
and and we can take that offline because
 
02:38:39.670 --> 02:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's a whole different discussion
 
02:38:42.790 --> 02:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
i i just would like to know if doit and
 
02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:44.469 align:start position:0%
i i just would like to know if doit and
dhhs

02:38:44.469 --> 02:38:44.479 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
02:38:48.070 --> 02:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
are thinking about redoing hardware
 
02:38:50.389 --> 02:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
lifecycle management differently in the
 
02:38:50.399 --> 02:38:51.510 align:start position:0%
lifecycle management differently in the
future

02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
we mr chair we certainly have had those
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
discussions in
 
02:38:57.190 --> 02:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
in this this whole slide really is
 
02:38:57.200 --> 02:38:58.150 align:start position:0%
in this this whole slide really is
operated

02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
operated
 
02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
by one person we have a senior senior
 
02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
i.t asset manager
 
02:39:05.190 --> 02:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
that is responsible for the application
 
02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
in the hardware lifecycle management
 
02:39:08.070 --> 02:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
along with myself
 
02:39:10.469 --> 02:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
and the deputy director so there really
 
02:39:12.710 --> 02:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be too much reassigning
 
02:39:15.270 --> 02:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
available and that person works hand in
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
hand with the duit professionals helping
 
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
to deploy the hardware
 
02:39:21.349 --> 02:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
and and and the vendors deploying the
 
02:39:23.429 --> 02:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
soft the applications
 
02:39:26.630 --> 02:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
um but when it comes to strategies in
 
02:39:28.389 --> 02:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
terms of like leasing equipment getting
 
02:39:30.550 --> 02:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
a contractor to do deployments
 
02:39:34.230 --> 02:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
and eliminating the the resources
 
02:39:37.270 --> 02:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
on on the ground that are supporting
 
02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
our our agency on a day-to-day basis we
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
certainly are having those discussions
 
02:39:43.270 --> 02:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
with uoit on a regular
 
02:39:45.990 --> 02:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
um i would say monthly basis to decide
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
how we move that forward
 
02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
i would be looking to commissioner
 
02:39:50.710 --> 02:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
goulet to see what his strategic
 
02:39:52.469 --> 02:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
direction would be on that
 
02:39:57.510 --> 02:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:01.349 --> 02:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
pardon me so sorry for all the text
 
02:40:03.510 --> 02:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
but some of our key accomplishments we
 
02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
already sort of
 
02:40:07.429 --> 02:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
addressed but in the enterprise business
 
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
intelligence platform
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
we were able to implement public-facing
 
02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
covid 19 pandemic
 
02:40:16.389 --> 02:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
response dashboards we have an opioid
 
02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
crisis response dashboard that is ready
 
02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
for the public but has not been
 
02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
published yet
 
02:40:24.070 --> 02:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
but we are planning to publish it soon
 
02:40:27.269 --> 02:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
and then internally we were
 
02:40:29.349 --> 02:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to evolve the master
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
client index which
 
02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
right now as of today integrates several
 
02:40:35.429 --> 02:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
of our different systems as i referred
 
02:40:37.190 --> 02:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
to earlier the child support system
 
02:40:39.510 --> 02:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
child welfare information system
 
02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
elderly adult care medicaid and
 
02:40:43.750 --> 02:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
integrated eligibility but our goal is
 
02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
to expand that
 
02:40:47.349 --> 02:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
and to include our behavioral health
 
02:40:49.190 --> 02:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
system which is now landed
 
02:40:51.990 --> 02:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
or is present in our data warehousing
 
02:40:54.790 --> 02:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
environment but is not integrated at a
 
02:40:58.550 --> 02:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
at a client level as well as
 
02:41:00.230 --> 02:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
other public health and new hampshire
 
02:41:03.349 --> 02:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
hospital systems as we go forward
 
02:41:05.990 --> 02:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
we also were able to create that
 
02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
scalable infrastructure for the the
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
dashboards that are being currently used
 
02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:10.630 align:start position:0%
dashboards that are being currently used
across

02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
across
 
02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
all divisions within the department in
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
that system
 
02:41:18.550 --> 02:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
as a result of funding from grants was
 
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
able to be expanded for the next
 
02:41:23.590 --> 02:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
year to two years and our goal is
 
02:41:26.870 --> 02:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
through a capital request to continue to
 
02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:27.269 align:start position:0%
through a capital request to continue to
fund

02:41:27.269 --> 02:41:27.279 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:41:32.070 --> 02:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
that security and awareness
 
02:41:34.309 --> 02:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the chief
 
02:41:37.269 --> 02:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
information security officer doit
 
02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
successfully implemented a
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
department-wide training and awareness
 
02:41:42.389 --> 02:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
program this past january
 
02:41:45.670 --> 02:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
and we're also streamlining contract
 
02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
processes for security and privacy by
 
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
creating templates
 
02:41:51.030 --> 02:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
that are have been vetted by multiple
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
vendors as well as
 
02:41:55.590 --> 02:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
throughout our department doit and the
 
02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
02:42:00.309 --> 02:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
to be compliant with our federal federal
 
02:42:01.750 --> 02:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
and state policies
 
02:42:05.110 --> 02:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
and legislation and
 
02:42:08.550 --> 02:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
then we also in terms of data
 
02:42:10.710 --> 02:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
data management we implemented data
 
02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
classification policy
 
02:42:13.910 --> 02:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
so that we could track what data is
 
02:42:15.269 --> 02:42:15.279 align:start position:0%
allowed to be shared
 
02:42:17.750 --> 02:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
shared at different levels and what kind
 
02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
of governance needs to be addressed for
 
02:42:20.550 --> 02:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
each one
 
02:42:23.269 --> 02:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
this was critical for privacy management
 
02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
02:42:27.349 --> 02:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we can see what who has
 
02:42:28.870 --> 02:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
access to what and when
 
02:42:32.230 --> 02:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
and why so that whenever anyone asks us
 
02:42:33.990 --> 02:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
why are we sharing this data this is how
 
02:42:35.510 --> 02:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're sharing it and this is the laws
 
02:42:36.950 --> 02:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
that allow us to share it
 
02:42:40.630 --> 02:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
in one for example we managed to met
 
02:42:42.309 --> 02:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
auditing requirements associated with
 
02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
federal different
 
02:42:46.550 --> 02:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
with several different audit auditing
 
02:42:48.389 --> 02:42:48.399 align:start position:0%
agencies listed there
 
02:42:50.309 --> 02:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
and then from interoperability and
 
02:42:52.950 --> 02:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
integration perspective
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
we we deployed those departmental case
 
02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
management systems
 
02:42:58.630 --> 02:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
so that we could rapidly respond to the
 
02:42:58.640 --> 02:42:59.510 align:start position:0%
so that we could rapidly respond to the
needs

02:42:59.510 --> 02:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
needs
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
um had we not started that initiative on
 
02:43:03.590 --> 02:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
this biennium at the beginning of this
 
02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:04.389 align:start position:0%
this biennium at the beginning of this
biennium

02:43:04.389 --> 02:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:43:06.309 --> 02:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
currently we would not have been able to
 
02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of contact tracing
 
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
child child care licensing and registry
 
02:43:14.309 --> 02:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
quality assurance components as well as
 
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's office case management
 
02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:17.750 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's office case management
processing

02:43:17.750 --> 02:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
processing
 
02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
that was a key success for our
 
02:43:20.790 --> 02:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
department to be
 
02:43:23.349 --> 02:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
able to move those systems forward in
 
02:43:25.190 --> 02:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
months as opposed to years
 
02:43:29.030 --> 02:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
and sometimes weeks in some cases weeks
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
the grant trace solution was implemented
 
02:43:32.710 --> 02:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
over a weekend it took us
 
02:43:35.110 --> 02:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
four business days to get in when i say
 
02:43:36.870 --> 02:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
four business days friday saturday
 
02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
sunday and monday
 
02:43:42.389 --> 02:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:45.670 --> 02:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
and then we at the end of the calendar
 
02:43:46.870 --> 02:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
year of 2020
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
we did implement the closed loop
 
02:43:50.469 --> 02:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
referral system which is gold at
 
02:43:52.550 --> 02:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
improving our care coordination between
 
02:43:55.830 --> 02:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
our providers of our state
 
02:43:57.750 --> 02:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
and then the final component here is
 
02:43:59.349 --> 02:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
system stabilizations
 
02:44:02.309 --> 02:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
so we're working on a strategic plans
 
02:44:03.349 --> 02:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
02:44:05.030 --> 02:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
we started with the medicaid enterprise
 
02:44:06.389 --> 02:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
strategic plan
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
which is a five-year plan addressing all
 
02:44:10.790 --> 02:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
the components of the medicaid
 
02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:12.630 align:start position:0%
the components of the medicaid
enterprise

02:44:12.630 --> 02:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
enterprise
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
as well as organizational information
 
02:44:16.469 --> 02:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
services strategic plan which
 
02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
is representative in the agency
 
02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
information technology plan that
 
02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of dyt publishes
 
02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
and then we have a portfolio of our
 
02:44:28.950 --> 02:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
projects which is we average about 120
 
02:44:31.190 --> 02:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
active projects at any given time
 
02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
and as a result of having a small staff
 
02:44:36.870 --> 02:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
we usually complete anywhere from 20 to
 
02:44:40.950 --> 02:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:42.550 --> 02:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
i want to i want to step in here and
 
02:44:45.910 --> 02:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
brag on you guys for a little bit
 
02:44:49.349 --> 02:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
we went uh for most of the year
 
02:44:52.790 --> 02:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
2000s with one strategic plan that never
 
02:44:54.309 --> 02:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
got updated
 
02:44:57.269 --> 02:44:57.279 align:start position:0%
and now it seems to me like you are with
 
02:44:57.279 --> 02:44:58.790 align:start position:0%
and now it seems to me like you are with
doit

02:44:58.790 --> 02:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
doit
 
02:45:01.030 --> 02:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
in a regular rhythm of doing strategic
 
02:45:02.550 --> 02:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
planning and updating it
 
02:45:05.510 --> 02:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
and that is a huge step forward i think
 
02:45:06.150 --> 02:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
in our
 
02:45:08.230 --> 02:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
in your profes in the professionalism of
 
02:45:09.269 --> 02:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
the effort
 
02:45:11.910 --> 02:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
and and the benefit that the state will
 
02:45:13.349 --> 02:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
get out of that so
 
02:45:15.910 --> 02:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to highlight that from
 
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
what i've seen
 
02:45:21.269 --> 02:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
you guys are really doing a a great job
 
02:45:24.550 --> 02:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
in the strategic planning area
 
02:45:27.910 --> 02:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair now i want
 
02:45:29.349 --> 02:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
to come back to something though because
 
02:45:30.950 --> 02:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
i said something good now i have to go
 
02:45:31.590 --> 02:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
the other way
 
02:45:34.710 --> 02:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
keep it balanced so i i see that
 
02:45:37.269 --> 02:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
you've got security and awareness and
 
02:45:38.309 --> 02:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
you got the
 
02:45:41.349 --> 02:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
payment card industry listed there and
 
02:45:43.990 --> 02:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i think we have an audit outstanding
 
02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:44.710 align:start position:0%
and i think we have an audit outstanding
where

02:45:44.710 --> 02:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
we have some serious problems with our
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
pci standards
 
02:45:52.070 --> 02:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh are we are you aware of that audit
 
02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
and are we at the point where we need to
 
02:45:56.070 --> 02:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
remove permissions
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:03.349 --> 02:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
mr chair i i am aware of an audit
 
02:46:04.469 --> 02:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
regarding the
 
02:46:07.429 --> 02:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
payment card industry of our of our
 
02:46:08.550 --> 02:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
state systems
 
02:46:11.429 --> 02:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
we are peripherally involved as a as a
 
02:46:13.670 --> 02:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
supporting agency with department of
 
02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
administrative services which is the
 
02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
lead agency i believe
 
02:46:20.230 --> 02:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
on that audit i don't believe we need to
 
02:46:20.240 --> 02:46:20.790 align:start position:0%
on that audit i don't believe we need to
remove

02:46:20.790 --> 02:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
remove
 
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
access because we did implement a new
 
02:46:26.710 --> 02:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
contract as a result of some of those
 
02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:28.309 align:start position:0%
contract as a result of some of those
audit

02:46:28.309 --> 02:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
audit
 
02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
issues and i believe we're going to be
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
able to address any
 
02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
any concerns regarding the sharing of
 
02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
credit card information
 
02:46:38.309 --> 02:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
but i would i would leave the the
 
02:46:39.269 --> 02:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
official answer
 
02:46:43.110 --> 02:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
to commissioner arlinghaus um to address
 
02:46:45.429 --> 02:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
it as needed if and i believe that's
 
02:46:45.439 --> 02:46:46.630 align:start position:0%
it as needed if and i believe that's
where

02:46:46.630 --> 02:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:46:48.389 --> 02:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
the lead agency is on that but i can
 
02:46:50.389 --> 02:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
follow up on you on that
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
for you if you if you would like uh
 
02:46:55.990 --> 02:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
i would uh and i don't have direct
 
02:46:59.429 --> 02:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
contact with commissioner arlingham
 
02:47:03.750 --> 02:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
but having having pci problems is uh
 
02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
you know concerns me just
 
02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead it's a it's a concern for us as
 
02:47:18.950 --> 02:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:22.950 --> 02:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
so key challenges for the organization
 
02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
again um the main main challenges here
 
02:47:29.429 --> 02:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
are lack of interoperability between our
 
02:47:31.110 --> 02:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
systems and integration we've made
 
02:47:32.469 --> 02:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
headway on those
 
02:47:34.469 --> 02:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
on those challenges but we need to
 
02:47:37.110 --> 02:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
continue our efforts
 
02:47:39.429 --> 02:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
the reason why is that not having
 
02:47:41.510 --> 02:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
integration and interoperability between
 
02:47:41.520 --> 02:47:42.870 align:start position:0%
integration and interoperability between
systems

02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
lends itself to duplication of effort
 
02:47:46.309 --> 02:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
wasted time
 
02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
on solutions they've already been
 
02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
thought through
 
02:47:52.309 --> 02:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
and strategically addressed and it
 
02:47:54.389 --> 02:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
really takes resources away from their
 
02:47:55.190 --> 02:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
comment their
 
02:47:58.469 --> 02:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
their true intention of the of the
 
02:48:02.710 --> 02:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
role which is client services and so
 
02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
the goal here is to continue to evolve
 
02:48:09.429 --> 02:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
our systems of record of our technology
 
02:48:09.439 --> 02:48:10.150 align:start position:0%
our systems of record of our technology
systems

02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:48:12.309 --> 02:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
to make to make them interoperable where
 
02:48:13.990 --> 02:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
we can
 
02:48:16.230 --> 02:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
to work with the legislature to identify
 
02:48:17.030 --> 02:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
ways in which
 
02:48:21.190 --> 02:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
um the legislation may or may not be
 
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
impacting the ability to do that and
 
02:48:24.240 --> 02:48:25.349 align:start position:0%
impacting the ability to do that and
then

02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:48:27.429 --> 02:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
having that overall overarching
 
02:48:29.030 --> 02:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
strategic plan of how we're going to get
 
02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:31.190 align:start position:0%
strategic plan of how we're going to get
there

02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:48:34.710 --> 02:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
additionally there's a lack of funding
 
02:48:36.469 --> 02:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
and you'll hear this throughout all of
 
02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
the different
 
02:48:40.309 --> 02:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
all of our different bureaus is we have
 
02:48:41.590 --> 02:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance on
 
02:48:44.710 --> 02:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
many of our systems and in some cases
 
02:48:46.469 --> 02:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
due to the deferred maintenance it did
 
02:48:48.389 --> 02:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
not mean that we weren't able to
 
02:48:50.630 --> 02:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
we didn't have to provide the services
 
02:48:52.150 --> 02:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
it meant that we had to go through
 
02:48:53.349 --> 02:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
manual workarounds
 
02:48:55.349 --> 02:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
either creating spreadsheets access
 
02:48:55.359 --> 02:48:56.550 align:start position:0%
either creating spreadsheets access
databases

02:48:56.550 --> 02:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
databases
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
or other smaller systems that are prone
 
02:49:00.070 --> 02:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
to error
 
02:49:03.190 --> 02:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
and can cause actual more work
 
02:49:05.910 --> 02:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
in the long run and reduced reduced
 
02:49:08.309 --> 02:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
services as a result
 
02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
the continuous loop of lack of
 
02:49:12.630 --> 02:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
technology to support our employee
 
02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:13.429 align:start position:0%
technology to support our employee
employees

02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:49:15.190 --> 02:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
have has resulted in these manual
 
02:49:17.429 --> 02:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
workarounds and
 
02:49:20.389 --> 02:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
what what my goal is is to work with the
 
02:49:22.230 --> 02:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
different teams across
 
02:49:24.550 --> 02:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
the department as well as hand in hand
 
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
with department of information
 
02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:27.030 align:start position:0%
with department of information
technology

02:49:27.030 --> 02:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
technology
 
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
to identify those systems and provide
 
02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
an operational as well as capital
 
02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
approach to replacing those systems
 
02:49:37.750 --> 02:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
over time in a strategic way
 
02:49:42.309 --> 02:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
and then the final component is
 
02:49:45.590 --> 02:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
information services team
 
02:49:48.630 --> 02:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
not only in in my bureau
 
02:49:50.469 --> 02:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
but also the ones embedded in different
 
02:49:51.830 --> 02:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
areas of the organization
 
02:49:55.190 --> 02:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
is is severely um
 
02:49:58.469 --> 02:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
this severely under resourced so
 
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
on a rolling average we support 120
 
02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:01.910 align:start position:0%
on a rolling average we support 120
projects

02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
projects
 
02:50:04.630 --> 02:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
we're only able to really get 30
 
02:50:06.309 --> 02:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
projects done
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
each year so that leaves 90 projects
 
02:50:10.630 --> 02:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
that don't get touched
 
02:50:13.590 --> 02:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
year over year which results in
 
02:50:15.990 --> 02:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
continuous workarounds and failures to
 
02:50:18.870 --> 02:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
meet our citizen services
 
02:50:21.910 --> 02:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
our goal would be to look at the
 
02:50:24.309 --> 02:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
different areas within the department
 
02:50:26.469 --> 02:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
and identify ways in which to expand
 
02:50:28.070 --> 02:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
those information services teams and
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
when i say information services
 
02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
business analysts that really drive
 
02:50:34.830 --> 02:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
what what are the needs of the
 
02:50:37.349 --> 02:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
organization how do we translate those
 
02:50:39.190 --> 02:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
into technology solutions if there is
 
02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:39.910 align:start position:0%
into technology solutions if there is
one

02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
and really support business process
 
02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:42.950 align:start position:0%
and really support business process
management

02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
management
 
02:50:45.510 --> 02:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair i believe you have a question i
 
02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:46.150 align:start position:0%
mr chair i believe you have a question i
do

02:50:46.150 --> 02:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:50:49.670 --> 02:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know uh if you're aware
 
02:50:53.190 --> 02:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
of any industry benchmarks
 
02:50:55.590 --> 02:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
that that you that would be relevant to
 
02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:56.710 align:start position:0%
that that you that would be relevant to
suggesting

02:50:56.710 --> 02:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
02:50:59.030 --> 02:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
what your appropriate staffing level
 
02:51:01.269 --> 02:51:01.279 align:start position:0%
might be
 
02:51:03.110 --> 02:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
so and i can't remember the exact
 
02:51:04.710 --> 02:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
website but i was doing i
 
02:51:06.950 --> 02:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
i've been listening to some of your
 
02:51:09.110 --> 02:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
questions of of my peers
 
02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
and there are different benchmarks that
 
02:51:13.190 --> 02:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
we probably should research
 
02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
more that would say for for project man
 
02:51:18.870 --> 02:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
for project management it would be
 
02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
anywhere from one to ten or one to
 
02:51:22.710 --> 02:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
twenty projects four pm
 
02:51:25.110 --> 02:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of the project so
 
02:51:26.870 --> 02:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
if you have a very large project like
 
02:51:28.150 --> 02:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
the mmis
 
02:51:30.790 --> 02:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
or medicaid system you probably wanna
 
02:51:31.990 --> 02:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
dedicate resources
 
02:51:33.590 --> 02:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
to that so that they're not getting
 
02:51:35.830 --> 02:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
distracted on other systems
 
02:51:38.870 --> 02:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
so so let's let's just abbreviate it and
 
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
say that
 
02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
let's talk in the future about external
 
02:51:42.870 --> 02:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
benchmarks as
 
02:51:45.269 --> 02:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
you as you learn more about it and get
 
02:51:45.990 --> 02:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
and get some good
 
02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:49.269 align:start position:0%
and get some good
examples

02:51:49.269 --> 02:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:50.870 --> 02:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
and the other benchmarks that we were
 
02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
looking at is how many technologies per
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
employee and so a lot of those are
 
02:51:57.670 --> 02:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
usually at the like
 
02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
the organization level so if we have ten
 
02:52:01.990 --> 02:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
thousand or three thousand
 
02:52:04.469 --> 02:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
three hundred right so i'd be concerned
 
02:52:05.349 --> 02:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
about even
 
02:52:07.910 --> 02:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
counting those right because how do
 
02:52:09.590 --> 02:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
unless they have an additional job
 
02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:10.630 align:start position:0%
unless they have an additional job
identifier

02:52:10.630 --> 02:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
identifier
 
02:52:13.429 --> 02:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
that is an additional duty that they do
 
02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
they would just
 
02:52:17.510 --> 02:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
be buried in into the into the
 
02:52:20.870 --> 02:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
weeds of each department so
 
02:52:24.790 --> 02:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
um but all right i
 
02:52:28.150 --> 02:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
i i feel your pain i've been here
 
02:52:31.670 --> 02:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
02:52:33.190 --> 02:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
we can keep going unless there are any
 
02:52:34.950 --> 02:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
questions oh there's one
 
02:52:34.960 --> 02:52:38.630 align:start position:0%
questions oh there's one
representative

02:52:38.630 --> 02:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:42.469 --> 02:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
thank you so you mentioned before
 
02:52:44.309 --> 02:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
i'm surprised it doesn't show up on your
 
02:52:45.830 --> 02:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
key challenges
 
02:52:48.950 --> 02:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
um that you have been down 30
 
02:52:52.070 --> 02:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
you're down 33 of your staff you're down
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
a third
 
02:52:55.349 --> 02:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
that seems to me like a pretty big
 
02:52:55.359 --> 02:52:56.950 align:start position:0%
that seems to me like a pretty big
challenge

02:52:56.950 --> 02:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
02:52:59.110 --> 02:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
and what i'm wondering is how long have
 
02:53:00.389 --> 02:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
you been
 
02:53:03.750 --> 02:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
down that many staff
 
02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
and what
 
02:53:09.990 --> 02:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
what do you think attributes to that is
 
02:53:12.870 --> 02:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
that that you can't hire people in this
 
02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:13.510 align:start position:0%
that that you can't hire people in this
area

02:53:13.510 --> 02:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:53:16.550 --> 02:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
or that the wages are
 
02:53:18.710 --> 02:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
out of sync with the private sector what
 
02:53:19.990 --> 02:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
what attributes
 
02:53:23.590 --> 02:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
to such a high term such a high rate of
 
02:53:27.190 --> 02:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
vacancy certainly thank you for the
 
02:53:29.269 --> 02:53:29.279 align:start position:0%
question representative walner and mr
 
02:53:29.279 --> 02:53:30.389 align:start position:0%
question representative walner and mr
chair

02:53:30.389 --> 02:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
so you're right this third bucket here
 
02:53:35.269 --> 02:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
of information services the resources
 
02:53:38.309 --> 02:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
is a huge constraint and our 33 vacancy
 
02:53:38.319 --> 02:53:38.870 align:start position:0%
is a huge constraint and our 33 vacancy
rate

02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
rate
 
02:53:41.990 --> 02:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
has resulted in from retirements so
 
02:53:43.110 --> 02:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
02:53:44.630 --> 02:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
two retirements in the project
 
02:53:46.389 --> 02:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
management office
 
02:53:49.110 --> 02:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
um and then we had a retirement as well
 
02:53:51.030 --> 02:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
in the information services
 
02:53:53.510 --> 02:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
and then we also had two people leave
 
02:53:55.510 --> 02:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
the state to go to private sector
 
02:53:58.550 --> 02:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
in and those and those people moved
 
02:54:00.070 --> 02:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
on because they were able to double
 
02:54:01.990 --> 02:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
their salaries as a result
 
02:54:04.790 --> 02:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
so it was a very easy decision for them
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
to make where they're saying
 
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
we can do the same job or less work
 
02:54:13.190 --> 02:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
and make more money so it is a challenge
 
02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
government as a as a rule is not always
 
02:54:19.110 --> 02:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
competitive with the private sector
 
02:54:22.790 --> 02:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
however i would say being within
 
02:54:25.830 --> 02:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
15 to 25 of the private sector would be
 
02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
a good goal to attain
 
02:54:30.550 --> 02:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
right now we're probably closer to 40 to
 
02:54:32.550 --> 02:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
50 percent less than the private sector
 
02:54:34.469 --> 02:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
which makes it
 
02:54:36.070 --> 02:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
the pool of people that we're looking
 
02:54:37.990 --> 02:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
for are either people that are
 
02:54:40.070 --> 02:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
just getting into the field and need to
 
02:54:41.349 --> 02:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
be trained
 
02:54:43.910 --> 02:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
or they made their they made their
 
02:54:46.070 --> 02:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
career in the private sector and now are
 
02:54:49.269 --> 02:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
retiring to come to our organization
 
02:54:51.910 --> 02:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
to support as a public servant so those
 
02:54:52.550 --> 02:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
are our main
 
02:54:54.950 --> 02:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
tools of resources that apply for
 
02:54:54.960 --> 02:54:56.150 align:start position:0%
tools of resources that apply for
positions

02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:54:59.429 --> 02:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
and in in a lot of cases it's really
 
02:55:01.510 --> 02:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial to get those people that have
 
02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
30 40 years of experience
 
02:55:06.469 --> 02:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
however it results in an attrition rate
 
02:55:08.150 --> 02:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
at a much higher rate because they come
 
02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
for a few years
 
02:55:11.750 --> 02:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
and then they leave because they've
 
02:55:13.830 --> 02:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
already retired from one career
 
02:55:16.150 --> 02:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
and then they're coming here to try to
 
02:55:17.910 --> 02:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
offer their services but they're not
 
02:55:20.630 --> 02:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
here for a long term
 
02:55:23.110 --> 02:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
so our goal when working with human
 
02:55:23.120 --> 02:55:23.830 align:start position:0%
so our goal when working with human
resources

02:55:23.830 --> 02:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
resources
 
02:55:27.590 --> 02:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
is to address this attrition and this
 
02:55:31.349 --> 02:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
this recruitment um opportunity
 
02:55:34.150 --> 02:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
and we can't necessarily always impact
 
02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:34.550 align:start position:0%
and we can't necessarily always impact
the

02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:55:37.349 --> 02:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
salaries of which we offer but we are
 
02:55:39.030 --> 02:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:55:41.190 --> 02:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
be more effective at our social media
 
02:55:43.269 --> 02:55:43.279 align:start position:0%

02:55:44.070 --> 02:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
02:55:46.070 --> 02:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of taking what we normally
 
02:55:47.830 --> 02:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
would just post out there which is a
 
02:55:50.070 --> 02:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
supplemental job description and making
 
02:55:51.510 --> 02:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
it a little bit more enticing
 
02:55:53.910 --> 02:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
of why you want to move to new hampshire
 
02:55:55.750 --> 02:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
or why do you want to work for new
 
02:55:58.550 --> 02:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
02:55:59.910 --> 02:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up representation
 
02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:01.030 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up representation
owner

02:56:01.030 --> 02:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
owner
 
02:56:06.309 --> 02:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:10.389 --> 02:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
had that many vacancies where your third
 
02:56:14.469 --> 02:56:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:18.230 --> 02:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
so the majority of the workforce
 
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
was full prior to the pandemic and then
 
02:56:23.429 --> 02:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
as a result of the pandemic and the
 
02:56:24.870 --> 02:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze we were
 
02:56:27.990 --> 02:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
we had people retire and and move on to
 
02:56:29.670 --> 02:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
other organizations
 
02:56:32.870 --> 02:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
um that resulted in vacancies
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
in this specific area
 
02:56:37.990 --> 02:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay i have if i could have one more
 
02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.230 align:start position:0%
okay i have if i could have one more
question

02:56:40.230 --> 02:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:56:42.230 --> 02:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay could you talk just for a minute i
 
02:56:44.150 --> 02:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
did notice on
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
your budget pages that you do have
 
02:56:50.870 --> 02:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
a very small amount of um funding for
 
02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:52.550 align:start position:0%
a very small amount of um funding for
overtime

02:56:52.550 --> 02:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
overtime
 
02:56:55.190 --> 02:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if you anticipate um
 
02:56:55.750 --> 02:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
that you're
 
02:56:59.750 --> 02:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to need to take a look at that
 
02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:00.230 align:start position:0%
going to need to take a look at that
line

02:57:00.230 --> 02:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:57:03.750 --> 02:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
because um i i'm just wondering how
 
02:57:04.790 --> 02:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
realistic is it
 
02:57:07.030 --> 02:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be able to build up
 
02:57:10.150 --> 02:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:12.150 --> 02:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
that quickly in the next in the next
 
02:57:13.750 --> 02:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
several months or even
 
02:57:15.670 --> 02:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
year i mean i think it would take a long
 
02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
time in this area to build up your
 
02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:20.469 align:start position:0%
time in this area to build up your
workforce

02:57:20.469 --> 02:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:21.510 --> 02:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:57:23.990 --> 02:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative wallner and mr chair
 
02:57:27.110 --> 02:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
the the overtime budget
 
02:57:30.389 --> 02:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
is primarily for a few key individuals
 
02:57:32.389 --> 02:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
i would say the majority of the
 
02:57:32.399 --> 02:57:33.830 align:start position:0%
i would say the majority of the
positions

02:57:33.830 --> 02:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
in the project management office are on
 
02:57:38.230 --> 02:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
classified salary positions
 
02:57:40.790 --> 02:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
as well as myself and two other
 
02:57:41.990 --> 02:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
positions information
 
02:57:43.590 --> 02:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
in the three other positions in the
 
02:57:45.910 --> 02:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
information services area so
 
02:57:48.550 --> 02:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
five positions in information services
 
02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
and one
 
02:57:53.190 --> 02:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
or two positions in gmo
 
02:57:56.309 --> 02:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
would be subject to that overtime and
 
02:57:59.830 --> 02:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:03.110 --> 02:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
cobit 19 response funding for the
 
02:58:04.150 --> 02:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
overtime because that's
 
02:58:05.910 --> 02:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
generally where the overtime is being
 
02:58:08.950 --> 02:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
hit and where we push
 
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
where where we're pushing overtime is
 
02:58:13.269 --> 02:58:13.279 align:start position:0%
into the program areas or the
 
02:58:14.950 --> 02:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
division areas where they have
 
02:58:16.630 --> 02:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
information services teams
 
02:58:19.030 --> 02:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
and they have larger overtime budgets to
 
02:58:20.469 --> 02:58:20.479 align:start position:0%
to accommodate that
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
so that that was our general approach
 
02:58:24.309 --> 02:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
but that
 
02:58:27.670 --> 02:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
that key the key indicator that
 
02:58:30.790 --> 02:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
is that we may have a difficulty
 
02:58:33.030 --> 02:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
remaining in that overtime budget in the
 
02:58:37.110 --> 02:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:40.550 --> 02:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you it seems like a big challenge
 
02:58:42.469 --> 02:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
let's do a time check here miss mr
 
02:58:45.030 --> 02:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
ripple after we complete this slide deck
 
02:58:46.389 --> 02:58:46.399 align:start position:0%
and do the the
 
02:58:49.590 --> 02:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
accounting um are we done for the day
 
02:58:52.710 --> 02:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
you are yes all right very good thank
 
02:58:52.720 --> 02:58:53.269 align:start position:0%
you are yes all right very good thank
you

02:58:53.269 --> 02:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:58:56.630 --> 02:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
i'll try to i'll try to go faster no
 
02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
i'm slowing you down i'm sure i i just
 
02:59:01.670 --> 02:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
um i need to provide testimony at 2 15.
 
02:59:01.680 --> 02:59:02.630 align:start position:0%
um i need to provide testimony at 2 15.
so

02:59:02.630 --> 02:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:59:05.590 --> 02:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh if i have to go then representative
 
02:59:06.950 --> 02:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
irf can
 
02:59:10.070 --> 02:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:11.830 --> 02:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
so one of the questions was what would
 
02:59:13.110 --> 02:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
we do
 
02:59:15.190 --> 02:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
with the two with five percent increase
 
02:59:16.309 --> 02:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
or five percent
 
02:59:19.510 --> 02:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
decrease um the increase would
 
02:59:21.670 --> 02:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
be reflected in about a two point two
 
02:59:22.950 --> 02:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
million dollar increase
 
02:59:25.429 --> 02:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
across the whole budget and the goal
 
02:59:27.190 --> 02:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
there would be to improve our care
 
02:59:28.309 --> 02:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
coordination in our
 
02:59:31.110 --> 02:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
in our integrated eligibility
 
02:59:31.120 --> 02:59:32.070 align:start position:0%
in our integrated eligibility
environment

02:59:32.070 --> 02:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
environment
 
02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
and so our integrated eligibility
 
02:59:35.750 --> 02:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
continues continues to evolve
 
02:59:38.150 --> 02:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
we submitted a capital project that was
 
02:59:39.750 --> 02:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
removed from
 
02:59:42.230 --> 02:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
from the the governor's office
 
02:59:42.240 --> 02:59:43.429 align:start position:0%
from the the governor's office
recommendation

02:59:43.429 --> 02:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
02:59:45.030 --> 02:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
that we still would need to be able to
 
02:59:48.230 --> 02:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:50.070 --> 02:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
expansions of that integrated
 
02:59:51.429 --> 02:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
eligibility function
 
02:59:53.030 --> 02:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
and that there's several different
 
02:59:55.349 --> 02:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
components self-service
 
02:59:57.590 --> 02:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
functionality to include ada
 
02:59:57.600 --> 02:59:58.710 align:start position:0%
functionality to include ada
accommodations

02:59:58.710 --> 02:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
accommodations
 
03:00:01.750 --> 03:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
as well as newer technology like chat
 
03:00:01.760 --> 03:00:02.389 align:start position:0%
as well as newer technology like chat
bots

03:00:02.389 --> 03:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
bots
 
03:00:05.269 --> 03:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
where they can address questions quickly
 
03:00:05.279 --> 03:00:05.830 align:start position:0%
where they can address questions quickly
and

03:00:05.830 --> 03:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:00:08.150 --> 03:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
numerous different enhancements to meet
 
03:00:09.110 --> 03:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
our are
 
03:00:10.790 --> 03:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
our service needs and the integrated
 
03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:12.389 align:start position:0%
our service needs and the integrated
eligibility

03:00:12.389 --> 03:00:12.399 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
additionally we would be looking to
 
03:00:15.990 --> 03:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
improve our our care
 
03:00:17.830 --> 03:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
our interoperability of systems and
 
03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
expansion of our state's
 
03:00:23.269 --> 03:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
systems like the closed loop referral so
 
03:00:25.269 --> 03:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
that we could expand into hospitals and
 
03:00:26.950 --> 03:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
then eventually into the managed care
 
03:00:26.960 --> 03:00:27.830 align:start position:0%
then eventually into the managed care
organizations

03:00:27.830 --> 03:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
03:00:29.990 --> 03:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
so that we would have a closed loop
 
03:00:31.349 --> 03:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
referral system which
 
03:00:34.469 --> 03:00:34.479 align:start position:0%
allows for a citizen to go
 
03:00:37.990 --> 03:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
to any any door and be able
 
03:00:41.830 --> 03:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
to consent to release their information
 
03:00:43.910 --> 03:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
if they so choose
 
03:00:46.389 --> 03:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
to be shared with say they were showing
 
03:00:47.190 --> 03:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
up at a
 
03:00:51.030 --> 03:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:53.349 --> 03:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
some sort of health related issue and
 
03:00:55.190 --> 03:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
they needed food services
 
03:00:56.550 --> 03:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
then they would be able to have that
 
03:00:58.389 --> 03:00:58.399 align:start position:0%
information released
 
03:01:00.309 --> 03:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
they would be consenting to that release
 
03:01:02.150 --> 03:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
of information and immediately be
 
03:01:04.830 --> 03:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
contacted by a food services
 
03:01:07.110 --> 03:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
organization and
 
03:01:09.030 --> 03:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
that would continue through if the food
 
03:01:11.030 --> 03:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
services saw other needs and services
 
03:01:12.070 --> 03:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
they would be able to be
 
03:01:15.110 --> 03:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
part of that common network
 
03:01:17.510 --> 03:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
if we saw a decrease that would have a
 
03:01:19.269 --> 03:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
severe impact on our operational
 
03:01:21.349 --> 03:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
capabilities to maintain our systems
 
03:01:23.269 --> 03:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
because we are pretty lean
 
03:01:26.150 --> 03:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
and the majority of our budget resides
 
03:01:28.790 --> 03:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
in the class 27 transfers to the office
 
03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:29.190 align:start position:0%
in the class 27 transfers to the office
of

03:01:29.190 --> 03:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:01:32.389 --> 03:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
information technology and that 2.2
 
03:01:33.990 --> 03:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
million dollar decrease would
 
03:01:35.990 --> 03:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
impact our ability to support the
 
03:01:37.830 --> 03:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility system
 
03:01:39.590 --> 03:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
it would also defer maintenance we would
 
03:01:41.429 --> 03:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
not be able to provide any
 
03:01:43.190 --> 03:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
replacement for computers in the next
 
03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:44.550 align:start position:0%
replacement for computers in the next
biennium

03:01:44.550 --> 03:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
03:01:47.750 --> 03:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
as well as that line line 27 transfers
 
03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:47.990 align:start position:0%
as well as that line line 27 transfers
to

03:01:47.990 --> 03:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:01:51.030 --> 03:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
oit is that what you're referring to
 
03:01:54.070 --> 03:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
that that would take the biggest hit yes
 
03:01:56.230 --> 03:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
mr chair it would we would have a choice
 
03:01:57.910 --> 03:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
i guess essentially between
 
03:02:01.830 --> 03:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
hitting that line or or laying off staff
 
03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:02.309 align:start position:0%
hitting that line or or laying off staff
yeah

03:02:02.309 --> 03:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:02:07.510 --> 03:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
and and so that oit that that's the doit
 
03:02:10.630 --> 03:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
that is correct mr chair so this
 
03:02:13.830 --> 03:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
class 27 is in in the information
 
03:02:15.190 --> 03:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
services budget is where
 
03:02:18.309 --> 03:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
all the transfers to infra department of
 
03:02:20.230 --> 03:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
information technology occurs for the
 
03:02:20.240 --> 03:02:21.110 align:start position:0%
information technology occurs for the
department

03:02:21.110 --> 03:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:02:23.269 --> 03:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
and it's where where we pay for those
 
03:02:24.870 --> 03:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
common services like email
 
03:02:27.349 --> 03:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
file services and we have web services
 
03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
but it also is where we pay for our
 
03:02:29.120 --> 03:02:29.590 align:start position:0%
but it also is where we pay for our
direct

03:02:29.590 --> 03:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
direct
 
03:02:32.710 --> 03:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
costs including like eligibility systems
 
03:02:35.990 --> 03:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
child support systems and general
 
03:02:36.790 --> 03:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
maintenance on
 
03:02:39.190 --> 03:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
everything that we do for an application
 
03:02:41.030 --> 03:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
so am i right to believe that
 
03:02:43.910 --> 03:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
that line has your deloitte money in it
 
03:02:45.030 --> 03:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:02:51.190 --> 03:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:53.990 --> 03:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
um from a contractual perspective mr
 
03:02:55.750 --> 03:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
chair i'm not exactly how it gets paid
 
03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
but yes
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
there are components of the class 27
 
03:03:01.030 --> 03:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
budget that does have the deloitte
 
03:03:04.150 --> 03:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
contract in it however we contract with
 
03:03:05.510 --> 03:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
deloitte for more than just the
 
03:03:07.190 --> 03:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
integrated eligibility system as you
 
03:03:08.550 --> 03:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
heard earlier today
 
03:03:10.710 --> 03:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
we also contract with them for our data
 
03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
warehousing and data analytics
 
03:03:15.510 --> 03:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
which is primarily not seeing a line
 
03:03:17.750 --> 03:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
item that's big enough for any contract
 
03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:18.389 align:start position:0%
item that's big enough for any contract
so

03:03:18.389 --> 03:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:03:20.469 --> 03:03:20.479 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that that's all your
 
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
contract transfers right there
 
03:03:24.950 --> 03:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
that is that is correct mr chair but
 
03:03:26.630 --> 03:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
there are some contract transfers that
 
03:03:28.630 --> 03:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
are within the program area specifically
 
03:03:30.950 --> 03:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
associated with grants
 
03:03:34.389 --> 03:03:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay so uh earlier today you may have
 
03:03:34.399 --> 03:03:34.790 align:start position:0%
okay so uh earlier today you may have
heard

03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
heard
 
03:03:38.710 --> 03:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
i uh suggested to ms telus
 
03:03:41.750 --> 03:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
to follow up with you to talk about uh
 
03:03:44.230 --> 03:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility the integrated eligibility i
 
03:03:45.750 --> 03:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
had forgotten you were three years
 
03:03:47.590 --> 03:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
downstream already
 
03:03:50.950 --> 03:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
but um but you know it sounds to me like
 
03:03:53.670 --> 03:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
like she could she could make dhhs some
 
03:03:53.680 --> 03:03:54.230 align:start position:0%
like she could she could make dhhs some
money

03:03:54.230 --> 03:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:03:56.950 --> 03:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
if uh if she were able to streamline her
 
03:03:59.830 --> 03:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility efforts
 
03:04:02.790 --> 03:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
certainly and and she her team and and i
 
03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:03.190 align:start position:0%
certainly and and she her team and and i
are

03:04:03.190 --> 03:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
in constant conversation and so
 
03:04:08.550 --> 03:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
that the is we we look at the third
 
03:04:10.710 --> 03:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
party liability and fraud voice abuse as
 
03:04:13.510 --> 03:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
part of the medicaid enterprise program
 
03:04:16.150 --> 03:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
because it would be funded 90 by federal
 
03:04:16.160 --> 03:04:16.630 align:start position:0%
because it would be funded 90 by federal
funds

03:04:16.630 --> 03:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:04:19.429 --> 03:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
to support and we didn't tie it directly
 
03:04:19.439 --> 03:04:19.750 align:start position:0%
to support and we didn't tie it directly
to

03:04:19.750 --> 03:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:04:22.469 --> 03:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
integrated eligibility itself we we
 
03:04:24.309 --> 03:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
currently have it in the
 
03:04:26.790 --> 03:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
mmis contract and we'll be looking to
 
03:04:28.630 --> 03:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
reprocure that solution
 
03:04:31.750 --> 03:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
in the next biennium and and work in
 
03:04:33.510 --> 03:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the enterprise business
 
03:04:36.389 --> 03:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
intelligence platform
 
03:04:40.469 --> 03:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative wallner
 
03:04:44.150 --> 03:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
you have a question your hands you do
 
03:04:47.269 --> 03:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
i yeah i do um so
 
03:04:51.269 --> 03:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
if i go to your
 
03:04:55.349 --> 03:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
source of revenue again i see
 
03:04:58.710 --> 03:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
the situation where the general fund
 
03:05:00.710 --> 03:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
is going up and the federal funds are
 
03:05:01.910 --> 03:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
going down
 
03:05:04.950 --> 03:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
is that just
 
03:05:08.790 --> 03:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
a formula that's being used that's
 
03:05:10.790 --> 03:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
causing that to happen or is that
 
03:05:13.590 --> 03:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
um is that really that there is a
 
03:05:13.600 --> 03:05:14.230 align:start position:0%
um is that really that there is a
difference

03:05:14.230 --> 03:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
difference
 
03:05:16.469 --> 03:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
in what the federal what the feds are
 
03:05:17.510 --> 03:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to um
 
03:05:20.630 --> 03:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
support dave i can jump in there if you
 
03:05:20.640 --> 03:05:21.830 align:start position:0%
support dave i can jump in there if you
want

03:05:21.830 --> 03:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
want
 
03:05:23.590 --> 03:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
that would be great so so while you're
 
03:05:25.269 --> 03:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
jumping in i'm going to ask
 
03:05:27.910 --> 03:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative irf to take over chairman
 
03:05:27.920 --> 03:05:28.630 align:start position:0%
representative irf to take over chairman
duties

03:05:28.630 --> 03:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
duties
 
03:05:31.510 --> 03:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
and uh and if you guys are gone when i
 
03:05:32.710 --> 03:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
come back
 
03:05:34.389 --> 03:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
have a wonderful day thank you for
 
03:05:36.389 --> 03:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
everything um
 
03:05:38.469 --> 03:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
and so i'm gonna i'm gonna step away for
 
03:05:41.510 --> 03:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you are you are you ready
 
03:05:46.550 --> 03:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative i am ready chairman mr
 
03:05:46.560 --> 03:05:50.469 align:start position:0%
representative i am ready chairman mr
chairman

03:05:50.469 --> 03:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:52.469 --> 03:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
okay so what you'll notice in that
 
03:05:55.750 --> 03:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
change from 1819 to 2021 is also the
 
03:05:55.760 --> 03:05:56.790 align:start position:0%
change from 1819 to 2021 is also the
total

03:05:56.790 --> 03:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
total
 
03:05:59.670 --> 03:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
amount of cost has decreased some and
 
03:05:59.680 --> 03:05:59.990 align:start position:0%
amount of cost has decreased some and
that

03:05:59.990 --> 03:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:06:03.110 --> 03:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
is mostly due to us moving mmis
 
03:06:05.269 --> 03:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
from the doit budget into the medicaid
 
03:06:06.309 --> 03:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
budget so
 
03:06:09.030 --> 03:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
those mmis is generally 90 10 sometimes
 
03:06:10.230 --> 03:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit less
 
03:06:13.190 --> 03:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
so the federal funds on that are the
 
03:06:14.469 --> 03:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
reason that the federal funds are
 
03:06:15.429 --> 03:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
decreasing there
 
03:06:17.510 --> 03:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're over in the um medicaid budget
 
03:06:17.520 --> 03:06:18.790 align:start position:0%
they're over in the um medicaid budget
now

03:06:18.790 --> 03:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:06:24.710 --> 03:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:28.150 --> 03:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
so i skipped over um this slide because
 
03:06:29.910 --> 03:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
we pretty much already covered it from
 
03:06:29.920 --> 03:06:30.870 align:start position:0%
we pretty much already covered it from
uh

03:06:30.870 --> 03:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
from a staffing perspective earlier in
 
03:06:35.269 --> 03:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
the conversation
 
03:06:38.630 --> 03:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
and then we just jumped into
 
03:06:41.429 --> 03:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
this this slide showing our funding
 
03:06:42.309 --> 03:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
changes over
 
03:06:45.030 --> 03:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
year over year or by name over biennium
 
03:06:46.790 --> 03:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
were there any other questions on
 
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:57.750 --> 03:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay so then from uh
 
03:06:59.590 --> 03:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
information services accounting unit
 
03:07:00.790 --> 03:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
perspective we
 
03:07:03.830 --> 03:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
i would turn it over to
 
03:07:07.269 --> 03:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
mrs rounds support me and i will
 
03:07:08.870 --> 03:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
certainly get involved when it comes to
 
03:07:12.469 --> 03:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:14.230 --> 03:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
all right if you want to stop screen
 
03:07:22.070 --> 03:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:25.349 --> 03:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
so we are on the last accounting unit
 
03:07:27.190 --> 03:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
for the office of the commissioner which
 
03:07:29.590 --> 03:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
is this one here in purple 5952
 
03:07:31.269 --> 03:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
information services
 
03:07:37.269 --> 03:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:40.070 --> 03:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
that starts on 1181 and continues on to
 
03:07:40.080 --> 03:07:41.510 align:start position:0%
that starts on 1181 and continues on to
11.82

03:07:41.510 --> 03:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
11.82
 
03:07:44.389 --> 03:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
the largest being the class 27 as we've
 
03:07:45.110 --> 03:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
03:07:50.870 --> 03:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:57.670 --> 03:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
i'll ask you a generic question if
 
03:07:59.590 --> 03:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
nobody else has one right now
 
03:08:01.110 --> 03:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
i noticed that you there was a pretty
 
03:08:03.590 --> 03:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
substantial increase in
 
03:08:05.110 --> 03:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
that in the last in the well and current
 
03:08:07.190 --> 03:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
year basically and yet there's still
 
03:08:08.790 --> 03:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
another pretty good increase not as good
 
03:08:08.800 --> 03:08:09.590 align:start position:0%
another pretty good increase not as good
obviously

03:08:09.590 --> 03:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
03:08:12.630 --> 03:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
in this current year is that typical
 
03:08:12.640 --> 03:08:13.269 align:start position:0%
in this current year is that typical
growth

03:08:13.269 --> 03:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
growth
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
i mean the 15 i'm hoping is out of range
 
03:08:18.309 --> 03:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
what is the four percent typical growth
 
03:08:19.750 --> 03:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
from the you're talking about the
 
03:08:21.830 --> 03:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
transfers to duit yeah i realized it's
 
03:08:23.110 --> 03:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
probably more of a division one
 
03:08:24.150 --> 03:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
question i thought maybe you would have
 
03:08:26.790 --> 03:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
some insight since you obviously
 
03:08:29.910 --> 03:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
fund a lot of it sure so i think and
 
03:08:31.670 --> 03:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
i'll let dave jump in here too
 
03:08:34.550 --> 03:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
the the largest thing here is is the
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
impact to covid
 
03:08:37.349 --> 03:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
and i think there were a lot of things
 
03:08:39.830 --> 03:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
that um didn't move forward
 
03:08:42.230 --> 03:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
or ended up being funded with coveted
 
03:08:42.240 --> 03:08:43.030 align:start position:0%
or ended up being funded with coveted
funds

03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:08:44.710 --> 03:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
um because of the nature that they ended
 
03:08:46.630 --> 03:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
up being that's really making that
 
03:08:48.150 --> 03:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
03:08:51.269 --> 03:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 dave do you have anything you
 
03:08:53.190 --> 03:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
want to add there
 
03:08:56.469 --> 03:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
that's certainly the component and for
 
03:08:59.349 --> 03:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
details the information department of
 
03:09:01.110 --> 03:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
information technology implemented a
 
03:09:01.120 --> 03:09:01.670 align:start position:0%
information technology implemented a
couple

03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
couple
 
03:09:04.870 --> 03:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
very large platforms and along with us
 
03:09:06.710 --> 03:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
which was the salesforce components
 
03:09:10.870 --> 03:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
as well as the microsoft m365 which is
 
03:09:12.469 --> 03:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
migrating us to the cloud
 
03:09:15.190 --> 03:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
for email and file services as well as
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
our ability to
 
03:09:19.990 --> 03:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
communicate with each other through a
 
03:09:22.309 --> 03:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
teleworking environment
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
those are the primary so the shared
 
03:09:26.070 --> 03:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
costs that
 
03:09:27.510 --> 03:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
that department of information
 
03:09:27.520 --> 03:09:29.590 align:start position:0%
that department of information
technology

03:09:29.590 --> 03:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
technology
 
03:09:32.630 --> 03:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
allocates to us increased primarily in
 
03:09:32.640 --> 03:09:33.030 align:start position:0%
allocates to us increased primarily in
that

03:09:33.030 --> 03:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
in that space our direct cost which is
 
03:09:36.870 --> 03:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
where our maintenance and operations of
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
our existing application systems and our
 
03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
computer hardware
 
03:09:44.630 --> 03:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
actually went down um and so
 
03:09:46.710 --> 03:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
as a relationship to those shared
 
03:09:49.269 --> 03:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
services increases so that five percent
 
03:09:53.590 --> 03:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
increase is mainly as rounds indicated
 
03:09:57.750 --> 03:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
um related to coveted response but also
 
03:09:59.830 --> 03:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
for a long-term perspective we need to
 
03:10:01.590 --> 03:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
maintain those systems
 
03:10:03.750 --> 03:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
so we needed to put the operating costs
 
03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
in in place to
 
03:10:07.990 --> 03:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
continue those services okay so i'm
 
03:10:08.870 --> 03:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
really asking is do
 
03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
you foresee that that growth has to
 
03:10:13.510 --> 03:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
continue to maintain your services
 
03:10:17.910 --> 03:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:21.190 --> 03:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
so a representative earth that that
 
03:10:23.429 --> 03:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
is not it's an annual cost to maintain
 
03:10:24.389 --> 03:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
those services
 
03:10:26.630 --> 03:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
um across those different systems until
 
03:10:28.469 --> 03:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
such time that we would
 
03:10:30.309 --> 03:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
we would turn them they would we would
 
03:10:32.710 --> 03:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
retire those systems so they
 
03:10:34.550 --> 03:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
when you when we moved to the platforms
 
03:10:36.150 --> 03:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh cloud platforms there's
 
03:10:38.070 --> 03:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
their software as a service platform so
 
03:10:39.510 --> 03:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
they basically are
 
03:10:41.990 --> 03:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
our annual costs now i understand the
 
03:10:43.590 --> 03:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
annual cost like what i'm looking at
 
03:10:46.710 --> 03:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
is the
 
03:10:48.389 --> 03:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
there's a big jump we just talked about
 
03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
15 in growth not not in
 
03:10:52.710 --> 03:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
so in other words increased dollars and
 
03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
it looks like in the first year
 
03:10:56.469 --> 03:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
of this proposed budget you've got
 
03:10:58.070 --> 03:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
another a little over four percent
 
03:11:00.229 --> 03:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
growth and then it dropped in it drops
 
03:11:01.110 --> 03:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
by half of that
 
03:11:02.630 --> 03:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking if that if you're
 
03:11:04.630 --> 03:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
anticipating that growth a growth rate
 
03:11:08.309 --> 03:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
to continue
 
03:11:09.910 --> 03:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's a good question representative
 
03:11:11.670 --> 03:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't understand the initial
 
03:11:15.349 --> 03:11:15.359 align:start position:0%
question so the the growth rate
 
03:11:17.510 --> 03:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
essentially would only continue based
 
03:11:19.269 --> 03:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
off of mandates that we
 
03:11:22.710 --> 03:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
we would receive so on a biennium basis
 
03:11:24.870 --> 03:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
they do receive different mandates to
 
03:11:26.070 --> 03:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
implement services
 
03:11:29.429 --> 03:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
in the middle of of the uh the biennium
 
03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
in in cases like center for disease
 
03:11:34.070 --> 03:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
control and prevention might may
 
03:11:35.910 --> 03:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
provide us a grant to implement a
 
03:11:37.429 --> 03:11:37.439 align:start position:0%
service or a solution
 
03:11:38.710 --> 03:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be required to
 
03:11:41.510 --> 03:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
maintain and but they'll only give us
 
03:11:43.670 --> 03:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
the one-time cost to start it up but not
 
03:11:44.870 --> 03:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
the annual cost to
 
03:11:47.269 --> 03:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
operate so i would anticipate that
 
03:11:47.279 --> 03:11:48.070 align:start position:0%
operate so i would anticipate that
growth

03:11:48.070 --> 03:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
growth
 
03:11:49.429 --> 03:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
being anywhere from three to five
 
03:11:51.830 --> 03:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
percent on a regular basis
 
03:11:59.910 --> 03:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:03.030 --> 03:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
i'm jay oh mom you didn't know can you
 
03:12:07.269 --> 03:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
hear me

she's gonna hear you i think she's my
 
03:12:08.479 --> 03:12:10.950 align:start position:0%
she's gonna hear you i think she's my
eyebrows

03:12:10.950 --> 03:12:10.960 align:start position:0%

can you hear me yeah yes yeah go ahead
 
03:12:17.750 --> 03:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes yes

yes okay sorry about that
 
03:12:24.150 --> 03:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
okay so in 2020
 
03:12:26.389 --> 03:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh this isn't just about this can you
 
03:12:27.429 --> 03:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
hear me now
 
03:12:31.510 --> 03:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
yes can you hear us can't hear earth
 
03:12:34.630 --> 03:12:34.640 align:start position:0%

03:12:45.269 --> 03:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
okay in 2020 you spent you had about 35
 
03:12:45.279 --> 03:12:50.070 align:start position:0%
okay in 2020 you spent you had about 35
million

03:12:50.070 --> 03:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:54.870 --> 03:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:57.910 --> 03:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
maybe it's your connection right
 
03:13:01.590 --> 03:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
you're freezing up
 
03:13:04.710 --> 03:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
we lost you mine
 
03:13:08.710 --> 03:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:12.950 --> 03:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:16.309 --> 03:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
yeah in 2021 it went up
 
03:13:19.910 --> 03:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
start over 40 million and that is
 
03:13:22.469 --> 03:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
because of covet that's what i just said
 
03:13:22.479 --> 03:13:23.030 align:start position:0%
because of covet that's what i just said
okay

03:13:23.030 --> 03:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:13:31.990 --> 03:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:34.550 --> 03:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
i texted her okay i think she's gonna
 
03:13:35.349 --> 03:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
log back in
 
03:13:36.550 --> 03:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any questions while
 
03:13:40.830 --> 03:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:44.950 --> 03:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
no if i can make some up
 
03:13:46.950 --> 03:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
f um could you just okay i'm back then
 
03:13:47.990 --> 03:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
is it any better
 
03:13:52.630 --> 03:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:00.070 --> 03:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:04.150 --> 03:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:05.269 --> 03:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
maybe she could relate a question
 
03:14:07.269 --> 03:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
through you sharon
 
03:14:13.429 --> 03:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:17.269 --> 03:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes
 
03:14:21.830 --> 03:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay so let's try again
 
03:14:25.990 --> 03:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
so you're up about you're up about five
 
03:14:29.750 --> 03:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars from 20 to 21
 
03:14:33.750 --> 03:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh additional five million
 
03:14:45.990 --> 03:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:51.990 --> 03:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's only gone we're doing so well
 
03:14:54.950 --> 03:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a signal we should quit never
 
03:14:54.960 --> 03:14:55.990 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a signal we should quit never
mind

03:14:55.990 --> 03:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
mind
 
03:15:02.790 --> 03:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:08.450 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:08.450 --> 03:15:11.269 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:15:11.269 --> 03:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:15:16.790 --> 03:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:19.349 --> 03:15:19.359 align:start position:0%
anything else you want to address karen
 
03:15:20.229 --> 03:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
i don't think so
 
03:15:22.469 --> 03:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
uh certainly if representative waldner
 
03:15:24.070 --> 03:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
wants to email her question
 
03:15:25.750 --> 03:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
through the lba have them add it to
 
03:15:27.990 --> 03:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
their question list we'll make sure to
 
03:15:31.030 --> 03:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
to get a response back um otherwise i
 
03:15:34.469 --> 03:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
i don't think i have anything to add
 
03:15:36.229 --> 03:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
if there are no other questions i would
 
03:15:38.309 --> 03:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
just say thank you to all my ocom
 
03:15:40.710 --> 03:15:40.720 align:start position:0%

and what are we doing tomorrow ken uh we
 
03:15:51.830 --> 03:15:51.840 align:start position:0%

and housing stability
 
03:15:55.429 --> 03:15:55.439 align:start position:0%

i will convert those um this afternoon
 
03:16:20.309 --> 03:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
and get those over
