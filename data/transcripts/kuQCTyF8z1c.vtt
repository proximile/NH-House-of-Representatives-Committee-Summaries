00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open up the public hearing uh
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 1583
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
and hear from the prime sponsor
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative hogan
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm representative
 
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
timothy oregon it represents stratfor
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
county district six um the towns of
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
durham and madbury and durham is in fact
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
one of the larger towns in the state
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
which does not have a state liquor store
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
even though
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
the private
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
location might be profitable thanks to
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
proximity to the university of new
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire but the uh madbury the lee
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
circle store is just like
 
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
a few minutes down route 4 so um
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
so if you need wine or spirits uh and
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
you have to be in durham it's not you
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
don't have to drive far to get them and
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
i'm uh
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
like all of us i'm sort of a shareholder
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire state liquor
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
outlets um
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
one of the 1.4 million or so
 
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
shareholders so i'm
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
not a large consumer of uh weiner
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
spirits but i do like want them to be uh
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
profitable which is what my bill is here
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
was too unnecessary and
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm arguably unconstitutional
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions on our state liquor stores
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
so it'd make them a little more
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
profitable by first of all by letting
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
them serve the public one more day a
 
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.270 align:start position:0%
them serve the public one more day a
year

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
and also by giving them a wider choice
 
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
of locations
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
so the stores will still close on
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
thanksgiving christmas but if this pass
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
the bill would eliminate the closure on
 
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
easter i mean i suppose they could close
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
on easter if they made a business
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
decision to do so but they wouldn't be
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
required to
 
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%
you know thanksgiving and east
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
thanksgiving and christmas are
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
well almost universally um observed on
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
dates which don't change from year to
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
year i mean there's a few people who for
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
one reason another refuse don't observe
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
those dates but um
 
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
um even though christmas the secular
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
christmas elise is always december 25th
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
although there are some religions who
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
celebrate christmas on some other day
 
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.350 align:start position:0%
celebrate christmas on some other day
um

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
thanksgiving is a pretty much well
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
purely secular holiday i mean i guess
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
insofar as you can never totally
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
separate church and state
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
um always observed on the fourth
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
thursday in november so
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
everybody knows when those are coming up
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
whereas easter somewhat differently
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
because it moves around the calendar
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
somewhat randomly i mean there is uh
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
and it's probably
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
only secondarily a secular holiday
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
although i'm a big fan of the easter
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
bunny and the gel easter eggs and all
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing but um
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
life not to get off into the weeds and i
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
don't dress as my written testimony but
 
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.590 align:start position:0%
don't dress as my written testimony but
basically

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
the holiday's supposed to be the first
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh sunday after the first full moon in
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
the spring but uh different churches
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
have different ways of calculating that
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's not the same as like when the
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
so-called astronomical easter is that's
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
why it
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
wanders all over the calendar like that
 
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.269 align:start position:0%
wanders all over the calendar like that
um

00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
so that's anyway the existing law
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
actually doesn't even give a definition
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
of easter though i guess they've been
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
closing on the so-called western easter
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
which is what the roman catholic church
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
and most mainstream protestant
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
churches observe but
 
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.790 align:start position:0%
churches observe but
and

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
then actually the more probably the more
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
the other thing which is probably a
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
little more significant is um
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
it eliminates the prohibition on
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
locating churches within 200
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
locating stores within 200 feet of a
 
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.590 align:start position:0%
locating stores within 200 feet of a
church

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
church
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
chapel or parish house
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
which well this is actually for for new
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
stores any existing stores that are
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
can stay in place um but
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission should be free to
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
locate the stores wherever the best
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
available location happens to be and you
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
know there is uh
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
there isn't necessarily a surplus of
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
good commercial real estate in the in
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
this in new hampshire
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
most of the
 
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.030 align:start position:0%
most of the
commission's

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
commission's
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
newer stores are freestanding i guess
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
they say big box my written test one
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
that's not quite what they are but
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
they're larger stores located on you
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
know fairly spacious lots with ample
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
parking and landscaping
 
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.509 align:start position:0%
parking and landscaping
um

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
so they don't and um the newer stores
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
also tend to be built on well-traveled
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
locations the outskirts of the town and
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
that's also where churches like to
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
locate new churches
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
so it's easy to imagine a situation when
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
existing churches property might have
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
but a desirable site for a state liquor
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
store and i think the commission should
 
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
be able to build stores at those sites
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
so they should basically have the same
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
rights as any other
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
retail tenant
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
also aside from
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
those stores you know sort of those
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
suburban locations on the
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
highways leading and out of town
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
such as for example
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
the one i might visit the most often is
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
the one on route 9 and summer's worth on
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
high street um
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
they um and they're still occasionally
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
building on strip malls like
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
the store that i mentioned which is
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
close to my home the lee outlet that's
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
built in a
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
strip mall and
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
which might have storefront churches as
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
tenants and also
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
also um there's still a place for state
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
liquor outlets in downtown locations
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
where all sorts of enterprises including
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
churches might exist within that 200
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
feet radius so i just think this is an
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
unnecessary restriction i don't
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
think there'll be a plethora of new
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
stores being built in churches because
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission is uh does like to
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
be a good neighbor and you know they
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
and they choose locations that don't
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
conflict with the other uses and
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
community but i don't think in every
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
case that is necessarily a bad thing for
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
a state liquor store to be next to a
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
church and certainly in any case they
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
in the property where they have the most
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
traffic going by which they can get for
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
the best price etc so they shouldn't be
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
when they're competing in the commercial
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
real estate market they shouldn't be
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
artificially bound by a restriction
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
which doesn't apply to any other
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
retailers so that's um
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
that's basically my bill and that's why
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
i introduced it and
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
great uh representative bartlett has a
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
question sure thank you mr chair um can
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
i just ask you what the motivation is
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
behind this i mean what decided what
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
made you decide to bring this forward
 
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.470 align:start position:0%
made you decide to bring this forward
um

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
well first of all
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
um well first of all it started there
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
was a thing with easter which doesn't
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
really have a set definition like
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
although i guess they go with what you
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
know the church churches do calculate
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
years in advance and um
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
i really can't explain how they picked
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
those particular sunday instead of
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
another and then also i just
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
felt like you know i don't
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
i don't i'm not a big drinker i don't
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
use that often but i think you know the
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
stores first should be in the best
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
location and their main job
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
is to make a profit for the state of new
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire and also just in general i'm
 
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.829 align:start position:0%
hampshire and also just in general i'm
somewhat

00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
dubious about giving churches
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
too many special privileges they've been
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
asking for a lot of them
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
lately i've been a judiciary for example
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
just dealing with um you know
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
whether churches should be uh you know
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
bound by emergency resolutions and i
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate what
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
churches do but i'm not sure if they
 
00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:32.710 align:start position:0%
churches do but i'm not sure if they
necessarily

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
not sure this particular protection and
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
of course not all churches even object
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
to being next to liquor stores most of
 
00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:39.750 align:start position:0%
to being next to liquor stores most of
them

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
most denominations do allow people doing
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
to certainly allow their
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
members to drink within reason and
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's somewhere even uh alcoholic
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
beverages are part of the uh part of the
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
ceremony so
 
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.310 align:start position:0%
ceremony so
thanks

00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
why aren't liquor stores permitted
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
within 200 feet of a school
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
um well
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
well that was like i figured schools
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
i guess schools are like uh different
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
from retail i think churches uh
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
israel churches um are different from
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
schools and this doesn't interfere with
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
the church and the school
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
that may create a certain amount of
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
danger especially since there's uh
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
children often most schools have chil at
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
least some children who have to walk to
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
the location and i just um
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
you certainly can you certainly can put
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
it in with the schools what the
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
what the education you maybe have to say
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
about it or not i don't know but thanks
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
for the question remain clear thank you
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
so churches don't have kids
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh well they do yes but that's uh
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
i mean the people in every any type of
 
00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:57.750 align:start position:0%
i mean the people in every any type of
organization

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
have kids so that's um
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
yes of course they do but that
 
00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:04.710 align:start position:0%
yes of course they do but that
and

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm representative my
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
question is it says that the commission
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
can could enable liquor stores to be
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
open on easter day if they make that
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
decision would all of them need to be
 
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.310 align:start position:0%
decision would all of them need to be
open

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
um you well we do have a represent the
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
liquor commission um i mean i think they
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
make it on
 
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
i think they they make it on a i think
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
they make it on a case-by-case basis
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's some that aren't even open on
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
sundays but you know where you know
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
and of course they have uh right now
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
staffing issues like any other retail
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
outlet i've i noticed they're always
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
advertising for for clerks so they also
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
may not have enough staff to cover every
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
store seven days a week
 
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.870 align:start position:0%
store seven days a week
um

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
follow up for the question um do you
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
think that they're going to be problems
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
i understand the bill it says that it's
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
optional for employees to work but right
 
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.269 align:start position:0%
optional for employees to work but right
now

00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
retail stores or across the state are
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
having problems finding employees do you
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
think there'd be pressure on employees
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
to work on a on a religious what is for
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
many people a religious holiday oh i
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
can't answer that i
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge it's uh
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
no worse than in any other retail outlet
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
in fact i mean
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
in fact from what little i know i do
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
have one friend who worked for the
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
liquor commission over years and he
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
seemed he seemed happy with his job but
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
that's like a very vague anecdote so i
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
don't think it's any better or worse
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
than any other retail outlet and most
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
all of those
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
so you you said if i understood the
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
crate you said there was a danger for
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
kids walking by a liquor store
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
is that is that what you said or did i
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
misunderstand you oh my may have said
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
that i i just
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
i just sort of felt there's issues
 
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
putting a school next to a
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
liquor store or even any other type of
 
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.670 align:start position:0%
liquor store or even any other type of
large

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
large outlet so that's uh that's
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
something i just felt like
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
that was just sort of a
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
decision i made i was trying to make the
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
bill like
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
more palatable to the to the committee
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
but um i
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
that maybe
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
i mean you may want to also allow them
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
to locate it near the schools too so
 
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.429 align:start position:0%
to locate it near the schools too so
okay

00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs again
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
quick question um representative um when
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
it when churches are not allowed to to
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry liquor stores are not
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
permitted to build within a certain
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
number of feet within um within a church
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
does that include synagogues and mosques
 
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
um yes i believe the law
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
well it's certainly uh i certainly
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
should say that but i think the law
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
refers to of course i think it's
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
something like
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
places of worship uh which would be any
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
religion and so yeah that's those laws
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
have always been the
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
professional knowledge always interpret

the liquid commission
who's

00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:11.590 align:start position:0%
 
neutral

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman good morning
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
and committee members my name is aiden
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
moore i'm the legal coordinator for the
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
state liquor commission
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
and we're here just to offer you some
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
additional information as you consider
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
commission not opening the stores on
 
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.470 align:start position:0%
commission not opening the stores on
easter

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
easter
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
is really not really a religious
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
consideration on behalf of the
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
commission it's really a business
 
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.870 align:start position:0%
commission it's really a business
decision

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
that the commission allows
 
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.390 align:start position:0%
that the commission allows
people

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
to be with their families on what is
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
often considered by many a traditional
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
family day
 
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.669 align:start position:0%
family day
and

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
so that is a significant part of the
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
decision making of course it's written
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
into the law that easter is a day that
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
the store shall be closed
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's important for you to know
 
00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.630 align:start position:0%
i think it's important for you to know
that

00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
sunday is a voluntary work day
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
for commission employees
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
under the collective bargaining
 
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.750 align:start position:0%
under the collective bargaining
agreement

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
that exists with the state
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
and if this law were to pass
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
i believe and i cannot anticipate
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
exactly what the issues might be but i
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
think there would most likely be
 
00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:20.390 align:start position:0%
think there would most likely be
some

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
grievances filed
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
under the collective bargaining
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
agreement uh by state employees so
 
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.950 align:start position:0%
agreement uh by state employees so
that's

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
a very strong possibility
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
so we um
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
and it's important i believe for you
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
also know i believe it's listed in our
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
methodology is that none of the
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
commission's stores are located
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
currently within 200 feet of
 
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.750 align:start position:0%
currently within 200 feet of
any

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
religious facility or school
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to take any questions
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at i assume this is the
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
removed easter i guess
 
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.430 align:start position:0%
removed easter i guess
um

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require you to have to be
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
open on easter if we remove it from the
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
statute right
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
so you could
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
help those state employees or
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
where they if the state employees don't
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
want to come to work you just say okay
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
well we're not going to open up for
 
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.830 align:start position:0%
well we're not going to open up for
easter

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
easter
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
well i um that's correct mr chairman i
 
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
well i um that's correct mr chairman i
think

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
feels that the current law as written is
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
something that we work with very
 
00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:43.110 align:start position:0%
something that we work with very
successfully

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
and don't necessarily
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
see a strong rationale to change it
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
which does not mean we oppose the bill
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
well i would say that uh
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
it seems a little awkward that we just
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
pick easter and not maybe passover or
 
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.149 align:start position:0%
pick easter and not maybe passover or
other

00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
religious holidays and i would certainly
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
defer to the wisdom of this committee
 
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.830 align:start position:0%
defer to the wisdom of this committee
sir

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
on your question and and would you also
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
agree that that pretty much all the
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
locations you know that we're not really
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
looking for a big expansion
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
going forward that uh let's maybe i
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
guess maybe some marijuana stores but
 
00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:19.990 align:start position:0%
guess maybe some marijuana stores but
uh

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
that that we don't plan to have a big
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
expansion so
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
this most of the statute is really not
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
not a big issue because there's not too
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
often removing liquor stores to at this
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
point or opening new ones
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
well in some cases um
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
there may be some contraction in the
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
number of stores based upon a number of
 
00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.310 align:start position:0%
number of stores based upon a number of
factors

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
factors
 
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.029 align:start position:0%
factors
so

00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
i i would say i don't think the
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
commission has seen an expansion for a
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
fair enough representative
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
um mr moore
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
might this
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
change uh cause other
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
folks of other
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i um say if we have a a
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
person who celebrates ramadan
 
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:19.990 align:start position:0%
person who celebrates ramadan
or

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.110 align:start position:0%
or
uh

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
different different holy days and we're
 
00:22:23.919 --> 00:22:25.029 align:start position:0%
different different holy days and we're
just

00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
selecting easter as a christian holiday
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
might this cause problems if they're
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
if they are scheduled to work on one of
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
their special days
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
i i think what makes uh this
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative i'm not sure i could
 
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.470 align:start position:0%
uh representative i'm not sure i could
probably

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
reasonably answer your question i'm not
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
sure with the
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
other religious holidays celebrated by
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
in in the construction of this statute
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature appears not to have
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned them
 
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.830 align:start position:0%
mentioned them

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
i think what makes this uh somewhat
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
distinctive is that it intersects with
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
the easter is
 
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.990 align:start position:0%
the easter is
usually

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
usually
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
always on a sunday
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
and the sunday is a voluntary day for
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
commission employees so as was mentioned
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
by um i forget who in the committee uh a
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
number of those commission's stores are
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
not open on sundays simply because
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
there's no demand for that and employees
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
are not required to work
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
it is a commission's business decision
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
to open keep open stores
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
that have a high profitability
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
on sundays and it is a
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
an area where an employee is offered the
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work and many choose to
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
work on sundays
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
um but east where easter is specifically
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
listed in the statute
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
the stores are closed on easter
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:06.710 align:start position:0%

the

00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
muslim holiday
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
of uh ramadan is not a single day
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
and so uh whereas easter is a single day
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
and always on a sunday so
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
just like hanukkah is not one single day
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
is by by having them able to
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
distill liquors
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
with locally uh sourced ingredients
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's from their farm or another
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
farm in new hampshire
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
will bring them additional revenues that
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
they dearly need most farms in new
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire small farms make no more
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
profit than ten thousand dollars a year
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
so this would greatly help them
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
to keep their farms this encourages
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
consumers to visit farms driving
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
incremental tourism throughout the state
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
which means gas
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants things like that hotels so
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's a
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's a big boon for us and we
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
see with vineyards in our state we bring
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
people from out of state
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
to come up here so this would be the
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.150 align:start position:0%
same thing
um

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
this creates more demand for crops grown
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
visits to farms for those
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
people who don't have families and go to
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
a farm to see
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know the animals and things like
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
that this brings a different
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
feel to the going to the farm and
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
getting to view what the farmers do and
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
how they operate and
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
they get to taste um
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
get to have a taste of of what they
 
00:42:45.119 --> 00:42:46.069 align:start position:0%
get to have a taste of of what they
produce

00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
produce
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
from distilling
 
00:42:47.839 --> 00:42:49.910 align:start position:0%
from distilling
and

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
the reduced fee for farm-based
 
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.030 align:start position:0%
the reduced fee for farm-based
distilleries

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
distilleries
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
will lower the steep financial barrier
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
put in place by the state that prevents
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
the majority of family farms from
 
00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.630 align:start position:0%
the majority of family farms from
participate

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
in this growing small batch business
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
the 1000
 
00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:12.470 align:start position:0%
the 1000
900

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
900
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
some odd dollars 1 692
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
which is the normal license fee um in
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
talking to the farmers they said it's
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
it's just too costly for them so that
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
that is why we are asking because these
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
are small batches and they're not going
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
part is that
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
i realize this is liquor and that
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's been some objection to it in the
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
past however we do
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
um small batch for wine so this is very
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
similar and wine is also a 500 fee so
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's not making a different class of
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
of cost
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
the farmers will also be able to turn
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
their loss crops into a usable source of
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
income and help keep the family farm a
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
part of the new hampshire landscape
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
which is so important here because if
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
the farms have to sell and houses are
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
built we lose you know the bucolic
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
nature of new hampshire so i hope you
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
all will support this
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions and after we're
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
done i'd like to
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
ask that you call karen gribco who is a
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me this is karen grib co a
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%

00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
forth and she is the sole proprietor of
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.069 align:start position:0%

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative post
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
being someone who's fascinated by
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
numbers and how they're calculated and
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
selected i'm wondering if you can share
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
with me or give me any insights
 
00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.630 align:start position:0%
with me or give me any insights
into

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
how the
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
number 65 65 percent line six in the
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
bill was selected
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
and also on line 17 that sample should
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
not exceed one half ounce
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
could you give me the rationale behind
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
those two numbers how they were
 
00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.430 align:start position:0%
those two numbers how they were
determined

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
determined
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
they were determined by ols
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
they were determined by ols in in a
 
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.870 align:start position:0%
they were determined by ols in in a
conversation

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
we had to
 
00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:27.829 align:start position:0%
we had to
make

00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:45:27.839 --> 00:45:28.790 align:start position:0%
make
um

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
come up with a number
 
00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.349 align:start position:0%
come up with a number
and

00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:31.359 --> 00:45:32.790 align:start position:0%
and
65

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
65
 
00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:33.910 align:start position:0%
65
was

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.190 align:start position:0%
was
because

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
you have to have bottling and paper
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
goods and things like that and in order
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
to really try
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
to make it a farmer's bill using crops
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
we felt that 65 percent was the right
 
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.750 align:start position:0%
we felt that 65 percent was the right
mix

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
another question would you be able to
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
share with me any
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
documentation uh conversation
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
with ols i'm trying to get to the
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
thought process here
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
do you have access to that or is it just
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
all verbal
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
it was verbal there there may be some
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
that is in an email we went back and
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
forth on this several times we were um
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
obviously starting with the 100
 
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.030 align:start position:0%
obviously starting with the 100
fee

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
fee
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
that the person that the farmer wanted
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
to start with and then
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
in the discussion of how to build this
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
spill came out that we should
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
have a certain portion
 
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:37.910 align:start position:0%
have a certain portion
of

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
farmers produce
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
um and and so the numbers were thrown
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
around sure just to be clear i'm i'm i'm
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm incorporating house 65 sorry
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh how 65 and one half ounce were
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
arrived at
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you for any insight you can
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
provide thank you very much thank you so
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
so uh the half ounce is current statute
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
in sampling
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
in other distillery
 
00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.550 align:start position:0%
in other distillery
legislation

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
the idea of tasking the liquor
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
commission on calculating the 65 percent
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
pretty close to impossible uh for them
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
to to do that that's really we don't
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
want them to be doing that so my
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
not just wine we actually do it for beer
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
too we have nanos
 
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.990 align:start position:0%
too we have nanos
okay

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
would you be overly offended if the
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee just simply
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
created a lower license because i agree
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
with you the license is very high
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
and that and we had and but it wouldn't
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily just be for farmers it could
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
be for anybody
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
who wanted to do a small batch
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
and would you be overly offended we
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
amended this bill to do that
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
any other questions i think oh we do
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
represent immaculate uh yes thank you mr
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
chairman three very quick questions
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
number one i assume that any of the
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
alcohol consumed at this market is only
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
a sample
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
you can buy it but you can't drink it
 
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.750 align:start position:0%
you can buy it but you can't drink it
there

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
secondly none of this will go through
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
the liquor store
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
thirdly i can't get any of this at my
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
just i just put that it just correct you
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
can't sell it at all okay correct
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
however there is there is a tax that
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
yeah yes revenue
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
polio yeah um my question is uh
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
there is a uh a distillery in canterbury
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and they do use they source their
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
ingredients from new hampshire
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
is this the same license that we're
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
talking about or is this just basically
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
well this bill that we put forth is was
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
for farmers hoping that we could get
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
this through but
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
the chair just suggested that this be
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
for all folks and i'm in total agreement
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%

i was just going to mention how new
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire has allowed you know micro
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
distilleries to enter into our economies
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
over recent years
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
new micro distilleries like tamworth
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
distilling and mercantile have created
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
jobs in grow new hampshire's economy
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
these micro distilleries produce maximum
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
a maximum amount of liquor each year and
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
sell it on site or through our local new
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%

owners safely fulfill a growing market
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
demand the goal of house bill 1613 would
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
be to allow farmers to do this very same
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
thing just on a much smaller scale
 
00:50:38.079 --> 00:50:39.109 align:start position:0%
thing just on a much smaller scale
farms

00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
farms
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
farms will be allowed to produce up to a
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
thousand cases of liquor per year and
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
may sell it for off-site consumption and
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
it will neighbor it'll enable our
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
farmers across the granite state to tap
 
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
into a growing market and grow our local
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
economies i spoke to one of the previous
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
prime sponsors of this legislation
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative howard perley it's my
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
understanding it sponsored a similar
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
bill a number of years back and he told
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
me one of the concerns was creating too
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
many licensure classifications and that
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
this could end up increasing costs for
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
am i mistaken mr chairman uh we have so
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
many licenses uh i wouldn't think
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
another one really much of a difference
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
but that's that's interesting to hear
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
that we have too many when i spoke to
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
him yesterday he said that was one of
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
the previous concerns that he had heard
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
that they didn't want more that they
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
were like you know having having less
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
classifications and less layers of these
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
licensures would be um you know but i
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
farmers do cover some of the cost of
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
creating this well you know what was
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
theoretically the original house bill
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
1613 which i'm speaking to my
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
understanding the committee is going to
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
make a very favorable changes to it
 
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
which you know i'm more than happy to
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
see but um they'd cover some of the
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
costs and the state would obviously have
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
to cover some of the rest you know any
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
excess costs but i would view it more as
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
an investment into this growing and
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
booming sector of our economy right
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's a number of um farms
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
that would be able to enter into this
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know these micro distillery kind of
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh market and to really be competitive
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
and to really
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
help a lot of uh you know employ a lot
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
of local people so in my opinion i think
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
the state should promote this kind of
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
economic innovation you know using our
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
free market right we're just enabling
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
people to enter into this we're enabling
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
people to be innovative like a lot of
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
these micro distilleries have and this
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
has kind of become more it's like the
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
you know we've seen a lot of the micro
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know vineyards a lot of the micro
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
breweries and now these micro
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
distilleries and they're really um
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
there's something that get people out
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
very excited there's something that
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
bring people to you know a lot of
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
tourism areas like wolfeboro and so i'd
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
like to be able to see some of the local
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
farms in my district be able to take
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
advantage of being able to uh produce
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
you know a limited amount of liquor each
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
year and sell it off site with that i'm
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
not going to remain open to any
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
questions because there's other people
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
who know a lot more than me who'll be
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
able to make clarifications so but i
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%

they'd like to make apple brandy and
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
just explore other ways of
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a history of
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
encouraging entrepreneurship supporting
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
small businesses and supporting
 
00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.549 align:start position:0%
small businesses and supporting
agriculture

00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
and it's under the spirit that we ask
 
00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.349 align:start position:0%
and it's under the spirit that we ask
you

00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.030 align:start position:0%
 
we're

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
i know that a lot of the growers are
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
primarily looking to use their own
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
products and their neighbors products
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
and kind of keeping things very local
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
and supporting this and
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know one of the ways you might think
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
like how is this going to attract people
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
and the monadnock region we have a
 
00:54:40.559 --> 00:54:41.589 align:start position:0%
and the monadnock region we have a
really

00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:54:41.599 --> 00:54:43.030 align:start position:0%
really
strong

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
strong
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
support for local businesses and there's
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
airbnbs and small bed and breakfasts and
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
other types of small hotels and their
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
guests from out of state
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
they want to experience the new
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire way of life and they always
 
00:54:58.559 --> 00:54:59.349 align:start position:0%
hampshire way of life and they always
say

00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
where can we go
 
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:01.990 align:start position:0%
where can we go
to

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.190 align:start position:0%
to
see

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
how life is in new hampshire and so
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
they're always
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
giving them recommendations to go to
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
small farms and other small businesses
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
they're not interested in going to the
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
big commercial places they want to go
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
and talk
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
to the person making the stuff or
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
growing the stuff to find out
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
how we live
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
that was really it's really kind of
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
funny to me having a business that
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
people come and want to know
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
how i live and what i do and then they
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
have dreams of living my life like you
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
know martha stewart or
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
something you know because i have
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
chickens with colored eggs and they go
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
this is so cool and and i know that
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
several of the people that have stayed
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
locally that have visited us have bought
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
homes in our area and
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
it i think it's just good to diversify
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
what people can do and sell on the
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
stands and
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
for the most part um
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
i know that we've all we're not buying
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
things from outside of the state to sell
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
at our small farm stands we're we're
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
buying things from our neighbors and
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
promoting local things and this would
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
just give us another thing to use our
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
product line and
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
and another tourist
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
information place to come
 
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.430 align:start position:0%
information place to come
and

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's basically all we want to do is
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
try to use local things in different
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
ways and
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
and have fun with creating something new
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
and different and
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh see oh that's representative
 
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.150 align:start position:0%
uh see oh that's representative

thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm not sure you can
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
answer as i was hoping representative

00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
duchess
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
might have answered it but um we don't
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
know how many um farmers or other people
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
are going to take advantage of this so
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
my question is about the cost to the
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
state to monitor the safety
 
00:57:01.839 --> 00:57:02.710 align:start position:0%
state to monitor the safety
of

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
these products
 
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:05.670 align:start position:0%
these products
i

00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
i don't know i know that there's a lot
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
of local interest but the costs are
 
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
really prohibitive and i just think
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
something like this would make it easier
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
for them
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
to um to try things and i just don't
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
know how much it would cost to
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
administer i don't think
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'm thinking it wouldn't be
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
that much different than somebody with
 
00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:26.390 align:start position:0%
that much different than somebody with
um

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
with making making wine having a small
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
winery and i know that a lot of them
 
00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.950 align:start position:0%
winery and i know that a lot of them
attract

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
attract
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
big crowds and i don't know how you can
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
monitor that i'm not sure if a micro
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
distillery is going to attract that many
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
people all at once
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
follow up i was really referring more to
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
the safety of the product
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know to um
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
safety standards for for alcohol i'm
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
thinking moonshine and
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
back in those days
 
00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:56.789 align:start position:0%
back in those days
um

00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
i don't really know i just know that
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
everybody that has
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
that manufactures anything on their farm
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
has to follow state rules and
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
regulations and health things and i
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
don't think that you know they're going
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
to take any shortcuts in making this
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
they're going to be really careful with
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
sterilizing bottles because they've
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
already they're already doing it and you
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
know we we all have to have the safe
 
00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:24.230 align:start position:0%
know we we all have to have the safe
handling

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
handling
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
classes and certifications and state
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
licenses and
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
and we all know what we need to do thank
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
hi good morning my name is charlie post
 
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
i live in leinbrough new hampshire as
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
close to the mic as you can
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
willing to get so that'd be great there
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
we go
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
my name is charlie post i live in limbo
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i am a recently retired
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
executive from
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
a food national food production company
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
got a deep understanding of
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
production something that people really
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
didn't talk about before but supply
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
chain and retail distribution um
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
i think the key to this i'm here to
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
support bill 1613. um the the i think
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
the key to this
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity for farmers is that they
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
can't sell to
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
very easily there's a very high barrier
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
of entry to sell products to
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
grocery stores to the state liquor
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
stores and other retailers it's it's uh
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's a challenge because of the cost but
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
they can attract people to their farms
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
and operations and sell products
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
so one of the ways of doing this is to
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
add value so they're not just selling
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
corn or milk it's a value added product
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
that can be more profitable
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that profit makes farms more viable
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
i think we all remember that when the
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic first started
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know you could stand in line forever
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
at market basket and wait to get in or
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
you could go to your local farm and get
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
milk eggs and some of the supplies you
 
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
needed we need to keep that strength of
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
the family farm and the local farm in
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
place and this is a way to do it to do
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
it generated to generate a new revenue
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
stream for them
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
you know you've heard about uh how it
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
would help the overall economy in terms
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
uh tourism and people attending uh
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
attending farms and seeing farms and
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
coming to new hampshire and traveling
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
within new hampshire
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
to see how farms operate i think it's a
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
good opportunity
 
01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
i really like the idea of lowering the
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
barrier of entry in terms of the cost of
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
the of the fee that can be prohibitive
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
to a very small
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
farm that uh you know only
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
yields uh
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
profit margins of ten thousand dollars a
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
sixteen hundred dollar margin is is
 
01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:00.870 align:start position:0%
sixteen hundred dollar margin is is
significant

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
i think i think it's important that
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know we separate this from uh
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
from other farm operations it's much
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
like much like wine distribution or wine
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
production small batch wine production
 
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
there at the
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
at the farm and
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
i realized there's a lot of regulation
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
around that and safety but those those
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
matters are usually handled now
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
i i think it's also important to
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
recognize that they would be using local
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
ingredients uh you know how you
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
calculate the percentage you know i i
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
think it's important that that you you
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
do use locally uh sourced or locally
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
produced items um on the farm but i i
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
really support this bill
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
and i think it would be a great
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to strengthen you know one
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's great resources the
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.990 align:start position:0%
 
great

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh chair
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%

thank you to the chairman and thank you
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
to the board for hearing us on
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
this bill i am a landowner and a
 
01:02:07.839 --> 01:02:08.950 align:start position:0%
this bill i am a landowner and a
consumer

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.829 align:start position:0%
consumer
and

01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
my name is moritz schmidt schweiber get
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
that for the record
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
um so i am very much an advocate for the
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
state um
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
grew up here part of my youth and came
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
back recently and i'm so glad that i did
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
when i witnessed what's happened in all
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
the other states so um i just find that
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire should really be very
 
01:02:28.559 --> 01:02:29.750 align:start position:0%
new hampshire should really be very
open-minded

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
open-minded
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
and get into the game
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
and make it up even playing field so
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
you know consumers can come up here
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
and have a lot of options um
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
and to get access to uh
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
distillery products on a small
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
farm basis is something that uh it's an
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
experience that i think people really
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
will um take advantage of and it will be
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
great for the state
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
so i know we're limited on time so um i
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have anything else really to say
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
on it
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you
 
01:03:04.319 --> 01:03:05.109 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you
uh

01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
chair we'll call on drew klein from
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and committee i'm
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
drew klein from the josiah bartlett
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
center for public policy we're the free
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
market think tank in new hampshire and
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're here to support this bill um we
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
think giving opportunities for small
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
businesses is fantastic it's the way
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
legislature should go but i would echo
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
the chairman's comments from earlier
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
that probably a better way to do this
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
would be them in the bill to just have a
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
general lower tier license that's not
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
segregated for farms that would create
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
more opportunity in new hampshire not
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
less if you were to have something like
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
this though i would make a couple of
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
suggestions as has been noted the 65
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
figure is just unpoliceable
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
um there's no way to do that and there's
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
no public health or safety reason it
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt new hampshire economically
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
or in any other way to have it be you
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
know 60 or 12 percent it doesn't matter
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
you don't want to hamstring the
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
businesses because um
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's a local farm or a local
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
small business
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
they are going to source locally
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
that's just the way these businesses
 
01:04:13.359 --> 01:04:14.309 align:start position:0%
that's just the way these businesses
work

01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
but contingencies happen so a hail storm
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
can take out we had this just last year
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
a hail storm wiped out a lot of apples
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
so you might have to buy apples from
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
across the border so you just don't want
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
to have that percentage in there that
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
would be a problem um
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
and uh otherwise um
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing is a concern
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
is um limiting
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
um this sales to no more than 12 cases
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
to any one customer in a calendar year
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's just kind of a record-keeping
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
thing that would be i think you know a
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
challenge for small businesses and um
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know if you have a
 
01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:50.470 align:start position:0%
you know if you have a
uh

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
i know when i help out local businesses
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
whether it's a local bakery
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
we try to buy stuff and give to friends
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
as gifts and this sort of would get in
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
the way of that so i don't know that you
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
want to police that and regulate that
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
and force that record keeping on them
 
01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative abel has a question
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yes thank you thank you for your uh
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
testimony um
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
would you be able to suggest either now
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
or subsequently some some way that we
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
could amend the 66
 
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:24.950 align:start position:0%
could amend the 66
yeah

01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
so that it would be clear
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
if we what what we were doing but we
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
didn't have to be that precise sure i
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
could come back with i mean
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
again generally i
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
i think any percentage is going to be
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
impossible to police i i just think
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
that's the bottom line
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
um but and to rub rose to your question
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
about moonshine as somebody who grew up
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
in western north carolina the
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
capital of moonshining
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
if you want to depress moonshining you
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
pass bills like this that make it legal
 
01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
for farmers to sell stuff i mean
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
moonshine was moonshine because it was
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
illegal and heavily taxed and it was
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
black market so this is what brings it
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
out of the black market and makes it
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
you you drew a question
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
representative i'm trying to anyway so
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
you guys can do it i would like to
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
interject before you speak
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission is that's not
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
really what they're doing they're not
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
if you're worried about moonshine
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's the atf right okay right now
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
everybody here before we even start
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
about a new hampshire license you have
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
to first get your federal license with
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
the atf and they're the ones who are
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
going to worry about that right i'll
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
withdraw a question i was not trying to
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.829 --> 01:06:44.839 align:start position:0%
thanks for the
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you all right thank
 
01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:49.829 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you all right thank
you

01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh and last but not least aidan moore
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
liquor commission uh is opposed to the
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill as written
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
which i assume that means it can be
 
01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.470 align:start position:0%
which i assume that means it can be
fixed

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
again for the committee's reference my
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
name is aiden moore i'm the legal
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the state liquor
 
01:07:14.079 --> 01:07:15.109 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the state liquor
commission

01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we are opposed to this as written
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
and i think to ask answer some of the
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
questions about 65 how that figure came
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
up i think the original draft of the
 
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
bill that we saw when we first prepared
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
our fiscal worksheet
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
had 100
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
of the products
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
which we thought was
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
completely unenforceable
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
and it is now at 65 which we still think
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
is unenforceable
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
there's just no way for us to to measure
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
it there's no way for us to police it
 
01:07:47.359 --> 01:07:48.549 align:start position:0%
it there's no way for us to police it
um

01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:48.559 --> 01:07:49.510 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.230 align:start position:0%
so
we

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
as as you know for those of you who have
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
been on this committee for any length of
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
time the state liquor commission is
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
extremely supportive
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire manufacturers
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
extends great consideration
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
to our wine manufacturers
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
our liquor manufacturers to try to get
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
their products into the state liquor
 
01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:13.029 align:start position:0%
their products into the state liquor
stores

01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
stores
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
and support them
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
um because they realize what an
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
important source
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
these products are to the consumer in
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
so the commission is completely
 
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
supportive of trying to help a new
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire manufacturer
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
we don't believe
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
that creating a new license specifically
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
for a farmer
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
is probably the
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
best approach i i think our suggestion
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
and possibly mr chairman we could work
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
this out in a subcommittee at some point
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
is to look at an approach that creates a
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
tier of sorts
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
for the committee's benefit the beverage
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
world beer the beer world has a
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.030 align:start position:0%
 
great

01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
we got a lot of coffee going to be be
 
01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:07.990 align:start position:0%
we got a lot of coffee going to be be
purchased

01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
purchased
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
this week
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
so beverages have a have a tiered
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
approach as as you mentioned mr chairman
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
a business that is interested in
 
01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
becoming a an entry level beverage
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturer can obtain a nano brewer's
 
01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:20.550 align:start position:0%
manufacturer can obtain a nano brewer's
license

01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
and hopefully their success
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
causes them to move into a
 
01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.870 align:start position:0%
causes them to move into a
larger

01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
larger
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer license
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
same with wine manufacturing an entry
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
level wine manufacturer
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
pays a fee of 100
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
but it's often tied to their production
 
01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:42.550 align:start position:0%
but it's often tied to their production
levels

01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
levels
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
the fee is lower as they're an incubator
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
once they've kind of crossed out of that
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
incubation period
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
we would look at their production and
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
say now it's time for you to move on to
 
01:09:53.199 --> 01:09:54.470 align:start position:0%
say now it's time for you to move on to
a

01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
different license type
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
so we would think that that
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
approach would be
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
realistic to possibly bring here to the
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
liquor manufacturer
 
01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.630 align:start position:0%
liquor manufacturer
especially

01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
especially
 
01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.550 align:start position:0%
especially
um

01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
for the farmers
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
if that's where they would like to go
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
but we would not distinguish them as a
 
01:10:14.239 --> 01:10:15.350 align:start position:0%
but we would not distinguish them as a
farm

01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
farm
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
that we would look at them as a
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturer period and
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
some of the considerations that
 
01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.750 align:start position:0%
some of the considerations that
may

01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
deal with where the product would be
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
sold so for example a liquor
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer in new hampshire can sell
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
products to people who come to visit
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
them they if they sample it
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
and like it they can sell it to them
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
right there
 
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.470 align:start position:0%
right there
so

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.510 align:start position:0%
so
the

01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
i forget who mentioned the point but yes
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
the entry level requirement would be to
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
get your federal license first
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh but then also we would have some
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
questions about what
 
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
how this would be sold
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
products sold
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
at a farm stand
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
where you're rolling up and you're
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
buying your corn and your tomatoes and
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
two bottles of whiskey
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
we would want to see a
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
facility that is a commercial facility
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
where the public can visit where the
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
commission has the ability to visit and
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
audit and create perform the services
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
that are required to make sure the
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
license farmer's market would be okay
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
barmy the farmer's market
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
farmers might well liquor manufacturers
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
can can now sell it a farmer's market as
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
well so that would be
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
extended most of the provisions that you
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
see in this bill
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
records and things of that nature are
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
exactly what exists now in the liquor
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturer license they've just been
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
added to this bill
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:55.590 align:start position:0%
to um
to

01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
ensure compliance and and the fact that
 
01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:58.470 align:start position:0%
ensure compliance and and the fact that
they

01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
are following the same standard
 
01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.510 align:start position:0%
are following the same standard
so

01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
we believe that this uh
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill as written is
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
not the best approach and we certainly
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
would look forward to working with the
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor and the committee to try to find
 
01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:12.550 align:start position:0%
sponsor and the committee to try to find
a

01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
better approach that
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.350 align:start position:0%
 
great

01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'm not sure that
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
that you can answer this mr moore but um
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know how much a federal
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
license would cost that they would have
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
to apply for and obtain first
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative i i do not know that as i
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
could get that information for you if
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
you'd like
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
i think that'd be really helpful for the
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
having no more cards on house bill 16 13
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
is anybody willing to testify see none
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
so kate fry uh from new futures was in
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%

okay

01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know what i didn't even forgot to
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.159 --> 01:14:48.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:48.080 --> 01:15:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:50.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.480 --> 01:16:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
today

01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
i said i'm gonna flip the script here
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
and ask you questions ask ask questions
 
01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:28.470 align:start position:0%
and ask you questions ask ask questions
right

01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
i guess people ask me that all questions
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
all the time that's true
 
01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.590 align:start position:0%
all the time that's true
okay

01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
all right we'll open up the public
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%

01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
which um clarifies let's say a um a
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
point of dispute over the necessity for
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
two points of sales systems
 
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh for those operating um
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh brewpub lice licenses where they sell
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
they sell um
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
food and drink
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
at a distillery or a brewery
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
i was approached by the brewers
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
who said that
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
the they were
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
that this rule was being enforced upon
 
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.390 align:start position:0%
that this rule was being enforced upon
them

01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
by the liquor commission that they had
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
to have two point of sales systems um
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
separation from for tax purposes from
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
when they sold to take home and when
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
they sold for on-premise consumption
 
01:17:47.199 --> 01:17:48.550 align:start position:0%
they sold for on-premise consumption
um

01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
as many as you know that that's not
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
necessary these points of sales systems
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
are very sophisticated the reason why it
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
was being enforced was because there's
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
two different tax rates
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's very easy to program the
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate tax rate for what you're
 
01:18:00.239 --> 01:18:01.350 align:start position:0%
appropriate tax rate for what you're
selling

01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
selling
 
01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.310 align:start position:0%
selling
so

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
contacted me and said well this is not
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
being enforced
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
so i circled back up with the the
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
brewers i said you guys just make me put
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
something forward that's not a thing and
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
they were able to cite multiple
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
instances including yesterday
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
they contacted me um that this is being
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
enforced it's not clear from liquor
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
commission what is
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
and what it should be so my goal here is
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
to codify in state statute um that you
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
can use one point of sale system you
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
still have to collect the appropriate
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
taxes there's just no need for multiple
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
transactions the state's going to get
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
its money anyways let's speed things up
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
lower costs and
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
and reduce some bureaucracy i also
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
submitted to
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
the committee an amendment was another
 
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that was i was asked to bring
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
forward i'd ask that the committee kind
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
of consider this in a separate manner um
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not i i obviously support the
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
amendment i'm sponsoring it but um
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's considered as a separate as a
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
separate piece and it would extend that
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
to food stores who opera
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
also operate
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
a preparation site
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
with a point of sale
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
system so you have some of these i
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
believe there's somebody here to testify
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
to that effect but you have um you have
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
these these stores where they'll have a
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
food preparation or for a food kitchen
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
on one side like a convenience store on
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
and once again there's no point to
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
having two different transactions if
 
01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
but that's the that's the purpose of the
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
bill it doesn't have a fiscal note
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
because there's no cost to the state it
 
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
won't change any of the revenue that
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
we're collecting it'll just make life a
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
little easier if you want to go and
 
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
have a pint and maybe purchase a
 
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:49.110 align:start position:0%
have a pint and maybe purchase a
six-pack

01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
no questions
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh aidan i don't see a card here from
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
you i'm sorry
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
oh you do have a question
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
do you have a copy of the amendment
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
i do not have a copy of the amendment um
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
i emailed the amendment to the committee
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
maybe yesterday
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
i can reafford it
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
its amendment
 
01:20:12.239 --> 01:20:13.750 align:start position:0%
its amendment
2022

01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.470 align:start position:0%
2022
0282h

01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
0282h
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
it adds i can read it since i don't have
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
copies of it it looks like uh
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative johnson is going to take
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
care of that for me
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
but basically it adds um it adds another
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
section says any licensee who operates a
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
food store with one preparation area on
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
site may use the same point of sale
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
register as as the licensee stores for
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
all transactions
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
so it's the same thing just expanding it
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
out a little more and once again i ask
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
that the committee
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
consider the amendment um and not not
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
say tangentially related same concept
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
but in a different area other than a
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
brew pub
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
we do have another question
 
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative weston
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr berry for coming in and
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
representative barry for bringing us
 
01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:57.910 align:start position:0%
representative barry for bringing us
this

01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
i just am curious about why when i go to
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
the grocery store
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i order a lobster
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
live it's um i don't have to pay tax but
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
if i have it steamed then i do
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
but i go through the same checkout
 
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.350 align:start position:0%
but i go through the same checkout
procedure

01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
so how does that relate to what you're
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
doing here with the preparation site
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
versus not so you're actually making the
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
the argument um right if you steam the
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
lobster it's a prepared food then you
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
have your meals and room tagged meals
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
and meals meals and room stacks tacked
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
on at nine percent um
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
and the the point of sale system at your
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
local market basket is sophisticated
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
enough to know the difference and
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
collect different tax rate um so this is
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
just clarifying that these facilities
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
these brewery these breweries that have
 
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
the exact same capacity as you just
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
described with your lobster
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
can use one point of sale system just
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
like you do at market basket for your
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
steam lobster i've never thought about
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
that but that's a great way of looking
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative johnson do you have a
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
question so i got the amendment coming
 
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
for a copy for all of us she's printing
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
it out now great thank you
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
um see
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
no more questions for him that was easy
 
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
all right trip to concord get
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
so aidan i don't have a card here from
 
01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.870 align:start position:0%
so aidan i don't have a card here from
commissions

01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
the commission has no position on the
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
bill sir
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
i'm happy
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
random enforcement
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
in-house rule uh that it probably never
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
went to more rule making that that
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
this division that uh
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
when the auditor shows up he expects
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh i would i would probably suggest sir
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
looking for the records is what their
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
audit would be looking to accomplish how
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
much product was sold clearly a beverage
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
manufacturer has the
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
need to report to the commission how
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
much it sells for the purposes of
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
calculating taxation beer tax correct
 
01:23:18.239 --> 01:23:19.590 align:start position:0%
calculating taxation beer tax correct
and

01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
i think the commission
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
supports um
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
the notion that today's point of sale
 
01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.110 align:start position:0%
the notion that today's point of sale
systems

01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
are sophisticated enough to be able to
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
break down sales
 
01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.350 align:start position:0%
break down sales
and

01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
to provide information
 
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
to the commission
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
so can you put out a bulletin or
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
something do we really have to do this
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
by legislation can you put on a bulletin
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
and just
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
i'll be happy to speak to the chief of
 
01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the commissioner
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
good i look forward to hearing from
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
from the chairman on this issue because
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
it just seems insane that it's
 
01:24:16.629 --> 01:24:16.639 align:start position:0%
randomly enforced and
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
and which tells me it's like one auditor
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
makes a stink about it and another one
 
01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.629 align:start position:0%
makes a stink about it and another one
doesn't

01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
um i i think i would
 
01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:25.910 align:start position:0%
um i i think i would
um

01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
disagree with that characterization i
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
think there's an intent to apply
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
a standard uniformly across the state
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.189 align:start position:0%
there's no
advantage

01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
to anyone certainly not to the citizens
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
policy made on the whim of one person
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the chief of enforcement oversees
 
01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:51.110 align:start position:0%
and the chief of enforcement oversees
the

01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory and audit function
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
and has worked very hard to ensure that
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's consistency in the application
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
of the law
 
01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.470 align:start position:0%
of the law
so

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
i i think if if you would like and if
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that is going to go to a
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of course we would be
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
able to appear at that and provide you
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
with information to answer your
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
questions that
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
may not
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
i may not be able to provide to you
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
today i'm i'm shocked you weren't
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
prepared to explain why this
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
he was here yesterday
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh you weren't prepared to
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh come in and tell us why
 
01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
oh i think the sponsor did that no no no
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and i would i would probably say um
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
would repeat my desire
 
01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
information that the commission desires
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
to have a uniform approach across the
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
state fair and consistent
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
and that that's what we enabled to do
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
enable uh that's what we endeavor to do
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh on a day-to-day mission and i'll be
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
happy to have the appropriate staff here
 
01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:02.629 align:start position:0%
happy to have the appropriate staff here
to

01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
and especially if there's a
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
possible mischaracterization of
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
something to try to clear that up
 
01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.270 align:start position:0%
something to try to clear that up
oh

01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.870 align:start position:0%
oh
okay

01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
because why because i have to say i did
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
make a couple of random
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
calls to different uh
 
01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.870 align:start position:0%
calls to different uh
manufacturers

01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
and most of them were shocked and never
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
even heard of this policy
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
that is not that it doesn't exist it
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
that they had to use separate point of
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
i believe i believe that
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
this may very well have to do with
 
01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.950 align:start position:0%
this may very well have to do with
um

01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
whether a better beverage manufacturer
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
has an additional license
 
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
a beverage manufacturer has a license on
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
its own to sell its products
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers also have under
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
the statute the ability to apply for a
 
01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:02.709 align:start position:0%
the statute the ability to apply for a
second

01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
on-premise license
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
so depending upon how that business
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
is put together
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
how it's organized what the facility
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.790 align:start position:0%
looks like
um

01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
may very well play an important so
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
you're saying this is this so if i it
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
was true i did talk to someone who had a
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
single license and never heard of it so
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
this would never come up this only comes
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
up when
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
okay but we'll make sure we have the
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate staff here to answer all
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
your questions sir thank you you're
 
01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.629 align:start position:0%

thank you very much
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
i have two more cards uh joe greene from
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
are you here for the amendment then i
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%

thank you chairman hunt and members of
 
01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:05.360 align:start position:0%

the amendment
i

01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:09.270 align:start position:0%
i
run

01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
run
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
a convenience store and food service
 
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.270 align:start position:0%
a convenience store and food service
entity

01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
entity
 
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
we actually have a few of them in the
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:17.830 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
and

01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
this has presented customer service
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
issues in the past
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
having the
 
01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.470 align:start position:0%
having the
conversation

01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
with our enforcement
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
scott dunn
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
going through the process of trying to
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
ring up
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
a six pack of beer per se
 
01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
at a food service pizza or deli
 
01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.430 align:start position:0%
at a food service pizza or deli
those

01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
transactions cannot be done in the two
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
separate entities so
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
this is what i was told
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
i wanted to have
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
them run up in one register and i was
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
told i couldn't i would only have be
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
able to ring it up in the convenience
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
store part of the
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
of the store
 
01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:57.830 align:start position:0%
of the store
although

01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
although
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
my company owns
 
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:00.870 align:start position:0%
my company owns
both

01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
the the deli pizza and the sea store so
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
i think there's some confusion i guess
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
even from the last speaker of
 
01:29:10.229 --> 01:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
if this is enforced or not again when we
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
try to go out and and have this happen
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
we were told that it it's not possible
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
at this time so that's why i am in
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
support of this amendment because it'll
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
clarify it it'll make it very simple and
 
01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
i think it would be um to everybody
 
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's confused they'll identify it
 
01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.030 align:start position:0%
that's confused they'll identify it
properly

01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
properly
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
so you have more than one license you
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
have an on and off premise i have off
 
01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:32.950 align:start position:0%
have an on and off premise i have off
premise

01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
premise
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's just an off-premise license so it's
 
01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
either way it's still a take away with
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
the food then right
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
but then
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's an off-premise
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
license but one part of the store is
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
like a classic convenience store right
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
and the other one would be is say take
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
out deli that has no tables in it that's
 
01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:57.030 align:start position:0%
out deli that has no tables in it that's
correct

01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's it seems simple right but then when
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
we went to do it like nope you can't do
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
it this way well i know myself i once
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
one time i was i went into a
 
01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:07.669 align:start position:0%
one time i was i went into a
a

01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
convenience store that also had they did
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
have two tables
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
and and i tried to open a beer
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
and he said no no you can't do that
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
right you have to leave very carefully
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
take everything and leave
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
so and this was many many years ago
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
before i i actually knew the difference
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
between an on-premise and off-premise
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
license yeah think of it if you wanted
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
to get a sandwich okay and you you said
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know what i want to buy a pack of
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
beer too you literally have to go to the
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
different registers instead of one point
 
01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
of sale i mean that that's that's just
 
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
been the way it's been for a long time
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
so this this like i said not to repeat
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
myself this will really keep it clean
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
keep it black and white and nobody can
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
question whether it's a gray area
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
because right now it sounds like it's a
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
big gray area
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
right well
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
if i had a
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
i know an on-premise licensee
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
pizza joint
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
that sells the beer
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
the question is is that obviously he
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:12.719 --> 01:31:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:14.790 align:start position:0%
right
so

01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
okay we do have questions
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
just so i can make sure i understand it
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
your pos systems
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
either one of them could do
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
all the transactions
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
and but you have but you're told that
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
you have to have two
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
so you could set one of your pos systems
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
up so it could ring up
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
the different tax rates for the
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
different items like your sandwich that
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
you bought at the deli and then your
 
01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.149 align:start position:0%
you bought at the deli and then your
beer

01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
beer
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
you could bring that up into the
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
different right categories with the
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
right taxes
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
and there would be no problem in one
 
01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.669 align:start position:0%
and there would be no problem in one
system

01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
i could but i was told that i i'm not
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to right but i'm just saying one
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
of your systems could do this and you
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need the two right okay and
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's what i wanted to clarify making
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
sure thank you thank you
 
01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
yeah my question is um okay so you own a
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
convenience store and you also own a
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
restaurant because your deli is
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
licensed as a restaurant so that's why
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
you need the two licenses because you
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
have two different businesses
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
it's actually a licensed combined
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
license as a convenience store with a
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
food service one food service operation
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
so it's a combined license okay okay all
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
right the key element is he doesn't have
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
tables right
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
so he is an off-premise licensee right
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
but i'm but i mean we'll have this
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
discussion later on
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
regarding a food truck a food truck as a
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant so
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
technically i think he is a restaurant
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
yeah but we don't uh the liquor
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
community we have a food requirement but
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have any restaurant
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
requirements just saying it's two
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
different licenses
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
so he yeah has yet another license for a
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
food service
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
if he's in a uh
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
one of those infamous nine cities
 
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
this year may comment on that
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
i think that the uh i think that
 
01:33:04.629 --> 01:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes what happens is that
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
and into your example i think some even
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
the public gets a little bit uh confused
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
by it but we can't be confused right so
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
if we have a uh deli uh and there's no
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
seating and it's not a service it's not
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
a on-premise license there's no question
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
what happens you have to take that beer
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
in a bag and leave the store you can't
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
consume it there
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
so i think and again depending on what
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
your definition is a restaurant could be
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
something that you would sit down to
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
your point and you know have a nice
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
glass of wine or have a nice beer and so
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
again there's a gray area in that i try
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
to be very careful not to call it a
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant and i don't mean to be
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
disrespectful but i try very careful not
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
to call it that because again a lot of
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
public people in the public will say
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
well then i can sit down and why can't i
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
crack open the vrtr point and so i say
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
hey look this is a deli uh it's a
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
takeout deli it's take out pizza store
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
it's a convenience store with
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
off-premise license
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
right hope that clarifies hey well yeah
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
i think we got it thank you thank you
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
very much i have one more
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
card left
 
01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
drew klein
 
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
i'm so glad you came here you know
 
01:34:22.239 --> 01:34:23.030 align:start position:0%
i'm so glad you came here you know
so

01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm so glad i came too i don't
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
need to be uh you know long on this uh
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
where do i whatever the origin of this
 
01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:33.830 align:start position:0%
where do i whatever the origin of this
two

01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
cashier checkout point of sale systems
 
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm not certain that it's in law i
 
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
think it may be as mr moore pointed out
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
an issue of the licenses tears because
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:45.669 align:start position:0%
as you know
each

01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
each
 
01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:46.629 align:start position:0%
each
license

01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
requires separate record keeping and
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
that may be sort of the origin of it but
 
01:34:50.239 --> 01:34:51.270 align:start position:0%
that may be sort of the origin of it but
um

01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
as a as a consumer
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
it's very frustrating you have to wait
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
in line and go to two different things
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
for the business owners i mean in our
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
labor shortage right now in particular
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
you have to staff two different fit
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
places and some uh brew pubs are pretty
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
large and so you can't buy
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a major inconvenience
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
for the consumer to have to
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
finish their meal and check out and
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
there are literally
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
six packs on the wall that you are not
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to buy you have to go to a
 
01:35:23.590 --> 01:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
separate cash register and buy them and
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
in some
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
breweries you have to go to a separate
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
building uh to do that and it's just
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
it's a regulation that
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
technology has um made obsolete so this
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
would be a good clarification for that
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
so i would say that i don't think this
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
brewpub problem
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay because a brewpub license is
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
01:35:47.199 --> 01:35:48.550 align:start position:0%
allowed to
sell

01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
sell
 
01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:49.350 align:start position:0%
sell
another

01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
is before me right now we can blame the
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
room license i mean sure but it is the
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
total trampoline the three-tier system
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
because it allows you to manufacture
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
right stock
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
sell as a restaurant have mixed drinks
 
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
have cocktails outside of your own beer
 
01:36:10.719 --> 01:36:11.830 align:start position:0%
have cocktails outside of your own beer
products

01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
and you can feel growlers and sell six
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
packs right
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
so yes theoretically if they if they
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
would just have that license
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
correct then they would have it but then
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
they have to be a restaurant and
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
brewpub is a as a
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh not the legal term brewpub i should
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
say so you're correct
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
stand corrected there
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
um all right that's all i had all right
 
01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
i have no more cards oh you would like
 
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
to speak yes you'll fill out a card for
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
us yes
 
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
i registered last night oh you know i i
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not getting used to this yet
 
01:36:51.870 --> 01:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
okay this is
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
1556 and somebody
 
01:36:55.679 --> 01:36:57.109 align:start position:0%
1556 and somebody
signed

01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
signed
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
test the first song test
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
usually if the yes is supposed to pop to
 
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
so you see a yes i don't see any yeses
 
01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:17.910 align:start position:0%
so you see a yes i don't see any yeses
okay

01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
so you can fill it out afterwards don't
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
worry about it now
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
we come on come on down all right
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
hi sorry still getting used to the
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
technology also yeah we we this we had
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
this all down to a science before when
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't have in here
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
and and the if you signed in it me and
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
if you say yes to speaking it pops right
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
up to the top
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what happened okay go
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
ahead sorry about that um my name is
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
dennis smallner i own concord craft
 
01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
brewing company which is a nanobrewery
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
right across the street from where you
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
good people park when you come here
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
um and i just had an audit we're nano
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
brewery plus which means we offer food
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
um and we're in under the nano brewery
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
license and i just had an audit on
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
tuesday because we are probably the
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
business closest to meeting the 2000
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
barrel limit
 
01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
underneath our current license and so
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
i've been in discussions with the liquor
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
commission about what we may need to do
 
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
differently when we change
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
and it's true
 
01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:16.870 align:start position:0%
and it's true
that

01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
nano breweries and brew pubs are able to
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
both sell
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
beer to go
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
as well as a draft beer right across the
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
bar they can we can we can give a draft
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
beer and we can give the customer a
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
growler on a single transaction
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
up until i do 2000 barrels a year and
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
then i need to register as a beverage
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and get a second license
 
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:40.870 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and get a second license
because

01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
in order to sell
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
more than one pint i need a second i
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
need a restaurant license as well to
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
have an on-premise
 
01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:50.470 align:start position:0%
have an on-premise
um

01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
license and have the ability to sell the
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
draft beer in addition to just producing
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
for you can have a food truck
 
01:38:58.260 --> 01:38:58.270 align:start position:0%
uh tried that in concord
 
01:38:58.270 --> 01:39:00.390 align:start position:0%
uh tried that in concord
[Laughter]

01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
maybe another city it's a little easier
 
01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.350 align:start position:0%
maybe another city it's a little easier
um

01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
but uh but yeah so um
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
so for us and i had the discussion with
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
my lovely auditor who was very helpful
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
and she did clarify to me on tuesday
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
that i can use the same pos system but i
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
think the difference is we often confuse
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
pos system with cash register i'm not
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to give that customer a growler
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
and a draft beer and take their credit
 
01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
card under one transaction i can give
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
them the draft beer cash them out at the
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
register and then they have to walk
 
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
around to a separate location that is
 
01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
not across the bar and not across a
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
table in order to sell beer to go
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's a growler or a four pack or
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
six this is your singular singular
 
01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:44.149 align:start position:0%
six this is your singular singular
license

01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
for a beverage manufacturer currently
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
with a nanobrewery i can do all of that
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
in a single transaction with a single
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
pos system so she did clarify to me that
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
i can continue to use my pos system
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
because it is sophisticated enough to
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
calculate the difference between a draft
 
01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
beer on premises and to go beer which
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
are taxed at different rates
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
but i still need to have a separate
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
checkout location and a separate
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
transaction for that customer i can't
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
while they're sitting there give them
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
beer to go which i currently do um
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
and in order to so we've been planning
 
01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
for this um this transition and so what
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
we've had to do is get a second register
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
which obviously has a cost um get a
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
separate space where people can check
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
out that's not where they're sitting and
 
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
consuming a beer on premises
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
as well as have the the space in order
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i will have to tell our customers
 
01:40:42.149 --> 01:40:42.159 align:start position:0%
and train our staff um that they can't
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
any longer provide a four pack or a
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
growler across the bar we need to cash
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
them out and then have them walk over it
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll have this fixed before
 
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
you do that
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
um and i guess my only point is that it
 
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
the the nano brewery license has worked
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
very well for us i think we're a great
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
example of we're allowed to start with a
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
small license we invested heavily in the
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
brewing equipment we added food to be
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
able to add and the plus license to be
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
have draft beer instead of just tasters
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
um covet hit and that was a little bit
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
difficult because we didn't have enough
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
capacity to distribute to supermarkets
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
we now do but in order to meet that
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
capacity and to grow our business we
 
01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
have to change our license and now we
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
have to stop doing things the way that
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
have worked very well just because we
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
sell one more barrel or case of beer a
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
year than we did the last couple years
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
so we'll hopefully get this problem
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
quick fixed quickly okay
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
we're like i said we've invested for it
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
and we're prepared for it but it is an
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
obstacle to people like us and the
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
reality is it
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
it's not just the cost of another of
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
sale system is the cost of the license
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
each year to maintain that separate
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
point of sale system correct
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
it would certainly be easier to continue
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
with a single license if the beverage
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturer could accommodate in the
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
same way a nano brewery and a brute
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
maybe we have too many licenses maybe
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's the problem
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to follow the laws
 
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that it's a different
 
01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
challenge for you guys okay all right
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
sitting down thank you for coming and
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
i'll fill it up let us know that we have
 
01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
we are successful in our our our
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
philosophy when we thought the nano was
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
going to be a stepping stone for someone
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
who would then eventually become a
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
full-fledged custom brewer i know it's
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
worked really well for other groups too
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
so yes it has
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%

and access the customer base in that

through a separate and often cumbersome
 
03:23:39.510 --> 03:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
licensing process

03:23:45.269 --> 03:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
procedures vary by municipality
 
03:23:47.269 --> 03:23:47.279 align:start position:0%

hampshire's food truck business
 
03:23:51.269 --> 03:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
landscape is overly burdensome and
 
03:23:53.590 --> 03:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily confusing
 
03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
this is especially frustrating for food
 
03:23:58.070 --> 03:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
truck owners many of whom were attracted
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
to the business model because it allowed
 
03:24:02.710 --> 03:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
them to be nimble in terms of their menu
 
03:24:04.389 --> 03:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
offerings their hours
 
03:24:04.399 --> 03:24:05.510 align:start position:0%

and

03:24:05.510 --> 03:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:24:08.070 --> 03:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps most importantly at least
 
03:24:10.830 --> 03:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
relevant to this bill
 
03:24:13.750 --> 03:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
geography that said health and safety
 
03:24:15.830 --> 03:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
standards are critically important to
 
03:24:17.590 --> 03:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
the food truck industry
 
03:24:19.990 --> 03:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
i've been in touch with the department
 
03:24:21.429 --> 03:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
of health and human services we're going
 
03:24:22.630 --> 03:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
to hear from them
 
03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:23.910 align:start position:0%
to hear from them
today

03:24:23.910 --> 03:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:24:25.590 --> 03:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
and they relayed some concerns from
 
03:24:28.550 --> 03:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
self-inspecting cities and towns that
 
03:24:30.790 --> 03:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
as the bill was originally drafted they
 
03:24:32.630 --> 03:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
would no longer have the authority to
 
03:24:34.790 --> 03:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
inspect food trucks
 
03:24:36.710 --> 03:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
so i asked the office of legislative
 
03:24:39.030 --> 03:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
services to draft an amendment that
 
03:24:41.190 --> 03:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
strikes the word inspect
 
03:24:45.110 --> 03:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
from line 16 the original bill
 
03:24:45.120 --> 03:24:46.070 align:start position:0%
from line 16 the original bill
and

03:24:46.070 --> 03:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:24:47.830 --> 03:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the amendment that i
 
03:24:51.030 --> 03:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
think has made its way around the room
 
03:24:53.190 --> 03:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh and it would be my expectation that
 
03:24:54.550 --> 03:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
03:24:56.870 --> 03:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
services would work through developing a
 
03:24:58.870 --> 03:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
common set of standards for licensing
 
03:24:58.880 --> 03:25:00.229 align:start position:0%
common set of standards for licensing
inspection

03:25:00.229 --> 03:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
03:25:01.910 --> 03:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
and enforcement through the rule making
 
03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:03.429 align:start position:0%
and enforcement through the rule making
process

03:25:03.429 --> 03:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:25:08.070 --> 03:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:09.590 --> 03:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that's
 
03:25:11.190 --> 03:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
03:25:12.870 --> 03:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's a good faith compromise it's aimed
 
03:25:14.550 --> 03:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
at addressing concerns raised by
 
03:25:16.389 --> 03:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
self-inspecting municipalities while
 
03:25:17.590 --> 03:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
staying true
 
03:25:19.830 --> 03:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
to the intent of the legislation house
 
03:25:22.710 --> 03:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
bill 1595 streamlines food truck
 
03:25:22.720 --> 03:25:23.910 align:start position:0%
bill 1595 streamlines food truck
licensing

03:25:23.910 --> 03:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
03:25:25.670 --> 03:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
at the state level it eliminates the
 
03:25:27.670 --> 03:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
need of our for our cities and towns to
 
03:25:29.670 --> 03:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
establish and enforce their own
 
03:25:31.590 --> 03:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
and it frees up these entrepreneurs to
 
03:25:34.070 --> 03:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
focus on what's most important earning a
 
03:25:36.229 --> 03:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
living serving their neighbors and
 
03:25:37.590 --> 03:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
creating jobs
 
03:25:39.590 --> 03:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
i urge committee members to send house
 
03:25:42.150 --> 03:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
bill 1595 to the house floor with a
 
03:25:44.950 --> 03:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
strong bipartisan ought to pass
 
03:25:47.269 --> 03:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
as amended recommendation and i welcome
 
03:25:48.389 --> 03:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
your questions
 
03:25:51.590 --> 03:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
03:25:54.150 --> 03:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
any comments yes representative bachelor
 
03:25:57.269 --> 03:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you sir um who will now
 
03:25:59.910 --> 03:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
inspect these uh these trucks i mean if
 
03:26:02.389 --> 03:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
they were being inspected i assume
 
03:26:04.950 --> 03:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
by these these listed towns manchester
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
portsmouth etc does the state have the
 
03:26:07.920 --> 03:26:08.710 align:start position:0%
portsmouth etc does the state have the
uh

03:26:08.710 --> 03:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:26:11.670 --> 03:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh the resources to do this
 
03:26:12.710 --> 03:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for the question
 
03:26:15.269 --> 03:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
representative uh my understanding with
 
03:26:17.750 --> 03:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note is that uh there would
 
03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
be resources put against that inspection
 
03:26:22.229 --> 03:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
process to make sure that
 
03:26:22.239 --> 03:26:23.429 align:start position:0%
process to make sure that
uh

03:26:23.429 --> 03:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:26:25.349 --> 03:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
all the the food trucks that are
 
03:26:25.359 --> 03:26:26.469 align:start position:0%
all the the food trucks that are
licensed

03:26:26.469 --> 03:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
03:26:28.550 --> 03:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh have passed inspection at the state
 
03:26:30.870 --> 03:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
level uh that said
 
03:26:33.349 --> 03:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
you know i think after talking with some
 
03:26:35.110 --> 03:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
food truck operators
 
03:26:36.870 --> 03:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know i think they welcome
 
03:26:39.269 --> 03:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for continued inspection
 
03:26:40.309 --> 03:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
they want to make sure that they're
 
03:26:41.590 --> 03:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing and that they're
 
03:26:44.229 --> 03:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
operating in a safe way
 
03:26:45.670 --> 03:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:26:47.030 --> 03:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know i think whether we're talking
 
03:26:47.040 --> 03:26:47.990 align:start position:0%
you know i think whether we're talking
about

03:26:47.990 --> 03:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:26:49.990 --> 03:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh health whether we're talking about
 
03:26:53.429 --> 03:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
safety uh you know fire
 
03:26:55.830 --> 03:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
i think you know we've got to figure out
 
03:26:58.469 --> 03:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
through through the rulemaking process
 
03:27:00.309 --> 03:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
what are all the standards that we're
 
03:27:01.590 --> 03:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh hold these food trucks to
 
03:27:05.750 --> 03:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
and how are we going to hold them
 
03:27:08.790 --> 03:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
accountable once they've been licensed
 
03:27:10.710 --> 03:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:27:12.630 --> 03:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
03:27:14.870 --> 03:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking a big question
 
03:27:14.880 --> 03:27:15.750 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking a big question
um

03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:17.750 --> 03:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
with the different
 
03:27:20.229 --> 03:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
towns or cities that have these licenses
 
03:27:21.670 --> 03:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
requirements now are they all
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
standardized betw across them are they
 
03:27:25.590 --> 03:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
all different now
 
03:27:26.710 --> 03:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
03:27:26.720 --> 03:27:27.830 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
question

03:27:27.830 --> 03:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:27:29.830 --> 03:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
they're all a little bit different from
 
03:27:31.349 --> 03:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
each other which is part of what makes
 
03:27:32.870 --> 03:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
it challenging for these food truck
 
03:27:32.880 --> 03:27:34.790 align:start position:0%
it challenging for these food truck
operators

03:27:34.790 --> 03:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
operators
 
03:27:37.110 --> 03:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
to operate in multiple municipalities
 
03:27:39.190 --> 03:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
and if there's an opportunity
 
03:27:41.990 --> 03:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
for example a food truck owner an
 
03:27:44.550 --> 03:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
operator who's based in manchester
 
03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh who sees an opportunity to
 
03:27:48.469 --> 03:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
participate in a community event in
 
03:27:48.479 --> 03:27:49.590 align:start position:0%
participate in a community event in
nashua

03:27:49.590 --> 03:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
03:27:51.190 --> 03:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
because their food truck operator
 
03:27:53.030 --> 03:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
friends say hey come come be part of
 
03:27:54.870 --> 03:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
this they're gonna then need to go
 
03:27:56.710 --> 03:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
through the process of
 
03:27:59.190 --> 03:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
getting licensed in
 
03:28:01.510 --> 03:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
nashua as well and there's you know
 
03:28:02.950 --> 03:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
additional fees
 
03:28:05.030 --> 03:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh and and those requirements could be a
 
03:28:06.469 --> 03:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
little bit different in nashua than they
 
03:28:08.070 --> 03:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
were in manchester than they were at the
 
03:28:09.750 --> 03:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
statewide level and those in there we're
 
03:28:12.309 --> 03:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
just talking about two municipalities
 
03:28:14.950 --> 03:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up
 
03:28:17.269 --> 03:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
yeah for the question may inquire
 
03:28:17.279 --> 03:28:18.229 align:start position:0%
yeah for the question may inquire
um

03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:18.239 --> 03:28:19.429 align:start position:0%
um
with

03:28:19.429 --> 03:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
so say there's a city or town that
 
03:28:23.910 --> 03:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any food truck requirements
 
03:28:25.910 --> 03:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
that truck can go to that town without
 
03:28:27.590 --> 03:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
any problems
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
is that is that what i'm understanding i
 
03:28:30.229 --> 03:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure i understand the
 
03:28:31.750 --> 03:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
whole thing the whole concept thanks for
 
03:28:33.750 --> 03:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
the follow-up that is my understanding
 
03:28:35.349 --> 03:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
again i put this bill i'm not a food
 
03:28:37.429 --> 03:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
truck expert however i put it in at the
 
03:28:39.670 --> 03:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
request of a constituent and that is my
 
03:28:41.030 --> 03:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
understanding though the folks from the
 
03:28:42.710 --> 03:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
03:28:43.910 --> 03:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll probably have a more
 
03:28:45.670 --> 03:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
complete answer all right thank you very
 
03:28:48.150 --> 03:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
much thank you some towns they have a
 
03:28:51.030 --> 03:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
visiting uh vendor requirement that if
 
03:28:52.469 --> 03:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
you're coming into town selling
 
03:28:52.479 --> 03:28:53.990 align:start position:0%
you're coming into town selling
something

03:28:53.990 --> 03:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:28:56.309 --> 03:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
that you're supposed to uh register with
 
03:28:57.830 --> 03:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
the town
 
03:28:57.840 --> 03:28:58.870 align:start position:0%
the town
so

03:28:58.870 --> 03:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:29:01.030 --> 03:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative terry
 
03:29:01.040 --> 03:29:02.150 align:start position:0%
representative terry
uh

03:29:02.150 --> 03:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:29:04.070 --> 03:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm thank you um
 
03:29:06.710 --> 03:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any other states that
 
03:29:08.870 --> 03:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
have statewide food truck licenses and
 
03:29:11.429 --> 03:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
if so uh would you would you tell me
 
03:29:13.349 --> 03:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
approximately how many states do and how
 
03:29:16.070 --> 03:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is similar or different or
 
03:29:17.670 --> 03:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
inspired by
 
03:29:21.269 --> 03:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
those those those laws
 
03:29:22.389 --> 03:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
03:29:25.110 --> 03:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
question uh there are
 
03:29:26.229 --> 03:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:29:28.790 --> 03:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
three or four other municipal or sorry
 
03:29:30.070 --> 03:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
three or four other states in the
 
03:29:31.990 --> 03:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
country that do have a statewide food
 
03:29:34.469 --> 03:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
truck license the closest one to us is
 
03:29:36.280 --> 03:29:36.290 align:start position:0%
the state of rhode island
 
03:29:36.290 --> 03:29:37.590 align:start position:0%
the state of rhode island
[Music]

03:29:37.590 --> 03:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:29:39.429 --> 03:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
03:29:41.269 --> 03:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
you know knowing that this was a request
 
03:29:43.910 --> 03:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
from a constituent who's who's sort of
 
03:29:45.910 --> 03:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
understanding the lay of the land of
 
03:29:47.590 --> 03:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
food truck industry
 
03:29:49.510 --> 03:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't be surprised if this you know
 
03:29:51.590 --> 03:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
came across her desk and she said oh
 
03:29:52.950 --> 03:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
this is something that maybe could work
 
03:29:58.790 --> 03:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:58.800 --> 03:30:02.469 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:30:02.469 --> 03:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:04.389 --> 03:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wilhelm did you
 
03:30:06.389 --> 03:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
speak to um someone from the health
 
03:30:08.550 --> 03:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
department in the city uh regarding this
 
03:30:08.560 --> 03:30:09.830 align:start position:0%
department in the city uh regarding this
bill

03:30:09.830 --> 03:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:30:14.070 --> 03:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
i did not well i i did at length and
 
03:30:14.080 --> 03:30:15.110 align:start position:0%
i did not well i i did at length and
they

03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:30:17.830 --> 03:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
don't feel that this bill is workable
 
03:30:21.110 --> 03:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
but i did suggest that on their website
 
03:30:22.790 --> 03:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
in the state website they could have a
 
03:30:25.429 --> 03:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
portal which can direct food truck
 
03:30:25.439 --> 03:30:27.030 align:start position:0%
portal which can direct food truck
owners

03:30:27.030 --> 03:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
owners
 
03:30:29.349 --> 03:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
just giving them you know direction on
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
how to operate in certain you know towns
 
03:30:35.349 --> 03:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
and cities so it really is a local rule
 
03:30:37.510 --> 03:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
local control issue
 
03:30:39.190 --> 03:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh but i'm sure we'll hear from the you
 
03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
know the state health department but you
 
03:30:42.469 --> 03:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
know my daughter has a food truck so
 
03:30:44.309 --> 03:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
i've been doing some research for her as
 
03:30:44.319 --> 03:30:45.750 align:start position:0%
i've been doing some research for her as
well

03:30:45.750 --> 03:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:30:48.389 --> 03:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
but i do i do agree it is very
 
03:30:48.399 --> 03:30:49.750 align:start position:0%
but i do i do agree it is very
cumbersome

03:30:49.750 --> 03:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
cumbersome
 
03:30:52.309 --> 03:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
not only for food trucks for but for you
 
03:30:52.319 --> 03:30:53.590 align:start position:0%
not only for food trucks for but for you
know

03:30:53.590 --> 03:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:30:55.110 --> 03:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
individuals that own restaurants that
 
03:30:56.550 --> 03:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
want to participate in a fair in
 
03:30:59.349 --> 03:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
manchester that's a whole other but very
 
03:31:01.510 --> 03:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
similar a lot of you know rules and
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
regulations and fees and so um thank you
 
03:31:08.950 --> 03:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:10.550 --> 03:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:31:12.389 --> 03:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
03:31:14.950 --> 03:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:16.630 --> 03:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh let's see
 
03:31:16.640 --> 03:31:18.229 align:start position:0%
uh let's see
um

03:31:18.229 --> 03:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:18.239 --> 03:31:20.710 align:start position:0%
um

03:31:39.190 --> 03:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:42.950 --> 03:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
hi everyone thanks for having me today

raised in manchester new hampshire i
 
03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
opened my first food truck in portland
 
03:31:55.030 --> 03:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
oregon in the year of 2018.
 
03:31:57.910 --> 03:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
i sold that food truck in 2020 moved
 
03:32:00.870 --> 03:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
back to manchester and i now operate a
 
03:32:03.510 --> 03:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
food truck in manchester and we've been
 
03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:10.550 --> 03:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
i don't have anything prepared but
 
03:32:14.229 --> 03:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
um i came here because i am in support
 
03:32:14.239 --> 03:32:15.269 align:start position:0%
um i came here because i am in support
of

03:32:15.269 --> 03:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:32:17.510 --> 03:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of you
 
03:32:17.520 --> 03:32:18.469 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of you
um

03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:21.269 --> 03:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
i'm parked at the factory on willow
 
03:32:23.670 --> 03:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
which is actually a brand new food truck
 
03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
pod there are four spots for food trucks
 
03:32:29.190 --> 03:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
um i was the first one
 
03:32:30.710 --> 03:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
to be parked there there's a second
 
03:32:32.150 --> 03:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
truck now and
 
03:32:34.070 --> 03:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
they're recruiting more more food trucks
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
to come and join um so
 
03:32:40.469 --> 03:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
i think that you know they're sending
 
03:32:43.349 --> 03:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
people my way and um wanting me to
 
03:32:45.349 --> 03:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
explain the process
 
03:32:47.750 --> 03:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm having a hard time you know
 
03:32:49.990 --> 03:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
helping them out because there is so
 
03:32:52.630 --> 03:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
many steps
 
03:32:56.070 --> 03:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
and as of right now i didn't get the new
 
03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire state
 
03:33:00.710 --> 03:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
license because i'm not operating
 
03:33:02.790 --> 03:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
outside of manchester
 
03:33:04.870 --> 03:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
but if i wanted to operate in any of the
 
03:33:07.429 --> 03:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
smaller towns not the 15 municipalities
 
03:33:09.429 --> 03:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
but any of the smaller towns i actually
 
03:33:11.190 --> 03:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do that either i'm
 
03:33:13.110 --> 03:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
basically only allowed to operate in
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
manchester right now
 
03:33:17.429 --> 03:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
which is fine i could actually i know
 
03:33:18.420 --> 03:33:18.430 align:start position:0%
that i could go
 
03:33:18.430 --> 03:33:19.590 align:start position:0%
that i could go
[Music]

03:33:19.590 --> 03:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:33:23.190 --> 03:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
through this state and get a 225 dollar
 
03:33:25.190 --> 03:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
license there's some there's a process
 
03:33:25.200 --> 03:33:26.950 align:start position:0%
license there's some there's a process
with

03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:33:29.510 --> 03:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know them coming out and inspecting
 
03:33:31.429 --> 03:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
the state statewide coming out to
 
03:33:33.030 --> 03:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
inspect and
 
03:33:35.030 --> 03:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
me sending in a floor plan and then i
 
03:33:36.389 --> 03:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
would have the ability to move
 
03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
throughout the state but not in any of
 
03:33:41.190 --> 03:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
the 15 municipalities only in smaller
 
03:33:43.030 --> 03:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
towns and then manchester where i'm
 
03:33:44.790 --> 03:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
currently licensed
 
03:33:46.950 --> 03:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
and then if i wanted to go to any of the
 
03:33:49.269 --> 03:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
larger cities which is where the money
 
03:33:51.590 --> 03:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
is for me you know um i'd have to go
 
03:33:53.510 --> 03:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
through their individual city clerk's
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
offices so
 
03:33:56.870 --> 03:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
i do think that this bill would
 
03:33:58.790 --> 03:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
streamline that process for a lot of
 
03:34:01.590 --> 03:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
food truck owners and um i do know one
 
03:34:03.750 --> 03:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
other food truck right now who
 
03:34:05.510 --> 03:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
they didn't they weren't aware of how
 
03:34:07.590 --> 03:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
long this process could possibly take
 
03:34:09.190 --> 03:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
for the licensing so they built their
 
03:34:11.269 --> 03:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
food truck out they put their money into
 
03:34:12.469 --> 03:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
their dream
 
03:34:14.150 --> 03:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
and it's just kind of sitting there and
 
03:34:15.830 --> 03:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for the bureaucratic
 
03:34:18.070 --> 03:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
process to to carry out which can take
 
03:34:20.309 --> 03:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
time and can be confusing and it
 
03:34:22.550 --> 03:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
involves a lot of different stops along
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
the way a lot of different checks that
 
03:34:26.150 --> 03:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
you're writing out to a lot of different
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
people and i think that streamlining
 
03:34:30.550 --> 03:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
that process would just make food trucks
 
03:34:32.229 --> 03:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
a lot more accessible to the people of
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:34:36.630 --> 03:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
and i welcome any questions
 
03:34:39.910 --> 03:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:41.830 --> 03:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming to our committee
 
03:34:43.110 --> 03:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
i appreciate this bill the spirit of
 
03:34:46.389 --> 03:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
this bill and this is what you believe
 
03:34:48.550 --> 03:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
would you believe i had a friend a few
 
03:34:50.389 --> 03:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
years ago that wanted to start a food
 
03:34:50.399 --> 03:34:51.269 align:start position:0%
years ago that wanted to start a food
truck

03:34:51.269 --> 03:34:51.279 align:start position:0%
truck
 
03:34:53.349 --> 03:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
in the town of goffstown and spent
 
03:34:54.870 --> 03:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
upwards of ten thousand dollars getting
 
03:34:57.590 --> 03:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
it ready and had to abandon the project
 
03:34:59.190 --> 03:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
because she couldn't find uh she
 
03:35:01.349 --> 03:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't find a location so
 
03:35:05.510 --> 03:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:05.520 --> 03:35:06.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:35:06.229 --> 03:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:35:11.910 --> 03:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:14.550 --> 03:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
my microphone
 
03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
from manchester i'm i'm always a little
 
03:35:17.520 --> 03:35:18.710 align:start position:0%
from manchester i'm i'm always a little
uh

03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:20.870 --> 03:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
closer i'm always a little defensive
 
03:35:23.190 --> 03:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
when i think that somebody
 
03:35:25.590 --> 03:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
is not going to pay the city for what it
 
03:35:25.600 --> 03:35:26.710 align:start position:0%
is not going to pay the city for what it
does

03:35:26.710 --> 03:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:35:26.720 --> 03:35:27.510 align:start position:0%
does
and

03:35:27.510 --> 03:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:30.630 --> 03:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
but the other part is
 
03:35:33.910 --> 03:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
these other steps you mentioned
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
what are they
 
03:35:38.550 --> 03:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and um so
 
03:35:39.910 --> 03:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
the steps are
 
03:35:42.469 --> 03:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
i went to the city clerk first and i got
 
03:35:44.950 --> 03:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
a peddler's and hawker's license
 
03:35:44.960 --> 03:35:46.150 align:start position:0%
a peddler's and hawker's license
application

03:35:46.150 --> 03:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
application
 
03:35:48.790 --> 03:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
that had a lot of different
 
03:35:50.630 --> 03:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
things that needed to be included so i
 
03:35:53.429 --> 03:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
did come here to the secretary of state
 
03:35:56.790 --> 03:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
and i got a state peddlers and honkers
 
03:35:59.190 --> 03:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
license which is something manchester
 
03:36:01.030 --> 03:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
city clerk required i'm not sure who
 
03:36:03.349 --> 03:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
else requires that but i drove here and
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
got that
 
03:36:07.670 --> 03:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
it involved obviously the inspections of
 
03:36:09.830 --> 03:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
the food truck which were fire
 
03:36:09.840 --> 03:36:11.429 align:start position:0%
the food truck which were fire
um

03:36:11.429 --> 03:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:13.750 --> 03:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
there was also the parks and rec sign
 
03:36:16.469 --> 03:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
off and the whole health inspection with
 
03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
the floor plan and all that stuff so
 
03:36:19.590 --> 03:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
that was kind of separate but it was
 
03:36:21.910 --> 03:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
attached to this peddlers and hawkers
 
03:36:21.920 --> 03:36:23.349 align:start position:0%
attached to this peddlers and hawkers
application

03:36:23.349 --> 03:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
application
 
03:36:24.870 --> 03:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
and there was also a five-year
 
03:36:27.030 --> 03:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
background check in any of the states
 
03:36:29.670 --> 03:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
i'd lived in in the past five years so
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
actually i was late opening my food
 
03:36:34.229 --> 03:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
truck by a week because i was waiting
 
03:36:35.990 --> 03:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
for the state of oregon
 
03:36:38.070 --> 03:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
to send me a background check for the
 
03:36:39.590 --> 03:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
past five years to make sure that i
 
03:36:42.150 --> 03:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't like a criminal even though i did
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
i did get a clear background check from
 
03:36:46.469 --> 03:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so there's just i think
 
03:36:47.990 --> 03:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
that that packet the peddlers and
 
03:36:49.910 --> 03:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
honkers might look different in the
 
03:36:51.750 --> 03:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
different municipalities but in
 
03:36:53.670 --> 03:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
manchester there was a lot of different
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
steps and a lot of different things that
 
03:36:57.510 --> 03:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
needed to be attached
 
03:36:59.030 --> 03:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
follow-on question
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
for the question main choir so um
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
the city of manchester had this
 
03:37:05.830 --> 03:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
peddler's license
 
03:37:08.710 --> 03:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
and they did some inspection work
 
03:37:08.720 --> 03:37:09.510 align:start position:0%
and they did some inspection work
or

03:37:09.510 --> 03:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:37:11.910 --> 03:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
just that's just for the license
 
03:37:13.670 --> 03:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
and then you went to concord
 
03:37:16.389 --> 03:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
and they charged you for
 
03:37:19.670 --> 03:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:21.590 --> 03:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes i did pay for the peddlers and
 
03:37:23.190 --> 03:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
honkers license which is a state
 
03:37:25.190 --> 03:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
peddlers and hawker's license i also
 
03:37:28.389 --> 03:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
paid for a background check
 
03:37:30.229 --> 03:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to get work through the
 
03:37:32.790 --> 03:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
checklist here the um
 
03:37:34.469 --> 03:37:34.479 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
03:37:37.830 --> 03:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
two peddlers and licenses
 
03:37:37.840 --> 03:37:39.110 align:start position:0%
two peddlers and licenses
uh

03:37:39.110 --> 03:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:41.190 --> 03:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
which i don't know why there are two if
 
03:37:43.510 --> 03:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
you're if you're going to be
 
03:37:45.750 --> 03:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
working in manchester
 
03:37:45.760 --> 03:37:47.030 align:start position:0%
working in manchester
but

03:37:47.030 --> 03:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:37:49.670 --> 03:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a five-year residency
 
03:37:49.680 --> 03:37:51.670 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a five-year residency
requirement

03:37:51.670 --> 03:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
03:37:53.910 --> 03:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
it was a five-year background check in
 
03:37:56.469 --> 03:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
any of the places that i was a resident
 
03:37:56.479 --> 03:37:57.349 align:start position:0%
any of the places that i was a resident
so

03:37:57.349 --> 03:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:59.110 --> 03:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
because i was a new hampshire resident
 
03:38:00.870 --> 03:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
within the past five years i needed a
 
03:38:02.389 --> 03:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
background check and because i was a
 
03:38:04.550 --> 03:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
resident of oregon within the past five
 
03:38:06.070 --> 03:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
years i needed an oregon background
 
03:38:08.309 --> 03:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
check if i had lived anywhere else in
 
03:38:10.309 --> 03:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
the past five years i would have needed
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:13.920 --> 03:38:15.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:38:15.190 --> 03:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:15.200 --> 03:38:15.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
i understand the background check that
 
03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me i i don't know about
 
03:38:21.830 --> 03:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
oregon but
 
03:38:24.309 --> 03:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
that's like did i have any priors but
 
03:38:26.309 --> 03:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
the background check says where have you
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:33.030 --> 03:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
and it could only be one year in oregon
 
03:38:37.349 --> 03:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:38.790 --> 03:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
all right so like
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
i can see things that could be done a
 
03:38:45.189 --> 03:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
little more smoothly but i still don't
 
03:38:47.030 --> 03:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
i still can't get away from the fact
 
03:38:47.040 --> 03:38:48.150 align:start position:0%
i still can't get away from the fact
that

03:38:48.150 --> 03:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
the cities are bringing to these
 
03:38:53.030 --> 03:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
business people
 
03:38:55.269 --> 03:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
populations places that you know that
 
03:38:56.469 --> 03:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
they can work
 
03:38:58.550 --> 03:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of support
 
03:39:01.590 --> 03:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
for them compared to a smaller town so i
 
03:39:04.150 --> 03:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
would be i would if you could clean it
 
03:39:04.160 --> 03:39:05.030 align:start position:0%
would be i would if you could clean it
up

03:39:05.030 --> 03:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:39:07.269 --> 03:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
and make it not so obtrusive
 
03:39:08.710 --> 03:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
then i would
 
03:39:10.710 --> 03:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
i would look a lot more kindly on it but
 
03:39:13.510 --> 03:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
yeah would you believe would you believe
 
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes okay we got it good good question
 
03:39:19.590 --> 03:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i have a question
 
03:39:24.070 --> 03:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
um hopefully you can answer somebody
 
03:39:26.070 --> 03:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
else um because i'm trying to understand
 
03:39:27.670 --> 03:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
the process let's say you're coming up
 
03:39:30.309 --> 03:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
to my community in north conway and you
 
03:39:32.150 --> 03:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
have a state you'll have a state line
 
03:39:35.189 --> 03:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
what the statewide license what else
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
would you need to do if you either
 
03:39:38.790 --> 03:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to park on a street or go to an
 
03:39:38.800 --> 03:39:41.429 align:start position:0%
wanted to park on a street or go to an
event

03:39:41.429 --> 03:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:43.189 --> 03:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
so yes i would need the statewide
 
03:39:45.189 --> 03:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
license to go to your community assuming
 
03:39:46.309 --> 03:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
it wasn't in one of the 13
 
03:39:46.319 --> 03:39:48.790 align:start position:0%
it wasn't in one of the 13
municipalities

03:39:48.790 --> 03:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:39:52.070 --> 03:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
i i'm as far as health and fire when it
 
03:39:54.389 --> 03:39:54.399 align:start position:0%
um in your in your community i'm not
 
03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
sure i'm assuming i would need to
 
03:39:56.160 --> 03:39:57.189 align:start position:0%
sure i'm assuming i would need to
approach

03:39:57.189 --> 03:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
approach
 
03:39:59.590 --> 03:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
health and fire or approach your your
 
03:39:59.600 --> 03:40:00.550 align:start position:0%
health and fire or approach your your
um

03:40:00.550 --> 03:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:02.790 --> 03:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
town hall and see if there's any kind of
 
03:40:04.870 --> 03:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
slip that does say like a daily event
 
03:40:07.189 --> 03:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
slip i know that they do that for
 
03:40:09.429 --> 03:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of pop-up events not necessarily
 
03:40:10.950 --> 03:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
for food trucks but for vendors like a
 
03:40:13.030 --> 03:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
farmer's market for example
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
i'd assume the process was was similar
 
03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
there if it wasn't in one of the 13
 
03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:20.309 align:start position:0%
there if it wasn't in one of the 13
municipalities

03:40:20.309 --> 03:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:40:22.229 --> 03:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
so follow up so you so you'd have to
 
03:40:24.550 --> 03:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
check with the individual town to see
 
03:40:26.950 --> 03:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
what else you needed to do right because
 
03:40:29.910 --> 03:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
the i it is my understanding that the
 
03:40:32.630 --> 03:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
the state license at this moment it may
 
03:40:34.389 --> 03:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
have to it is the department of health
 
03:40:35.830 --> 03:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
and human services so i know that they
 
03:40:37.429 --> 03:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
do require a floor plan and they come
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
and do an inspection so it's possible
 
03:40:43.590 --> 03:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
that if i had that maybe it was a 365
 
03:40:46.309 --> 03:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
day long application through the state
 
03:40:47.429 --> 03:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
the health department of health and
 
03:40:49.510 --> 03:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
human services that i'd be able to go to
 
03:40:51.429 --> 03:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
your community without any
 
03:40:53.429 --> 03:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
additional health or fire inspections
 
03:40:54.950 --> 03:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
and i could just show up if that makes
 
03:40:56.870 --> 03:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
sense if i have the state the state
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
license right now thank you
 
03:41:03.429 --> 03:41:03.439 align:start position:0%
representative him
 
03:41:04.469 --> 03:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:41:04.479 --> 03:41:05.349 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:41:05.349 --> 03:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:08.630 --> 03:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
if you get the state license
 
03:41:11.910 --> 03:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
does the state license cover you for
 
03:41:15.990 --> 03:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
on public property private parties um
 
03:41:17.990 --> 03:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
private property all kinds would it
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
cover everywhere you happen to
 
03:41:21.600 --> 03:41:22.389 align:start position:0%
cover everywhere you happen to
be

03:41:22.389 --> 03:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:41:24.630 --> 03:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
or are the different licenses you need
 
03:41:27.750 --> 03:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
for private property versus
 
03:41:27.760 --> 03:41:30.550 align:start position:0%
for private property versus
public

03:41:30.550 --> 03:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um i believe that that was
 
03:41:34.870 --> 03:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
where parks and rec came in when it came
 
03:41:37.990 --> 03:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
to manchester um but if it's a private
 
03:41:40.710 --> 03:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
event i think that i can be there if i'm
 
03:41:42.550 --> 03:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
licensed through the state assuming it's
 
03:41:44.710 --> 03:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
not in one of the 15 municipalities i
 
03:41:46.229 --> 03:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
think i can be
 
03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
private and
 
03:41:49.830 --> 03:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
i will i do want to mention that
 
03:41:51.750 --> 03:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
through the health department and the
 
03:41:54.070 --> 03:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
city clerk in manchester they did want
 
03:41:57.030 --> 03:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
to know they wanted a copy of my lease
 
03:41:58.870 --> 03:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
so it is important if it's public
 
03:42:01.189 --> 03:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
property or private property assuming
 
03:42:03.510 --> 03:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a private event i believe i
 
03:42:05.510 --> 03:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
mean i did need to provide a copy of my
 
03:42:07.830 --> 03:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
lease with the factory on willow so that
 
03:42:09.510 --> 03:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
they knew where and when i was going to
 
03:42:11.189 --> 03:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
be there and that i had permission to be
 
03:42:11.199 --> 03:42:12.550 align:start position:0%
be there and that i had permission to be
there

03:42:12.550 --> 03:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:42:14.229 --> 03:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
and i do have one other thing to say i
 
03:42:17.030 --> 03:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
just think in a perfect world i would be
 
03:42:19.590 --> 03:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
able to go through the state and get a
 
03:42:21.990 --> 03:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire food truck license
 
03:42:24.229 --> 03:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
i'd be able to go to any of the 15
 
03:42:26.389 --> 03:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well as any of the
 
03:42:28.469 --> 03:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
other towns in new hampshire however i
 
03:42:31.349 --> 03:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
do think and welcome that the larger
 
03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
cities the municipalities
 
03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
do continue to do the fire and health
 
03:42:38.309 --> 03:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
inspections on top of the state
 
03:42:40.229 --> 03:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
inspections i think that's what's most
 
03:42:42.790 --> 03:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
important but it would allow food truck
 
03:42:45.110 --> 03:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
operators to do what
 
03:42:46.710 --> 03:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
what they're meant to do you know when
 
03:42:48.150 --> 03:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
you think food truck you think you
 
03:42:50.389 --> 03:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
travel around and you sell your food to
 
03:42:52.150 --> 03:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
different communities and i think that
 
03:42:57.030 --> 03:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:58.790 --> 03:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative billio
 
03:43:00.710 --> 03:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:43:03.750 --> 03:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
did the um did the property owner where
 
03:43:07.429 --> 03:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
the food truck pad is did they
 
03:43:09.910 --> 03:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
give you any type of information
 
03:43:09.920 --> 03:43:11.189 align:start position:0%
give you any type of information
regarding

03:43:11.189 --> 03:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
03:43:13.269 --> 03:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
licensing for food trucks because you
 
03:43:14.710 --> 03:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
are leasing
 
03:43:17.670 --> 03:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
space there and did they give you
 
03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
a packet of information just say okay
 
03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
this is before you sign the lease
 
03:43:24.070 --> 03:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
this is what you need to do in
 
03:43:27.189 --> 03:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
manchester did they do that for you
 
03:43:29.349 --> 03:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question they did not
 
03:43:31.349 --> 03:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
um i think because that was more of a
 
03:43:34.309 --> 03:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
business transaction they assumed that i
 
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
as a food i mean it was just a lease and
 
03:43:39.670 --> 03:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
um they don't know
 
03:43:41.830 --> 03:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
they don't know you know they're it's a
 
03:43:43.670 --> 03:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
apartment building they don't know the
 
03:43:45.349 --> 03:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
rules so they
 
03:43:47.590 --> 03:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
they asked me to sign the lease and they
 
03:43:49.910 --> 03:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
did go over like for example they do not
 
03:43:52.309 --> 03:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
provide waste water
 
03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
removal so i found that on my own and
 
03:43:56.309 --> 03:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
they did require that i
 
03:43:57.910 --> 03:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
in state where i was going to be
 
03:44:00.389 --> 03:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
disposing of my waste water they did
 
03:44:02.309 --> 03:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
outline what was available to me through
 
03:44:04.710 --> 03:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
my lease which was you know 50 amps to
 
03:44:07.670 --> 03:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
plug into regularly as well as fresh
 
03:44:07.680 --> 03:44:08.710 align:start position:0%
plug into regularly as well as fresh
water

03:44:08.710 --> 03:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
water
 
03:44:11.189 --> 03:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
but they didn't give me any insight onto
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
how to get licensed because it's really
 
03:44:15.030 --> 03:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
just not their job i think they'd like
 
03:44:17.189 --> 03:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
to if they were more informed or if if
 
03:44:18.630 --> 03:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
they knew more
 
03:44:18.640 --> 03:44:19.510 align:start position:0%
they knew more
yes

03:44:19.510 --> 03:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:44:21.349 --> 03:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
i think it is their job because it is
 
03:44:23.429 --> 03:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
their property but i also wanted to know
 
03:44:26.550 --> 03:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
do you have a commissary there
 
03:44:30.070 --> 03:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
um i have a commissary kitchen it is not
 
03:44:32.150 --> 03:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
at that property because i own a meal
 
03:44:34.790 --> 03:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
prep company so i will say that in
 
03:44:36.790 --> 03:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
general the process of licensing my food
 
03:44:38.710 --> 03:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
truck was a little bit easier for me in
 
03:44:40.469 --> 03:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
that way because i am licensed with the
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
commissary but not because of my food
 
03:44:45.750 --> 03:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
truck because of my other business
 
03:44:48.229 --> 03:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
which is one llc so i already had a
 
03:44:50.070 --> 03:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
commissary kitchen
 
03:44:51.349 --> 03:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:44:53.349 --> 03:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
03:44:55.830 --> 03:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chair this is very um helpful
 
03:44:57.429 --> 03:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
to us because i don't think a lot of us
 
03:44:59.429 --> 03:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
know a whole lot about this
 
03:45:00.950 --> 03:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
um could you give me an idea of what the
 
03:45:03.429 --> 03:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
costs are for these various licenses
 
03:45:06.309 --> 03:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
and for the background check what do you
 
03:45:09.269 --> 03:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
what are your startup costs
 
03:45:11.990 --> 03:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um so i the one that i
 
03:45:13.830 --> 03:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
don't have which is this new hampshire
 
03:45:13.840 --> 03:45:15.030 align:start position:0%
don't have which is this new hampshire
state

03:45:15.030 --> 03:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:45:17.830 --> 03:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
license is 225 dollars for a mobile food
 
03:45:20.309 --> 03:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
unit i i decided not to get that one
 
03:45:21.910 --> 03:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
because i decided not to leave
 
03:45:21.920 --> 03:45:23.269 align:start position:0%
because i decided not to leave
manchester

03:45:23.269 --> 03:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
03:45:25.910 --> 03:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
um at the city clerk i believe that my
 
03:45:28.070 --> 03:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
peddlers and hawker's license and this
 
03:45:28.080 --> 03:45:28.950 align:start position:0%
peddlers and hawker's license and this
was

03:45:28.950 --> 03:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:45:34.469 --> 03:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
for myself two licenses was 100 150
 
03:45:37.030 --> 03:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
but if i were to get more so
 
03:45:38.469 --> 03:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
for example with the peddlers and
 
03:45:40.469 --> 03:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
hawkers license you aren't allowed to
 
03:45:42.630 --> 03:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
exchange money without it
 
03:45:42.640 --> 03:45:43.429 align:start position:0%
exchange money without it
so

03:45:43.429 --> 03:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:45.910 --> 03:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
when i hire a new individual to work for
 
03:45:48.070 --> 03:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
me i'll need to get them a badge as well
 
03:45:49.670 --> 03:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure if that fits into my
 
03:45:53.030 --> 03:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
current license but that was 150
 
03:45:55.189 --> 03:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
the health inspection
 
03:45:56.950 --> 03:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
without the commissary because i had
 
03:45:59.349 --> 03:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
already dealt with that i believe was
 
03:46:01.429 --> 03:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
around 300
 
03:46:01.439 --> 03:46:02.950 align:start position:0%
around 300
all-encompassing

03:46:02.950 --> 03:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing
 
03:46:04.790 --> 03:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
including the commissary for my original
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
space i did just renew and it was 325
 
03:46:07.920 --> 03:46:09.189 align:start position:0%
space i did just renew and it was 325
dollars

03:46:09.189 --> 03:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:46:09.199 --> 03:46:10.550 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:13.830 --> 03:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
so and then i think i wrote a check to
 
03:46:19.349 --> 03:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
um the background check for like 25
 
03:46:21.269 --> 03:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
and i think the secretary of state was
 
03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
about 50
 
03:46:25.910 --> 03:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 25 and 50. parks and
 
03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
rec didn't charge me they just signed
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
off because i was going to be legally on
 
03:46:32.150 --> 03:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
a private property where i had a lease
 
03:46:35.590 --> 03:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
and not in any kind of park
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
so i believe that was everything
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:48.150 --> 03:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:46:59.910 --> 03:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:03.269 --> 03:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:03.279 --> 03:47:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:47:04.870 --> 03:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:13.830 --> 03:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
yeah the button there you go
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
got it all right good afternoon members
 
03:47:20.229 --> 03:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is colleen
 
03:47:21.910 --> 03:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
smith i'm the administrator for the food
 
03:47:24.550 --> 03:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
protection section within dhhs
 
03:47:26.469 --> 03:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
03:47:28.389 --> 03:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
around 1595.
 
03:47:30.550 --> 03:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
as it stands now there is it's not a
 
03:47:34.870 --> 03:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
statewide food truck license we license
 
03:47:36.510 --> 03:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
all the
 
03:47:38.950 --> 03:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
217 cities and towns in new hampshire
 
03:47:41.590 --> 03:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
outside of the self-inspecting so a food
 
03:47:43.990 --> 03:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
a food truck or a mobile food unit as we
 
03:47:46.790 --> 03:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
define them can move about in the areas
 
03:47:47.990 --> 03:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we
 
03:47:50.389 --> 03:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
are under our jurisdiction but as was
 
03:47:52.389 --> 03:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned in previous testimony if they
 
03:47:53.670 --> 03:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
want to operate in one of those
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
self-inspecting jurisdictions such as
 
03:47:58.389 --> 03:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
manchester concord they'd have to obtain
 
03:48:00.550 --> 03:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
a permit from that city
 
03:48:03.030 --> 03:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
and as it was mentioned is it's not
 
03:48:06.309 --> 03:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
not necessarily limited to just a
 
03:48:07.750 --> 03:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
permit from the health department but it
 
03:48:10.150 --> 03:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
could involve other requirements as such
 
03:48:14.550 --> 03:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
um as as also as mentioned as we if if
 
03:48:19.349 --> 03:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass we do anticipate
 
03:48:21.590 --> 03:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
we need additional resources to take on
 
03:48:24.309 --> 03:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
the additional work um as as was
 
03:48:25.830 --> 03:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned before
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
if somebody was
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
operating exclusively in manchester they
 
03:48:32.150 --> 03:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't require our license for a
 
03:48:33.990 --> 03:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
health permit but
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
they would be inspected by that city
 
03:48:37.189 --> 03:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
health department
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
one of the other areas that the bill
 
03:48:41.110 --> 03:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't speak to is how to handle
 
03:48:43.910 --> 03:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
temporary events because
 
03:48:46.950 --> 03:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
exempt from a state license is anyone
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
operating in conjunction with a
 
03:48:50.950 --> 03:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
temporary event such as a fairer
 
03:48:53.590 --> 03:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
festival that's not longer than 14 days
 
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
in duration so this would be your fair
 
03:48:57.510 --> 03:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
like your deerfield fares your hopkinton
 
03:48:59.670 --> 03:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
fares those mobile food units that are
 
03:49:02.229 --> 03:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
operating exclusively there we don't
 
03:49:04.469 --> 03:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
license because they're exempt from a
 
03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
state food license however many of the
 
03:49:09.830 --> 03:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
cities and towns they that are
 
03:49:12.630 --> 03:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
self-inspecting they do issue temporary
 
03:49:15.269 --> 03:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
food licenses for those types of events
 
03:49:16.630 --> 03:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:49:18.469 --> 03:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
that's not if the state food truck
 
03:49:20.070 --> 03:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
license were to pass that isn't
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
addressed specifically if those cities
 
03:49:24.389 --> 03:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
and towns would still be able to do
 
03:49:27.030 --> 03:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
that temporary food permit
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
even if they had a statewide food
 
03:49:28.800 --> 03:49:30.070 align:start position:0%
even if they had a statewide food
license

03:49:30.070 --> 03:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:49:32.389 --> 03:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
um and i i know there are probably many
 
03:49:33.670 --> 03:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
questions about the the current
 
03:49:36.229 --> 03:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
regulation so i'm happy to answer those
 
03:49:39.910 --> 03:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay so help me out here so what is
 
03:49:43.990 --> 03:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
are we creating a new truck license
 
03:49:46.550 --> 03:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
so so as i understand the bill is if
 
03:49:49.590 --> 03:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
there was a new food truck license that
 
03:49:51.030 --> 03:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns that are
 
03:49:51.040 --> 03:49:52.790 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns that are
self-inspecting

03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
self-inspecting
 
03:49:55.349 --> 03:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
they they wouldn't be able to issue
 
03:49:57.269 --> 03:49:57.279 align:start position:0%
their own that the state their licenses
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
would supersede that's kind of that
 
03:50:01.030 --> 03:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
preemption which brings up a whole can
 
03:50:03.189 --> 03:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
of worms but i'm just trying to get down
 
03:50:03.199 --> 03:50:04.389 align:start position:0%
of worms but i'm just trying to get down
to

03:50:04.389 --> 03:50:04.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:50:06.630 --> 03:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
where what is the statute for
 
03:50:06.640 --> 03:50:07.429 align:start position:0%
where what is the statute for
the

03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:50:09.910 --> 03:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
because i keep seeing new new statute
 
03:50:11.510 --> 03:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
and and i look in here and it is a new
 
03:50:11.520 --> 03:50:12.950 align:start position:0%
and and i look in here and it is a new
statute

03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:50:12.960 --> 03:50:13.670 align:start position:0%
statute
so

03:50:13.670 --> 03:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:15.990 --> 03:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
do we have a statewide food truck
 
03:50:18.229 --> 03:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
license now
 
03:50:18.239 --> 03:50:19.030 align:start position:0%
license now
so

03:50:19.030 --> 03:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:21.910 --> 03:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
a food truck is defined as a food as a
 
03:50:24.070 --> 03:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
type of food establishment and so right
 
03:50:27.030 --> 03:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
now it fits into requiring a food
 
03:50:28.710 --> 03:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
license because it's offering food to
 
03:50:30.469 --> 03:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
the public and where we have
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction at the state health
 
03:50:34.469 --> 03:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
department is those
 
03:50:37.110 --> 03:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
all all but the 15 self-inspecting
 
03:50:39.189 --> 03:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
cities and towns though
 
03:50:41.510 --> 03:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
any food establishment currently in one
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
of those that falls to the local
 
03:50:45.030 --> 03:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
municipality for
 
03:50:47.670 --> 03:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
food licensing and inspection
 
03:50:50.469 --> 03:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
so it's that this license when you say
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
state license statewide license not
 
03:50:54.150 --> 03:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
withstanding the communities have their
 
03:50:54.160 --> 03:50:55.269 align:start position:0%
withstanding the communities have their
own

03:50:55.269 --> 03:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
own
 
03:50:57.590 --> 03:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
it it's also for restaurants it's the
 
03:50:59.510 --> 03:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
same license for restaurants same it's
 
03:51:02.309 --> 03:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
everybody it's not it's not anything to
 
03:51:04.229 --> 03:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
do about having wheels and moving
 
03:51:07.030 --> 03:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
correct it is a type of license so a
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
restaurant is one type of license yeah
 
03:51:11.110 --> 03:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
so what what is the one that that people
 
03:51:12.950 --> 03:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
would be falling under now
 
03:51:14.790 --> 03:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
so it's it's under our regular food
 
03:51:17.910 --> 03:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
license food licensing
 
03:51:19.590 --> 03:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
143 a4
 
03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
license required yes
 
03:51:24.309 --> 03:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
okay so that doesn't get you anything
 
03:51:26.150 --> 03:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
about traveling or moving or anything
 
03:51:28.870 --> 03:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
just that's just the license to
 
03:51:31.269 --> 03:51:31.279 align:start position:0%
to have and gets you guys on record so
 
03:51:33.510 --> 03:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know that there's somebody
 
03:51:35.910 --> 03:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
selling food out of that location right
 
03:51:38.309 --> 03:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
so so in essence the issue the license
 
03:51:40.550 --> 03:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's issued by the state isn't
 
03:51:43.110 --> 03:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
isn't statewide in that you can operate
 
03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
in the self-inspecting cities and towns
 
03:51:46.630 --> 03:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
without their license similar to a
 
03:51:48.550 --> 03:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant if a restaurant was in
 
03:51:50.309 --> 03:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
manchester or concord they'd have to go
 
03:51:52.550 --> 03:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
to the local the health department so
 
03:51:56.070 --> 03:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:58.790 --> 03:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
the people who have these trucks and
 
03:51:58.800 --> 03:52:00.469 align:start position:0%
the people who have these trucks and
campers

03:52:00.469 --> 03:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
campers
 
03:52:00.479 --> 03:52:01.670 align:start position:0%
campers
um

03:52:01.670 --> 03:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:04.950 --> 03:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
they get this license to with you
 
03:52:07.110 --> 03:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
and then most of towns they just have a
 
03:52:10.389 --> 03:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
code enforcement or whatever whatever
 
03:52:13.349 --> 03:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
and comes in and looks at it and and and
 
03:52:16.469 --> 03:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
treats it like any other restaurant
 
03:52:18.630 --> 03:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
yes okay it had nothing to do whether it
 
03:52:20.389 --> 03:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
might be in that town that day versus
 
03:52:22.229 --> 03:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
going to another town another day it
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
would be based upon that day okay now i
 
03:52:28.150 --> 03:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
get it representative
 
03:52:29.269 --> 03:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm going to ask the same
 
03:52:31.590 --> 03:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
question of you as i did of the sponsor
 
03:52:35.750 --> 03:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh from your perspective uh at the state
 
03:52:38.229 --> 03:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh department that regulates here are
 
03:52:39.990 --> 03:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any other states that
 
03:52:40.000 --> 03:52:40.870 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any other states that
have

03:52:40.870 --> 03:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:52:43.429 --> 03:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
the type of uh have laws that are
 
03:52:45.269 --> 03:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
similar to the one that's proposed in
 
03:52:47.030 --> 03:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
03:52:48.870 --> 03:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
um and if
 
03:52:51.670 --> 03:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh that's part a to the question
 
03:52:51.680 --> 03:52:52.469 align:start position:0%
uh that's part a to the question
uh

03:52:52.469 --> 03:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:52:52.479 --> 03:52:53.189 align:start position:0%
uh
and

03:52:53.189 --> 03:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:55.269 --> 03:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
could you compare and contrast with with
 
03:52:55.279 --> 03:52:56.469 align:start position:0%
could you compare and contrast with with
respect

03:52:56.469 --> 03:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
respect
 
03:52:59.269 --> 03:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
to this proposed legislation
 
03:53:01.590 --> 03:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
um and and then part b are you aware of
 
03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
any other states
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
that effectively bifurcate between towns
 
03:53:07.269 --> 03:53:07.279 align:start position:0%
and cities
 
03:53:10.070 --> 03:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh in the issuing of uh food truck
 
03:53:12.550 --> 03:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
licenses thank you
 
03:53:16.630 --> 03:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
so i don't know the the exact number um
 
03:53:18.070 --> 03:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
as representative wilhelm mentioned
 
03:53:20.389 --> 03:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
before that seems reas reasonable there
 
03:53:23.110 --> 03:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
are there are a few states that are
 
03:53:24.950 --> 03:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
centralized rhode island being one of
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
them where they handle all food
 
03:53:28.790 --> 03:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
licensing they don't handle they don't
 
03:53:30.070 --> 03:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
handle and they don't have
 
03:53:33.110 --> 03:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities that individually license
 
03:53:35.110 --> 03:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
our neighbor to the south massachusetts
 
03:53:36.389 --> 03:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
every single town
 
03:53:38.790 --> 03:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
has their own licensing authority they
 
03:53:40.950 --> 03:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
so there is no state
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
food inspection program for restaurants
 
03:53:45.429 --> 03:53:45.439 align:start position:0%
each individual city in town does the
 
03:53:47.750 --> 03:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
food licensing so it's it's really
 
03:53:49.830 --> 03:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
patchwork across the country new
 
03:53:52.389 --> 03:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire is is kind of a hybrid where
 
03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
much most of the state is handled by the
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
state health department but we do have
 
03:54:00.389 --> 03:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
those 15 self-inspecting municipalities
 
03:54:02.550 --> 03:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
okay representative bartlett
 
03:54:04.389 --> 03:54:04.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:54:09.030 --> 03:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:10.550 --> 03:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of how many of
 
03:54:12.229 --> 03:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
these licenses
 
03:54:14.309 --> 03:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
are i i'm guessing that there's a
 
03:54:14.319 --> 03:54:15.429 align:start position:0%
are i i'm guessing that there's a
turnover

03:54:15.429 --> 03:54:15.439 align:start position:0%
turnover
 
03:54:17.349 --> 03:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
each year because you don't see
 
03:54:17.359 --> 03:54:19.830 align:start position:0%
each year because you don't see
old

03:54:19.830 --> 03:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
old
 
03:54:22.469 --> 03:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
it long in business food trucks
 
03:54:23.990 --> 03:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
but you have an idea of how many
 
03:54:26.389 --> 03:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
licenses you might issue in a year for
 
03:54:29.269 --> 03:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
food trucks we have we have well over
 
03:54:32.309 --> 03:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
200 and i don't have information i could
 
03:54:35.110 --> 03:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
i can try to find for you how many
 
03:54:37.269 --> 03:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
how it would be a little bit hard for us
 
03:54:39.110 --> 03:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
to find out how many are turning over on
 
03:54:41.750 --> 03:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
a year-to-year basis um definitely we
 
03:54:43.830 --> 03:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
have seen growth in this class and
 
03:54:46.710 --> 03:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
category of license over the last
 
03:54:48.710 --> 03:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
10 years they're definitely becoming
 
03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
more popular than than they were
 
03:54:52.630 --> 03:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
and maybe even related to the the
 
03:54:55.990 --> 03:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic it also could could have
 
03:54:58.150 --> 03:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
caused the increase in the number of
 
03:54:58.160 --> 03:55:00.150 align:start position:0%
caused the increase in the number of
them

03:55:00.150 --> 03:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:55:02.870 --> 03:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
for the question main choir thank you um
 
03:55:05.429 --> 03:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
and and do you have to do an on-site
 
03:55:07.830 --> 03:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
inspection of each of these trucks each
 
03:55:07.840 --> 03:55:09.110 align:start position:0%
inspection of each of these trucks each
year

03:55:09.110 --> 03:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:55:10.229 --> 03:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
so we
 
03:55:13.030 --> 03:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily inspect them annually
 
03:55:13.040 --> 03:55:14.550 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily inspect them annually
they

03:55:14.550 --> 03:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:55:16.630 --> 03:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
it would probably be from one to two
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
years of an inspection depend it's where
 
03:55:21.349 --> 03:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
you do them risk-based so depending on
 
03:55:23.830 --> 03:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
their menu that's that's how they how
 
03:55:25.990 --> 03:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
frequently they'd be inspected
 
03:55:27.189 --> 03:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
let me ask one more question further
 
03:55:29.590 --> 03:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you um
 
03:55:31.670 --> 03:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:55:33.110 --> 03:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
so if you're
 
03:55:35.030 --> 03:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
so let's say every two years they get
 
03:55:35.040 --> 03:55:36.309 align:start position:0%
so let's say every two years they get
inspected

03:55:36.309 --> 03:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
03:55:36.319 --> 03:55:37.670 align:start position:0%
inspected
um

03:55:37.670 --> 03:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:39.670 --> 03:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm thinking about the costs and
 
03:55:41.349 --> 03:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
what the licensing does and how long has
 
03:55:43.990 --> 03:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
it been since the license fee has been
 
03:55:44.000 --> 03:55:45.189 align:start position:0%
it been since the license fee has been
changed

03:55:45.189 --> 03:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
changed
 
03:55:47.590 --> 03:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
so for this cloud class and category
 
03:55:49.349 --> 03:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
actually for all our food licensing we
 
03:55:52.309 --> 03:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
haven't increased our fees since 2009.
 
03:55:55.030 --> 03:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:55:56.630 --> 03:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative mack later uh thank you
 
03:55:59.349 --> 03:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt um i think what you said
 
03:56:01.590 --> 03:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
was that if a state law passes that
 
03:56:04.630 --> 03:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
would preclude the the city laws is
 
03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
there any reason you can't do both in
 
03:56:09.110 --> 03:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
other words we have a state law but if
 
03:56:11.030 --> 03:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
the city decides to
 
03:56:14.710 --> 03:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh to handle this licensing themselves
 
03:56:16.229 --> 03:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
that they could opt to do it i think
 
03:56:18.309 --> 03:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
that was somewhat what the
 
03:56:20.630 --> 03:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative terry was a direction he
 
03:56:23.110 --> 03:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
was going so we could have both
 
03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
why not
 
03:56:27.750 --> 03:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
or could we have both
 
03:56:30.550 --> 03:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
so so that might um
 
03:56:32.389 --> 03:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
but it's right now they could they could
 
03:56:32.399 --> 03:56:33.110 align:start position:0%
but it's right now they could they could
have

03:56:33.110 --> 03:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:56:34.950 --> 03:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
an operator could have both they could
 
03:56:36.469 --> 03:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
have a license to operate within the
 
03:56:39.670 --> 03:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
state i think the tricky part is how to
 
03:56:41.670 --> 03:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
navigate the the self-inspecting
 
03:56:44.150 --> 03:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities with them
 
03:56:45.990 --> 03:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know some you know for instance if
 
03:56:48.150 --> 03:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
someone wanted to operate in in hooksett
 
03:56:50.630 --> 03:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
nashua concord and manchester that could
 
03:56:53.990 --> 03:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
be for food licenses for for them as it
 
03:56:56.070 --> 03:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
is now
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
right so
 
03:56:57.359 --> 03:56:58.229 align:start position:0%
right so
really

03:56:58.229 --> 03:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:57:00.550 --> 03:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't want double jeopardy here
 
03:57:00.560 --> 03:57:01.349 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't want double jeopardy here
either

03:57:01.349 --> 03:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:57:03.429 --> 03:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
having two licenses like who's really in
 
03:57:03.439 --> 03:57:04.389 align:start position:0%
having two licenses like who's really in
charge

03:57:04.389 --> 03:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
charge
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
so it really the statute should say is
 
03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:08.790 align:start position:0%
so it really the statute should say is
if

03:57:08.790 --> 03:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:57:11.910 --> 03:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
if you have uh if you want uh do a town
 
03:57:13.670 --> 03:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
03:57:13.680 --> 03:57:14.950 align:start position:0%
that's not
currently

03:57:14.950 --> 03:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:57:17.429 --> 03:57:17.439 align:start position:0%
one of the 15 or 13 towns
 
03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
then you could get a state license okay
 
03:57:23.110 --> 03:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
you might still have two if you go back
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
and forth between one town and a city
 
03:57:27.750 --> 03:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day
 
03:57:29.670 --> 03:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
that the
 
03:57:31.269 --> 03:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
03:57:33.110 --> 03:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me the city
 
03:57:36.469 --> 03:57:36.479 align:start position:0%
has jurisdiction over that city so that
 
03:57:38.309 --> 03:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
we should be writing this state statute
 
03:57:40.389 --> 03:57:40.399 align:start position:0%
and i would say would you agree whether
 
03:57:41.830 --> 03:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
you write the state statute we should
 
03:57:44.710 --> 03:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
say this is only if you're not in a town
 
03:57:48.150 --> 03:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
that has its own license
 
03:57:50.150 --> 03:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
that this license should only be good if
 
03:57:52.309 --> 03:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
you know even though manchester requires
 
03:57:54.710 --> 03:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
you to go get one
 
03:57:57.670 --> 03:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
but that but that we have to decide who
 
03:57:59.830 --> 03:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day who's uh who's
 
03:58:02.630 --> 03:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
your authority in a given place
 
03:58:05.830 --> 03:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
so if you're if you're in a city it's
 
03:58:07.750 --> 03:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
going to be that city if you're in the
 
03:58:11.750 --> 03:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
town it can be it would be the state
 
03:58:13.510 --> 03:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
right right i think that that's how it
 
03:58:16.229 --> 03:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
is working right now is that all right
 
03:58:18.150 --> 03:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
but this bill doesn't say this this bill
 
03:58:19.910 --> 03:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
it appears to say
 
03:58:21.510 --> 03:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
if you have the state win then you don't
 
03:58:23.349 --> 03:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
need to have the local one and that can
 
03:58:23.359 --> 03:58:24.229 align:start position:0%
need to have the local one and that can
be

03:58:24.229 --> 03:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
that can be a that a problem
 
03:58:30.550 --> 03:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
yes okay um so uh the the fiscal note
 
03:58:30.560 --> 03:58:32.150 align:start position:0%
yes okay um so uh the the fiscal note
says

03:58:32.150 --> 03:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
says
 
03:58:35.990 --> 03:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
225 dollars for 175 licenses which was
 
03:58:39.429 --> 03:58:39.439 align:start position:0%
the 175. so we had surveyed the the
 
03:58:41.349 --> 03:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
number of mobile food units that are in
 
03:58:43.429 --> 03:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
the self-inspecting jurisdiction so if
 
03:58:46.550 --> 03:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
we were to license all 100 approximately
 
03:58:49.110 --> 03:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
175 of those that that's where that
 
03:58:51.830 --> 03:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
figure came into so in addition to the
 
03:58:54.630 --> 03:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
200 plus that are in the state currently
 
03:58:58.309 --> 03:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
there are about 175 food trucks within
 
03:59:00.790 --> 03:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
the self-inspecting communities okay so
 
03:59:03.269 --> 03:59:03.279 align:start position:0%
i guess what i what i want to know is uh
 
03:59:05.830 --> 03:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
are we is the money coming from peter to
 
03:59:08.790 --> 03:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
pay paul because this dollar amount does
 
03:59:10.710 --> 03:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
not make enough for the person who's
 
03:59:13.590 --> 03:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
going to need to be hired
 
03:59:15.510 --> 03:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
right right that's um
 
03:59:15.520 --> 03:59:17.110 align:start position:0%
right right that's um
that's

03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:59:18.550 --> 03:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
that's one of the
 
03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
difficulties is that we would definitely
 
03:59:22.710 --> 03:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
need an additional staff person to take
 
03:59:25.269 --> 03:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
on this additional right and the two and
 
03:59:26.790 --> 03:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
if we were to do that we probably need
 
03:59:29.429 --> 03:59:29.439 align:start position:0%
to raise the fee because it won't pay
 
03:59:31.670 --> 03:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
for the pay for the position if there's
 
03:59:35.590 --> 03:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:35.600 --> 03:59:38.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:59:38.550 --> 03:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:41.189 --> 03:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
any question representative bros
 
03:59:43.670 --> 03:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
this is a would you believe um
 
03:59:45.429 --> 03:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
would you believe in my community a
 
03:59:47.670 --> 03:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
group of high school students started a
 
03:59:49.590 --> 03:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
food truck cheese louise
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
and it has grown into a significant
 
03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
business they now have two restaurants
 
03:59:56.229 --> 03:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
in two different states and they hire a
 
03:59:59.110 --> 03:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
significant number of people so i so i i
 
04:00:01.030 --> 04:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
think it behooves us to try to make this
 
04:00:03.830 --> 04:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
process as simple and as cost effective
 
04:00:05.349 --> 04:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
as possible because these these folks
 
04:00:07.590 --> 04:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
are now employing a sizable group of
 
04:00:07.600 --> 04:00:08.389 align:start position:0%
are now employing a sizable group of
people

04:00:08.389 --> 04:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:00:10.550 --> 04:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
and they have an excellent product thank
 
04:00:10.560 --> 04:00:11.990 align:start position:0%
and they have an excellent product thank
you

04:00:11.990 --> 04:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:00:15.429 --> 04:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay everybody else had oh
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative bowling yeah
 
04:00:21.110 --> 04:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:00:23.910 --> 04:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
if you if you're a food truck um in the
 
04:00:26.150 --> 04:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
state do you need a
 
04:00:28.550 --> 04:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
peddler's license and
 
04:00:30.550 --> 04:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
a license to operate
 
04:00:32.550 --> 04:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
the food truck as a restaurant because a
 
04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
food truck is a restaurant
 
04:00:35.279 --> 04:00:36.870 align:start position:0%
food truck is a restaurant
so

04:00:36.870 --> 04:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:38.870 --> 04:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
a peddler's license applies to food
 
04:00:41.030 --> 04:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
vendors and in any vendor as it was
 
04:00:43.110 --> 04:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned before that exchange of money
 
04:00:44.950 --> 04:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
i don't i can't answer the question
 
04:00:47.830 --> 04:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
about each individual municipality that
 
04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
requirement but i do know
 
04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
there is that state hackers and peddlers
 
04:00:56.309 --> 04:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:58.229 --> 04:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
04:01:00.229 --> 04:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so just so
 
04:01:04.150 --> 04:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
i can understand it so not only when a
 
04:01:06.150 --> 04:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
person wants to open a food truck
 
04:01:08.389 --> 04:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
business that's not doesn't fall into
 
04:01:10.790 --> 04:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
one of these jurisdictions
 
04:01:12.389 --> 04:01:12.399 align:start position:0%
they would need to come in and get a
 
04:01:14.150 --> 04:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
food truck license
 
04:01:16.710 --> 04:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
as a restaurant or a restaurant and a
 
04:01:18.229 --> 04:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
peddler's license so they have to pay
 
04:01:19.750 --> 04:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
for two
 
04:01:21.349 --> 04:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
fees and then if they want to go into
 
04:01:23.189 --> 04:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
one of these businesses they could
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
potentially have to pay for two more
 
04:01:28.070 --> 04:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
fees at this at the local levels to be
 
04:01:30.830 --> 04:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
able to operate in those communities
 
04:01:35.590 --> 04:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
also so you're looking at four
 
04:01:38.309 --> 04:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
so so for a mo any mobile vendor or
 
04:01:38.319 --> 04:01:39.590 align:start position:0%
so so for a mo any mobile vendor or
mobile

04:01:39.590 --> 04:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
mobile
 
04:01:41.670 --> 04:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
whether it mobile food whether it's
 
04:01:43.269 --> 04:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
they're selling t-shirts they're
 
04:01:44.550 --> 04:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
required to get that hawkers and
 
04:01:47.030 --> 04:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
peddlers license if they're selling food
 
04:01:48.950 --> 04:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
they all in the state's jurisdiction
 
04:01:50.790 --> 04:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
then they have to receive a food license
 
04:01:53.590 --> 04:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
from us if they want to operate in a in
 
04:01:55.189 --> 04:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
the states jurisdiction and the city
 
04:01:57.269 --> 04:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
then they also need to meet the city
 
04:01:59.269 --> 04:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
requirements which may involve a health
 
04:02:00.950 --> 04:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
permit and a hawkers and peddler's
 
04:02:03.910 --> 04:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
license right the answer so the question
 
04:02:05.910 --> 04:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
is if you're doing two different doing a
 
04:02:07.590 --> 04:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
city and a town
 
04:02:09.189 --> 04:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
yes there's you would have to get four
 
04:02:11.429 --> 04:02:11.439 align:start position:0%
licenses yeah that's i just want to make
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
sure i understood it you don't want to
 
04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:18.950 --> 04:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative bartlett
 
04:02:21.269 --> 04:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so um basically from
 
04:02:23.189 --> 04:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
these numbers that we're looking at
 
04:02:25.269 --> 04:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
um it would seem to me that we're
 
04:02:27.030 --> 04:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
i mean pretty much the license is the
 
04:02:29.830 --> 04:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
service for the inspections
 
04:02:31.670 --> 04:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
because it's not a program that pays for
 
04:02:31.680 --> 04:02:33.269 align:start position:0%
because it's not a program that pays for
itself

04:02:33.269 --> 04:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
itself
 
04:02:34.790 --> 04:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
even so
 
04:02:34.800 --> 04:02:35.990 align:start position:0%
even so
so

04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:39.830 --> 04:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
so over overall our program is is pretty
 
04:02:42.389 --> 04:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much revenue neutral and in
 
04:02:44.790 --> 04:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
the amount of licensing revenue that we
 
04:02:46.870 --> 04:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
generate and then the the cost to run
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
our program and so that but just this
 
04:02:52.229 --> 04:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
this additional work is would be a it
 
04:02:53.910 --> 04:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
would be above and beyond and then it's
 
04:02:53.920 --> 04:02:56.469 align:start position:0%
would be above and beyond and then it's
also

04:02:56.469 --> 04:02:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
more expanding the geography also
 
04:03:01.189 --> 04:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
knowing that we don't normally go in to
 
04:03:02.630 --> 04:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
do inspections in in these
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:08.630 --> 04:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
we have to come up with more money for
 
04:03:10.389 --> 04:03:10.399 align:start position:0%
the state inspections
 
04:03:13.670 --> 04:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
or the vendors that need the inspection
 
04:03:15.910 --> 04:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
need to pay for it
 
04:03:18.950 --> 04:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
if it was to be uh cost neutral yes okay
 
04:03:22.870 --> 04:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:26.469 --> 04:03:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:35.510 --> 04:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:37.349 --> 04:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh hi mr chairman committee thank you
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
again this will be my last time
 
04:03:39.750 --> 04:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
appearing today
 
04:03:42.070 --> 04:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
um so the science bartlett center for
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
public policy is the free market
 
04:03:45.750 --> 04:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
organization new hampshire
 
04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh we are here to testify on this bill
 
04:03:50.229 --> 04:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
we've done some research on on food
 
04:03:52.630 --> 04:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
truck regulations in new hampshire and
 
04:03:54.790 --> 04:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
iron i read of this bill
 
04:03:56.150 --> 04:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
is this
 
04:03:57.510 --> 04:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
creates a
 
04:04:00.070 --> 04:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
truly for the first time statewide food
 
04:04:01.349 --> 04:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
truck license
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
as you've heard and just to
 
04:04:06.150 --> 04:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
maybe explain a little better the
 
04:04:07.830 --> 04:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
current system requires food truck
 
04:04:07.840 --> 04:04:08.950 align:start position:0%
current system requires food truck
vendors

04:04:08.950 --> 04:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
04:04:10.950 --> 04:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
to get a state permit
 
04:04:13.349 --> 04:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
but then also if they want to serve in
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
any of the 15 municipalities that that
 
04:04:19.349 --> 04:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
are self-regulated they have to purchase
 
04:04:21.670 --> 04:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
annually a separate
 
04:04:23.670 --> 04:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
vendor permit in each of those
 
04:04:25.750 --> 04:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
communities so when we a couple years
 
04:04:27.349 --> 04:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
ago did a big report on food trucks in
 
04:04:29.349 --> 04:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire which are very popular
 
04:04:30.870 --> 04:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
among the younger crowd and if you're
 
04:04:32.710 --> 04:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
talking about stay work play trying to
 
04:04:34.550 --> 04:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
attract young people food trucks are a
 
04:04:36.070 --> 04:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
quality of life issue
 
04:04:39.269 --> 04:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
for folks in their 20s 30s and 40s
 
04:04:41.349 --> 04:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic
 
04:04:44.150 --> 04:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
there was a 70 percent increase in food
 
04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
truck application the the license
 
04:04:49.429 --> 04:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
applications at the state level for food
 
04:04:51.269 --> 04:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
truck vendors in the three and a half
 
04:04:53.349 --> 04:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
years before the pandemic started
 
04:04:55.429 --> 04:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
and yet what municipalities saw was
 
04:04:57.269 --> 04:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a significant increase in
 
04:04:59.269 --> 04:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
actual food trucks on the road
 
04:05:00.950 --> 04:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
and that's because of the municipal
 
04:05:02.469 --> 04:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
license problems
 
04:05:04.870 --> 04:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
people would not be able to go from one
 
04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
municipality to another to another so i
 
04:05:08.710 --> 04:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
interviewed a food truck vendor
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
who spent more than fifteen hundred
 
04:05:13.429 --> 04:05:13.439 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
04:05:15.590 --> 04:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
getting permits in a region around
 
04:05:17.910 --> 04:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
southern new hampshire and northern
 
04:05:17.920 --> 04:05:19.269 align:start position:0%
southern new hampshire and northern
massachusetts

04:05:19.269 --> 04:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
04:05:21.429 --> 04:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
so just to give you an example now this
 
04:05:21.439 --> 04:05:22.150 align:start position:0%
so just to give you an example now this
is

04:05:22.150 --> 04:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:05:22.160 --> 04:05:22.950 align:start position:0%
is
these

04:05:22.950 --> 04:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
permits might have gone up but when i
 
04:05:26.150 --> 04:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
did the story
 
04:05:29.910 --> 04:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
212 in concord 250 in another town 200
 
04:05:32.309 --> 04:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
in another town 150 in another town
 
04:05:34.229 --> 04:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
you're quickly adding up so what this
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
would do is allow the state
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
health department
 
04:05:38.640 --> 04:05:39.429 align:start position:0%
health department
to

04:05:39.429 --> 04:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
license and inspect the food trucks so
 
04:05:43.750 --> 04:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
they would be inspected
 
04:05:45.030 --> 04:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
and then you could truly drive them
 
04:05:49.030 --> 04:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
around and the local municipality
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
could still have food truck regulations
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
they can regulate location
 
04:05:55.670 --> 04:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
04:05:57.030 --> 04:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
which nobody's taking that away from
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
them and in the bottom of the bill you
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
see the last line of the bill my
 
04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
computer screen went black uh billing
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
but you can read it um
 
04:06:06.229 --> 04:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
it allows them to have a few other
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
regulatory so you're not taking
 
04:06:09.030 --> 04:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
everything away from the municipalities
 
04:06:10.630 --> 04:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
but what you are doing is
 
04:06:12.229 --> 04:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
consolidating it into a statewide
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
license so that people can truly
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
offer these popular
 
04:06:19.510 --> 04:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
food trucks all around the state so we
 
04:06:20.710 --> 04:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
think it would be
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
a good bill it would
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
increase competition and allow people to
 
04:06:27.910 --> 04:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
provide a service at lower cost that is
 
04:06:29.510 --> 04:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
really in high demand in new hampshire
 
04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
right now and we hear
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
um you know if you talk to to folks in
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
manchester at their office their
 
04:06:38.309 --> 04:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
licensing office and portsmouth
 
04:06:40.630 --> 04:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
they get queries all the time from
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
local residents and why why aren't there
 
04:06:43.670 --> 04:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
more food trucks where are the food
 
04:06:46.389 --> 04:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
trucks um people really want them but
 
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
the problem is the those local licensing
 
04:06:51.429 --> 04:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh problems and
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
they are different so you would have to
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's not just the fee
 
04:06:57.429 --> 04:06:57.439 align:start position:0%
you would have to pass a different
 
04:06:58.950 --> 04:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
license requirement in portsmouth than
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
you would in manchester that you
 
04:07:01.830 --> 04:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't conquer then you would in keene
 
04:07:04.389 --> 04:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
and it's very difficult and discouraging
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
and so this statewide license would
 
04:07:08.630 --> 04:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
really free these food trucks to operate
 
04:07:10.389 --> 04:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
statewide we think it would be a great
 
04:07:12.070 --> 04:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
great thing for new hampshire
 
04:07:14.469 --> 04:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions yep are you
 
04:07:14.479 --> 04:07:15.990 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions yep are you
saying

04:07:15.990 --> 04:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
saying
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
if you're in one of these cities
 
04:07:20.710 --> 04:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
and they have the capability of
 
04:07:22.229 --> 04:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
inspecting them you still have to get
 
04:07:24.389 --> 04:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
their license right are you thinking the
 
04:07:27.349 --> 04:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
state license is all they need to get
 
04:07:30.630 --> 04:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
as i read the bill um currently and you
 
04:07:32.950 --> 04:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
heard the sponsor say inspection is in
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
the bill for at the state level they
 
04:07:37.910 --> 04:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment that the sponsor
 
04:07:39.269 --> 04:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned before that would take
 
04:07:41.910 --> 04:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
inspection out that would i assume if
 
04:07:43.510 --> 04:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
that amendment passes it would allow the
 
04:07:45.990 --> 04:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
locals to still inspect
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
i i think not having read the amendment
 
04:07:50.389 --> 04:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
but i think that's potentially a problem
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
again you
 
04:07:54.309 --> 04:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
ideally you want one inspection
 
04:07:55.990 --> 04:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
at the state level you don't want the
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
food truck to have to get inspected in
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
three or four or five different
 
04:08:00.870 --> 04:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities um because again you're
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
you're raising the burden so ideally
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
you'd have it just in one place and to
 
04:08:07.030 --> 04:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
answer terry's question
 
04:08:09.030 --> 04:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
starting in 2016
 
04:08:11.110 --> 04:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
utah became the first state
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge to to do a statewide
 
04:08:15.990 --> 04:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
food truck license that was followed by
 
04:08:16.000 --> 04:08:17.189 align:start position:0%
food truck license that was followed by
arizona

04:08:17.189 --> 04:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
arizona
 
04:08:20.229 --> 04:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
i'm in 2017 or 18 and then in 2018 rhode
 
04:08:22.149 --> 04:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
island did one
 
04:08:22.159 --> 04:08:22.950 align:start position:0%
island did one
and

04:08:22.950 --> 04:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:08:24.389 --> 04:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
for all the same reasons if you go back
 
04:08:26.229 --> 04:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
and read those stories they had food
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
trucks that had just massive problems
 
04:08:29.269 --> 04:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
getting licensed in all the different
 
04:08:30.830 --> 04:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities and
 
04:08:33.110 --> 04:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
um i mean the sponsor for the rhode
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
island bill has become pretty popular in
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
newport because
 
04:08:39.510 --> 04:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
he freed the food trucks in newport so
 
04:08:42.070 --> 04:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
um washington state also has a statewide
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
licensing for food trucks but i'm not
 
04:08:45.429 --> 04:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
sure i don't know the details of that
 
04:08:48.149 --> 04:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
bill and how similar it is to this one
 
04:08:50.550 --> 04:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
so there aren't many states but
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
it has been something that's been coming
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
up in the last few years because of the
 
04:08:56.149 --> 04:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
popularity of food trucks
 
04:08:57.830 --> 04:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:09:01.590 --> 04:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
so with this amendment
 
04:09:04.070 --> 04:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
um correct me if i'm wrong the amendment
 
04:09:04.080 --> 04:09:06.229 align:start position:0%
um correct me if i'm wrong the amendment
would

04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:09:07.590 --> 04:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
not allow
 
04:09:09.910 --> 04:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
the municipality whatever the wherever
 
04:09:09.920 --> 04:09:10.550 align:start position:0%
the municipality whatever the wherever
the

04:09:10.550 --> 04:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:09:12.550 --> 04:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
municipality is located
 
04:09:15.030 --> 04:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to inspect
 
04:09:16.950 --> 04:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
say there's a problem on a food truck i
 
04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
i haven't read the amendment as i
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
read the bill the bill as written would
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
take the state the inspections at the
 
04:09:25.590 --> 04:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
state level and that
 
04:09:27.830 --> 04:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i think i think what the amendment
 
04:09:30.070 --> 04:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
would do is allow municipalities to also
 
04:09:31.510 --> 04:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
inspect but then they wouldn't get
 
04:09:33.590 --> 04:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
compensated i don't know
 
04:09:34.870 --> 04:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
i can't answer that i don't know the
 
04:09:37.429 --> 04:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
answer to that thank you um
 
04:09:39.110 --> 04:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative billio
 
04:09:40.950 --> 04:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you mr chair thank you for
 
04:09:43.670 --> 04:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
taking the question um
 
04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
in in doing a lot of research on food
 
04:09:48.790 --> 04:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
trucks have you talked to town planners
 
04:09:50.710 --> 04:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
planning departments yep
 
04:09:53.349 --> 04:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
and um i i
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
is there a problem
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
do you think that
 
04:09:59.990 --> 04:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
would you believe that i
 
04:10:03.110 --> 04:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
town planners or the planning department
 
04:10:03.120 --> 04:10:04.070 align:start position:0%
town planners or the planning department
have

04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:10:07.110 --> 04:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
they are responsible for allowing these
 
04:10:09.590 --> 04:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
food trucks to be in a certain area so
 
04:10:11.189 --> 04:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
would you believe that i think we should
 
04:10:11.199 --> 04:10:11.910 align:start position:0%
would you believe that i think we should
be

04:10:11.910 --> 04:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:10:14.710 --> 04:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
working with the town planners or the
 
04:10:16.790 --> 04:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
city planners to
 
04:10:16.800 --> 04:10:18.070 align:start position:0%
city planners to
adjust

04:10:18.070 --> 04:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
adjust
 
04:10:19.830 --> 04:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
this food truck um
 
04:10:22.149 --> 04:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
you know sure i'm happy to address that
 
04:10:24.630 --> 04:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
so the bill as written would not
 
04:10:26.710 --> 04:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
interfere in any way in the town's
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
ability to regulate the locations of
 
04:10:32.309 --> 04:10:32.319 align:start position:0%
food trucks so that that means
 
04:10:34.550 --> 04:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
they can still tell through the zoning
 
04:10:36.389 --> 04:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
planning ordinances they can regulate
 
04:10:36.399 --> 04:10:37.189 align:start position:0%
planning ordinances they can regulate
where

04:10:37.189 --> 04:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
and when and how many food trucks are in
 
04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
town all that stuff remains a local
 
04:10:44.550 --> 04:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
um priority and this bill doesn't change
 
04:10:45.990 --> 04:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
that so
 
04:10:47.590 --> 04:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
so would you believe that that is a big
 
04:10:49.189 --> 04:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
hurdle oh no it is one of the big
 
04:10:51.030 --> 04:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
reasons why there aren't food trucks in
 
04:10:52.950 --> 04:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
manchester oh no that's that's exactly
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
right i wasn't going to get into that
 
04:10:55.429 --> 04:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
issue because that's not really part of
 
04:10:56.630 --> 04:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
the spill but
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's a whole food it's a different issue
 
04:11:00.870 --> 04:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
but um zoning regulations of where food
 
04:11:03.349 --> 04:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
trucks so in manchester particular and
 
04:11:06.630 --> 04:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
portsmouth the zoning are are two of the
 
04:11:07.830 --> 04:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
major reasons why you don't have more
 
04:11:10.229 --> 04:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
food trucks but that's not
 
04:11:12.149 --> 04:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
directly related to this bill
 
04:11:14.790 --> 04:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
so make sure you get this right so
 
04:11:16.870 --> 04:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
the intent of this legislation is that
 
04:11:18.550 --> 04:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
there would be one-stop shopping for a
 
04:11:21.670 --> 04:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
license yes and that the cities and
 
04:11:25.990 --> 04:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:27.910 --> 04:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
require a license but
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be allowed to
 
04:11:31.030 --> 04:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
charge for one
 
04:11:31.040 --> 04:11:31.830 align:start position:0%
charge for one
as

04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:11:34.469 --> 04:11:34.479 align:start position:0%
i read it and i can if you bear with me
 
04:11:36.149 --> 04:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
here the amendment looks the amendment
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
looks like to me that that it says not
 
04:11:40.630 --> 04:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
required it's kind of confusing because
 
04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
it says
 
04:11:44.309 --> 04:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
to to offer a license
 
04:11:44.319 --> 04:11:45.670 align:start position:0%
to to offer a license
uh

04:11:45.670 --> 04:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:11:47.750 --> 04:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
it says abyssal shall not require a
 
04:11:50.229 --> 04:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
separate license or permit to operate a
 
04:11:51.510 --> 04:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
food truck whether they miss valley
 
04:11:53.590 --> 04:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
unless you already have a license so if
 
04:11:55.910 --> 04:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
you don't have a separate the town can't
 
04:11:57.269 --> 04:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
issue a license
 
04:11:58.630 --> 04:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
but you're saying it's okay they can
 
04:11:58.640 --> 04:12:00.070 align:start position:0%
but you're saying it's okay they can
expect

04:12:00.070 --> 04:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
expect
 
04:12:00.080 --> 04:12:01.670 align:start position:0%
expect
but

04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:12:03.750 --> 04:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh john hunt's rule of licensure is the
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
reason we have licensure is so we can
 
04:12:08.229 --> 04:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
take it away from you right so no town
 
04:12:09.750 --> 04:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be happy
 
04:12:13.429 --> 04:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
if we say well you you can go in
 
04:12:16.229 --> 04:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
and inspect but you don't ha you don't
 
04:12:17.830 --> 04:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
have any control over the license the
 
04:12:20.309 --> 04:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
state does correct that's how so i just
 
04:12:21.910 --> 04:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
got this for the first time right just
 
04:12:23.429 --> 04:12:23.439 align:start position:0%
reading it now so i'm a little worried
 
04:12:25.990 --> 04:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
that this amendment is problematic but
 
04:12:27.590 --> 04:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
let's understand let's just agree with
 
04:12:29.990 --> 04:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
what we want to agree on so we're hoping
 
04:12:33.189 --> 04:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
is is the state could have be able to
 
04:12:35.750 --> 04:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
issue a license
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
one-stop shopping right
 
04:12:41.189 --> 04:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
and uh and and i guess
 
04:12:43.510 --> 04:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
if if it gets down to that this only can
 
04:12:43.520 --> 04:12:44.630 align:start position:0%
if if it gets down to that this only can
be

04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:12:46.710 --> 04:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
everywhere except in these towns that
 
04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
have decided to have their own license
 
04:12:50.790 --> 04:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
right so that's the way it works now
 
04:12:53.110 --> 04:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
right is you you can't go into those
 
04:12:54.870 --> 04:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
towns without getting their license so
 
04:12:56.870 --> 04:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
ideally what you would have is a
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
situation where you get a food truck
 
04:13:00.229 --> 04:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
license from the state
 
04:13:02.309 --> 04:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
and then your only
 
04:13:02.319 --> 04:13:04.469 align:start position:0%
and then your only
um

04:13:04.469 --> 04:13:04.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:06.630 --> 04:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
legal process with the local town is to
 
04:13:06.640 --> 04:13:07.830 align:start position:0%
legal process with the local town is to
register

04:13:07.830 --> 04:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
register
 
04:13:10.149 --> 04:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
and not to apply for a new license and
 
04:13:11.910 --> 04:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
inspection and that i think is what this
 
04:13:14.229 --> 04:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
bill tries to do is make sure that you
 
04:13:16.070 --> 04:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
you can register with the municipalities
 
04:13:17.349 --> 04:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
so you're on their books they know who
 
04:13:18.710 --> 04:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
you are they have your license plate
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
number all that sort of stuff but
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
they're not inspected just took their
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
revenue away yes
 
04:13:26.229 --> 04:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
for them to be able to go out and do
 
04:13:28.550 --> 04:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
that inspection well right and then the
 
04:13:30.229 --> 04:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
original bill they're not allowed to
 
04:13:32.149 --> 04:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
inspect in the original bill
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's it the inspection happens well the
 
04:13:35.510 --> 04:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
original was put
 
04:13:37.189 --> 04:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
their inspection was not necessary
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
because right the licensure body is the
 
04:13:42.389 --> 04:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
state right which i think would
 
04:13:44.149 --> 04:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
just from my own personal point of view
 
04:13:46.389 --> 04:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
that would be preferable as a one-stop
 
04:13:49.110 --> 04:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
shop i say this one's the best
 
04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
but ideally however you work out the
 
04:13:52.870 --> 04:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
details i think the point is you want
 
04:13:52.880 --> 04:13:58.469 align:start position:0%
details i think the point is you want
that

04:13:58.469 --> 04:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:00.550 --> 04:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you so i just want to be uh clear
 
04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
in summarizing what i believe that i've
 
04:14:03.590 --> 04:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
been hearing today
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
that um the intent of the bill
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
is to eliminate redundancy
 
04:14:12.710 --> 04:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
such that
 
04:14:14.469 --> 04:14:14.479 align:start position:0%
in today's
 
04:14:14.479 --> 04:14:15.910 align:start position:0%
in today's
environment

04:14:15.910 --> 04:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
environment
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
if a food truck wanted to operate in all
 
04:14:21.429 --> 04:14:21.439 align:start position:0%
15 cities as well as the state right
 
04:14:24.149 --> 04:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
that that that that would involve 16
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
different inspections correct at the
 
04:14:29.189 --> 04:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
cost of hundreds upon hundreds of
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
dollars correct yes yes
 
04:14:34.309 --> 04:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
so if we want to make if we want to make
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
it easier for entrepreneurs
 
04:14:38.870 --> 04:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
right to operate food trucks
 
04:14:41.349 --> 04:14:41.359 align:start position:0%
offer that service in the state
 
04:14:43.750 --> 04:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
and we want to make it easier for
 
04:14:43.760 --> 04:14:45.429 align:start position:0%
and we want to make it easier for
consumers

04:14:45.429 --> 04:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
who would like to patronize a food truck
 
04:14:51.660 --> 04:14:51.670 align:start position:0%
in manchester that they patronized in
 
04:14:51.670 --> 04:14:54.550 align:start position:0%
in manchester that they patronized in
[Music]

04:14:54.550 --> 04:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:14:57.269 --> 04:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
dixville notch
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
they'd have an easier time to do that
 
04:15:02.950 --> 04:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
because the cost on the provider of
 
04:15:04.389 --> 04:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
operating in that truck would be
 
04:15:06.870 --> 04:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced because we'd be
 
04:15:09.510 --> 04:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
eliminating the redundancies of the same
 
04:15:11.349 --> 04:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
types and they might not even be the
 
04:15:12.870 --> 04:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
exact same
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
inspections because the currently the
 
04:15:18.389 --> 04:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
rules in the cities as to what
 
04:15:20.790 --> 04:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
constitutes an inspection would are
 
04:15:20.800 --> 04:15:21.990 align:start position:0%
constitutes an inspection would are
different

04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:15:24.870 --> 04:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
than the statewide and differ from city
 
04:15:26.790 --> 04:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
to city correct which would absolutely
 
04:15:26.800 --> 04:15:27.750 align:start position:0%
to city correct which would absolutely
be

04:15:27.750 --> 04:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:15:30.630 --> 04:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
a disincentive to somebody to be able to
 
04:15:33.510 --> 04:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
operate throughout the entire state
 
04:15:34.950 --> 04:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
in addition to the fact that they would
 
04:15:36.630 --> 04:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
be driven out of their mind as well as
 
04:15:38.630 --> 04:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
bankrupted thank you right and i think
 
04:15:40.229 --> 04:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
again the point is
 
04:15:41.349 --> 04:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
so i think you have to think of what's
 
04:15:43.189 --> 04:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
the point of inspection
 
04:15:44.790 --> 04:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
i mean that's that's the real question
 
04:15:46.870 --> 04:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
right it's it's public health and safety
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
right so if the state is
 
04:15:51.189 --> 04:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
taking over that portion of the
 
04:15:53.590 --> 04:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
licensing inspection the state is saying
 
04:15:56.389 --> 04:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
04:15:58.469 --> 04:15:58.479 align:start position:0%
we are inspecting these and we are
 
04:16:00.070 --> 04:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
issuing them a license and we're
 
04:16:01.429 --> 04:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
verifying that they meet all the
 
04:16:02.469 --> 04:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
requirements for public health and
 
04:16:02.479 --> 04:16:03.429 align:start position:0%
requirements for public health and
safety

04:16:03.429 --> 04:16:03.439 align:start position:0%
safety
 
04:16:04.950 --> 04:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
then what's the point of getting an
 
04:16:07.349 --> 04:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
additional local inspection
 
04:16:09.189 --> 04:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
that you don't want to
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know why you would add the local
 
04:16:12.469 --> 04:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
inspection on top of it if the state is
 
04:16:14.070 --> 04:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
doing the inspection and saying yes i
 
04:16:16.229 --> 04:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
mean i understand why municipalities
 
04:16:18.550 --> 04:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
are reluctant to give up you know
 
04:16:21.110 --> 04:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
inspection authority but again if the
 
04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
goal is simply to ensure for the public
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
that if you see a food truck and has a
 
04:16:26.550 --> 04:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire license and a permit on
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
there it has been state inspected for
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
health and safety you don't need the
 
04:16:32.710 --> 04:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
redundancy of local inspections on top
 
04:16:35.269 --> 04:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:37.590 --> 04:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay represent immaculate real quickly
 
04:16:37.600 --> 04:16:38.469 align:start position:0%
okay represent immaculate real quickly
um

04:16:38.469 --> 04:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:41.110 --> 04:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
if the state is doing the issuing of the
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
license does that preclude a
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
municipality of charging a vendor's
 
04:16:48.469 --> 04:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
license wouldn't they still have that
 
04:16:50.710 --> 04:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity i think they would as i read
 
04:16:51.750 --> 04:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
the last line of the bill is that
 
04:16:55.750 --> 04:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
nothing shall prevent the municipality
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
from enforcing local land use regulation
 
04:16:59.590 --> 04:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
zoning and other ordinances in relation
 
04:17:01.750 --> 04:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
to the operation of a food truck within
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
its borders so i think you could have
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of
 
04:17:06.710 --> 04:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
obviously you'd have to register that
 
04:17:08.309 --> 04:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
town and you could probably have some
 
04:17:10.630 --> 04:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
sort of vendor registration that kind of
 
04:17:10.640 --> 04:17:14.389 align:start position:0%
sort of vendor registration that kind of
thing

04:17:14.389 --> 04:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:18.479 --> 04:17:20.710 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:17:20.710 --> 04:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:17:27.910 --> 04:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:29.429 --> 04:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
04:17:31.110 --> 04:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee for holding this hearing today
 
04:17:32.710 --> 04:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
just for the record my name is ross
 
04:17:34.630 --> 04:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
connolly i'm the deputy state director
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
for americans for prosperity here in new
 
04:17:38.710 --> 04:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh here to voice our support
 
04:17:43.510 --> 04:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
for hb5 uh 1595. uh
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
i think that we've been discussing this
 
04:17:47.349 --> 04:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
quite a bit it can be a complicated
 
04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
issue but the crux of the matter is that
 
04:17:51.750 --> 04:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
the the current process is incredibly
 
04:17:54.550 --> 04:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and difficult for
 
04:17:56.469 --> 04:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
anyone who wants to open and operate a
 
04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
food truck in the state of new hampshire
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
as representative terry pointed out you
 
04:18:03.030 --> 04:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
would need 16 different licenses
 
04:18:06.070 --> 04:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
16 different sets of rules across the
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
state if you if
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
you you'd like to operate a truck across
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire uh those 15
 
04:18:15.670 --> 04:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities that do self-inspection
 
04:18:17.830 --> 04:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh they they happen to be the the
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
largest uh municipalities in the state
 
04:18:22.389 --> 04:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
that's where food trucks would want to
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
operate as the the previous speaker from
 
04:18:26.149 --> 04:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
services mentioned
 
04:18:31.750 --> 04:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh there's 200 total to around 200 total
 
04:18:35.110 --> 04:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
food trucks operating in the state 174
 
04:18:37.030 --> 04:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
of those are in those self-inspecting
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
towns so the real issue is the conflict
 
04:18:43.830 --> 04:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
between those 15 towns and the
 
04:18:46.630 --> 04:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
differences between those and for an
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
individual business owner just trying to
 
04:18:51.269 --> 04:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
make a buck and grow their business they
 
04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
have to navigate through
 
04:18:56.790 --> 04:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
15 16 different sets of rules that it's
 
04:19:00.070 --> 04:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
very confusing it's it's hard for them
 
04:19:02.550 --> 04:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
to do and some towns are more onerous
 
04:19:04.550 --> 04:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
than others i live in the town of
 
04:19:04.560 --> 04:19:06.149 align:start position:0%
than others i live in the town of
merrimack

04:19:06.149 --> 04:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
merrimack
 
04:19:08.070 --> 04:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's a business in town called abel
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
ebenezer uh they're a brewery that does
 
04:19:13.110 --> 04:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
not do food so they have food trucks
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
come to their their location and
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's difficult to get food
 
04:19:19.590 --> 04:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
trucks into the town of merrimack
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
because the process is very cumbersome
 
04:19:22.560 --> 04:19:24.229 align:start position:0%
because the process is very cumbersome
um

04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:26.950 --> 04:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons we think the the
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
original intent of the bill i i do have
 
04:19:31.269 --> 04:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment i i can't uh i haven't
 
04:19:32.790 --> 04:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
looked at it that closely so i can't
 
04:19:34.870 --> 04:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
comment on that but what we'd really
 
04:19:36.870 --> 04:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
like to see is just a more streamlined
 
04:19:39.189 --> 04:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
process for these business owners to
 
04:19:40.870 --> 04:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
operate in new hampshire and and we
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
think the original bill uh definitely
 
04:19:45.110 --> 04:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
accomplishes that so i'd be happy to
 
04:19:46.870 --> 04:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
04:19:49.110 --> 04:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
representing billio uh yes thank you mr
 
04:19:50.790 --> 04:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:19:52.950 --> 04:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
um could you talk a little bit about
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
local control
 
04:19:56.950 --> 04:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for the question
 
04:19:59.189 --> 04:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative regards to this bill i i
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
think local control in some areas is a
 
04:20:03.990 --> 04:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
good idea this is not one of those areas
 
04:20:06.790 --> 04:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
in in my opinion uh
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
just because again it's so confusing
 
04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
for people to go from town to town and
 
04:20:14.950 --> 04:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
and and try to understand the
 
04:20:17.110 --> 04:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
differences of the rules i think a more
 
04:20:20.309 --> 04:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
streamlined state wide process obviously
 
04:20:23.349 --> 04:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
as as uh the previous speaker mentioned
 
04:20:23.359 --> 04:20:24.149 align:start position:0%
as as uh the previous speaker mentioned
uh

04:20:24.149 --> 04:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:20:26.070 --> 04:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
the town would still have a great say
 
04:20:28.229 --> 04:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
over where these these trucks are
 
04:20:31.110 --> 04:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
operating uh they would have a say over
 
04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
over things like local registrations
 
04:20:36.469 --> 04:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
hawkers and peddlers uh local licenses
 
04:20:38.630 --> 04:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
things like that it's just
 
04:20:41.030 --> 04:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of the rules for operating a
 
04:20:43.510 --> 04:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
food truck in particular there should be
 
04:20:47.030 --> 04:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
a single rule at the state level so that
 
04:20:48.790 --> 04:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh these business owners can operate
 
04:20:50.229 --> 04:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
more easily
 
04:20:52.309 --> 04:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
and just a follow-up about
 
04:20:56.149 --> 04:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities if all of these cities um
 
04:20:58.630 --> 04:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities do not agree with this
 
04:21:00.870 --> 04:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
bill do not like this bill and they're
 
04:21:02.710 --> 04:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
you know it's all about local control i
 
04:21:03.990 --> 04:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
mean how
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
how how can you get past that
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:21:11.830 --> 04:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative i i again i i just go
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
back to
 
04:21:15.269 --> 04:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
what what we'd like to see is to make
 
04:21:17.349 --> 04:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
this a simpler process for the business
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
owners that's our biggest concern is is
 
04:21:21.910 --> 04:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
there are people that are operating in
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
the state now that are struggling to do
 
04:21:26.870 --> 04:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
it and contribute to communities these
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
food trucks
 
04:21:30.710 --> 04:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
operate across the country uh
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
in in are extremely popular for younger
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
generations if you go to any city across
 
04:21:36.630 --> 04:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
the country
 
04:21:39.189 --> 04:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
most of them have a a line of food
 
04:21:42.550 --> 04:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
trucks uh in business centers and and
 
04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
live work play areas
 
04:21:47.269 --> 04:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh we i'd like to see that the same for
 
04:21:49.349 --> 04:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and and we
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill would make that
 
04:21:52.790 --> 04:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
that easier and bring that commerce to
 
04:21:57.189 --> 04:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:59.429 --> 04:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
representative terry
 
04:22:02.149 --> 04:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
yeah with respect to the uh
 
04:22:03.429 --> 04:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
the concern or the issue raised about
 
04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
local control
 
04:22:09.990 --> 04:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
i want to be careful about how i
 
04:22:12.870 --> 04:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
phrased this uh
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
do you do you do you see any difference
 
04:22:15.359 --> 04:22:17.189 align:start position:0%
do you do you do you see any difference
between

04:22:17.189 --> 04:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:22:19.349 --> 04:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate health standards for food
 
04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
trucks in alton compared to manchester
 
04:22:24.149 --> 04:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
04:22:27.670 --> 04:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
no that
 
04:22:27.680 --> 04:22:28.630 align:start position:0%
no that
again

04:22:28.630 --> 04:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:22:30.550 --> 04:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
the food standard should be applied
 
04:22:31.990 --> 04:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
equally across the state of new
 
04:22:32.000 --> 04:22:33.830 align:start position:0%
equally across the state of new
hampshire

04:22:33.830 --> 04:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:22:37.269 --> 04:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
you know that aspect of of uh you know
 
04:22:39.670 --> 04:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
local differences and regulations makes
 
04:22:42.870 --> 04:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
it very very confusing and and uh we
 
04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
streamlining that making that more clear
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh i think helps the business owners to
 
04:22:50.710 --> 04:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
actually grow their business
 
04:22:52.710 --> 04:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
if there's different role from alton to
 
04:22:54.710 --> 04:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
meredith to moultonborough
 
04:22:54.720 --> 04:22:55.590 align:start position:0%
meredith to moultonborough
uh

04:22:55.590 --> 04:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:22:57.030 --> 04:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's just around lake
 
04:22:59.349 --> 04:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee that would be extremely
 
04:22:59.359 --> 04:23:00.389 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee that would be extremely
confusing

04:23:00.389 --> 04:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
04:23:02.070 --> 04:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
if you're moving around
 
04:23:04.630 --> 04:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
lake winnipesaukee let alone the 15
 
04:23:04.640 --> 04:23:05.670 align:start position:0%
lake winnipesaukee let alone the 15
largest

04:23:05.670 --> 04:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
largest
 
04:23:07.750 --> 04:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state that do have
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:18.149 --> 04:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:18.159 --> 04:23:18.760 align:start position:0%

04:23:18.760 --> 04:23:18.770 align:start position:0%

04:23:18.770 --> 04:23:21.269 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:23:21.269 --> 04:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:23:23.510 --> 04:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
just a couple observations
 
04:23:24.790 --> 04:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
about one
 
04:23:27.670 --> 04:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
if you if uh would you believe
 
04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
that the cities those 15 cities
 
04:23:33.990 --> 04:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
might have an interest in exactly where
 
04:23:36.229 --> 04:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
those locations can be
 
04:23:38.309 --> 04:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
so in other words if there is a
 
04:23:38.319 --> 04:23:39.830 align:start position:0%
so in other words if there is a
restriction

04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
you're not against restricting zoning
 
04:23:45.990 --> 04:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
laws or anything like that so that
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
you the cities have the up i still have
 
04:23:51.510 --> 04:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
determining where the food trucks can be
 
04:23:55.269 --> 04:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:23:56.870 --> 04:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative yes
 
04:23:59.990 --> 04:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
as i read the original bill the cities
 
04:24:02.229 --> 04:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
towns would still have that control that
 
04:24:04.469 --> 04:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate uh
 
04:24:06.630 --> 04:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise you could have them you know
 
04:24:07.830 --> 04:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
in residential neighborhoods or
 
04:24:09.429 --> 04:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
something obviously people wouldn't
 
04:24:11.830 --> 04:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't care for that uh so they would
 
04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
the planning boards in in local towns or
 
04:24:16.790 --> 04:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
cities would still have that that
 
04:24:20.149 --> 04:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
oversight over where they can operate uh
 
04:24:22.469 --> 04:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
and as has been mentioned registering
 
04:24:24.790 --> 04:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
them so we we know who is operating in
 
04:24:27.750 --> 04:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
each locality uh just in terms of the
 
04:24:30.469 --> 04:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
most cumbersome onerous uh levels of
 
04:24:34.070 --> 04:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
regulation that that should be a a more
 
04:24:36.389 --> 04:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
streamlined process but as it turns it
 
04:24:38.790 --> 04:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
comes to you know operating within it
 
04:24:42.309 --> 04:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
within a locality uh the those those
 
04:24:45.110 --> 04:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities will will still have the
 
04:24:46.950 --> 04:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
ability to to tell them where they can
 
04:24:49.110 --> 04:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
operate where they cannot question of
 
04:24:51.510 --> 04:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
the chair have we determined whether or
 
04:24:54.389 --> 04:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
not the municipalities the 15
 
04:24:57.429 --> 04:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities will still have the legal
 
04:24:59.110 --> 04:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
right to charge
 
04:25:01.110 --> 04:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
a fee for
 
04:25:04.469 --> 04:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
being doing business in our towns
 
04:25:06.870 --> 04:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
at this point the intent of the bill is
 
04:25:06.880 --> 04:25:07.670 align:start position:0%
at this point the intent of the bill is
no

04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:25:09.510 --> 04:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is that you have
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
one registration with the state
 
04:25:12.000 --> 04:25:13.349 align:start position:0%
one registration with the state
now

04:25:13.349 --> 04:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:25:15.189 --> 04:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
it does beg the question if then you go
 
04:25:18.070 --> 04:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
to a town and they also say well okay so
 
04:25:19.349 --> 04:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get you for that
 
04:25:21.110 --> 04:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
license but you still got to do the
 
04:25:24.309 --> 04:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
hawkers and peddler's license
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
so you really so the problem really is
 
04:25:29.510 --> 04:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
how much have you really solved
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
if every town you go to you still have
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
to get the hacker and peddler's license
 
04:25:33.600 --> 04:25:35.269 align:start position:0%
to get the hacker and peddler's license
anyways

04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
let alone the fact that you have the
 
04:25:37.990 --> 04:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
state license
 
04:25:40.630 --> 04:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
i guess the savings is that you
 
04:25:42.229 --> 04:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
won't have to get
 
04:25:43.750 --> 04:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
two licenses
 
04:25:45.590 --> 04:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
when you go to manchester or go to these
 
04:25:47.510 --> 04:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
cities or three you only have to get one
 
04:25:50.710 --> 04:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
so that's what you streamline but um
 
04:25:53.590 --> 04:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i i would encourage uh
 
04:25:55.110 --> 04:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
the members to maybe reach out to the
 
04:25:57.429 --> 04:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office they handle
 
04:25:59.030 --> 04:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
the statewide hawkers and peddler's
 
04:26:01.429 --> 04:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
license i personally don't know if the
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
local license is no it does that bill
 
04:26:04.870 --> 04:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
came through this committee and i
 
04:26:06.309 --> 04:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
remember this issue
 
04:26:06.319 --> 04:26:07.590 align:start position:0%
remember this issue
intimately

04:26:07.590 --> 04:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
intimately
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess my right this is a bill
 
04:26:12.229 --> 04:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
that looks like it sounds great on paper
 
04:26:14.309 --> 04:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
but boy it's it's going to be problem
 
04:26:16.630 --> 04:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
imply you know doing implementing it
 
04:26:17.990 --> 04:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
mainly because
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
i think the zoning you talk about the
 
04:26:22.229 --> 04:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
zoning location in my experience
 
04:26:25.189 --> 04:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
yes in college towns the college
 
04:26:25.199 --> 04:26:26.229 align:start position:0%
yes in college towns the college
literally

04:26:26.229 --> 04:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
literally
 
04:26:28.309 --> 04:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
the town has figured out a street that
 
04:26:30.070 --> 04:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
they want them all lined up and they're
 
04:26:30.080 --> 04:26:30.950 align:start position:0%
they want them all lined up and they're
all

04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:26:32.469 --> 04:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
you know like you say this
 
04:26:34.389 --> 04:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
there's a parking lot you know parking
 
04:26:35.830 --> 04:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
for them and that
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
and uh because the zoning of them is
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
limited and because they also need
 
04:26:42.550 --> 04:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
electricity and water a lot of times and
 
04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
so there and that that's goes back to
 
04:26:46.389 --> 04:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
the landlord and how many leases that
 
04:26:48.389 --> 04:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
you have so the idea that anyone is
 
04:26:50.389 --> 04:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
going to want to get a license in all 16
 
04:26:50.399 --> 04:26:51.750 align:start position:0%
going to want to get a license in all 16
towns

04:26:51.750 --> 04:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
towns
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
i just don't i just can't imagine that
 
04:26:55.030 --> 04:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
ever happening because that you would
 
04:26:56.710 --> 04:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
spend more time going around negotiating
 
04:26:58.469 --> 04:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
leases and doing all that stuff
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
so i i understand the intent is to try
 
04:27:02.389 --> 04:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
to streamline this and how do we make it
 
04:27:04.070 --> 04:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
simpler and easier
 
04:27:05.910 --> 04:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
and and that's the charge for this
 
04:27:10.149 --> 04:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:12.710 --> 04:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
represented him yes thank you
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
um would you believe um
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
i have some concerns about the local
 
04:27:21.269 --> 04:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
control issue
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
the perception of the town
 
04:27:23.760 --> 04:27:24.710 align:start position:0%
the perception of the town
that

04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:27.910 --> 04:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:30.550 --> 04:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
or economic opportunity or whatever
 
04:27:32.229 --> 04:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
is being
 
04:27:35.189 --> 04:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
controlled or dictated by the state
 
04:27:37.830 --> 04:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
leaving the municipality with
 
04:27:41.429 --> 04:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
maybe just the hours of operation or
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
parking or a few other details
 
04:27:46.870 --> 04:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
i think it sounds like a good idea but
 
04:27:48.149 --> 04:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
04:27:50.469 --> 04:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
i would be sensitive
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
to the impression
 
04:27:55.030 --> 04:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
that we're giving to the towns that
 
04:27:57.349 --> 04:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
were taking over
 
04:28:00.309 --> 04:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh regulating this industry
 
04:28:03.269 --> 04:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
and perhaps getting a little pushback
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
04:28:06.550 --> 04:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
i i
 
04:28:08.389 --> 04:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
understand that concern representative
 
04:28:11.189 --> 04:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh but the state does many things from
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
it from a state level in terms of
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
registration and licensing and and we
 
04:28:19.189 --> 04:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
view this as an appropriate change
 
04:28:21.910 --> 04:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
to again you're still working with the
 
04:28:25.269 --> 04:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
localities on location
 
04:28:27.750 --> 04:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
possibly on on the hawkers and peddler's
 
04:28:30.870 --> 04:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
license they still have a large say over
 
04:28:33.110 --> 04:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
over what's happening i view this as a
 
04:28:35.429 --> 04:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
collaboration between local and state
 
04:28:35.439 --> 04:28:36.389 align:start position:0%
collaboration between local and state
government

04:28:36.389 --> 04:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:28:38.630 --> 04:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
and this this would uh
 
04:28:40.389 --> 04:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
you know just just something that would
 
04:28:42.870 --> 04:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
really really help these small business
 
04:28:46.389 --> 04:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
owners to help grow their business
 
04:28:48.630 --> 04:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you uh
 
04:28:51.030 --> 04:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
having no more cards
 
04:28:51.040 --> 04:28:51.990 align:start position:0%
having no more cards
uh

04:28:51.990 --> 04:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
nothing on the blue sheet here and the
 
04:28:57.750 --> 04:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
sign in the overnight sign in we had
 
04:29:00.870 --> 04:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
nine people in support and three opposed
 
04:29:02.950 --> 04:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
and with that i will close the public
 
04:29:05.830 --> 04:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
hearing and yes this will go to a
 
04:29:05.840 --> 04:29:14.950 align:start position:0%
hearing and yes this will go to a
subcommittee

04:29:14.950 --> 04:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:18.149 --> 04:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on
 
04:32:23.110 --> 04:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
1095 and hear from the prime spencer
 
04:32:25.110 --> 04:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative wolf good afternoon
 
04:32:26.550 --> 04:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative wolf i'm sorry you were
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
delayed but i'm sure you wanted to hear
 
04:32:34.070 --> 04:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
all about the regulatory authority over
 
04:32:36.550 --> 04:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
these wonderful delivery of food to our
 
04:32:36.560 --> 04:32:37.990 align:start position:0%
these wonderful delivery of food to our
community

04:32:37.990 --> 04:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:32:40.870 --> 04:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman members of the
 
04:32:42.149 --> 04:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
house commerce
 
04:32:44.469 --> 04:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
and consumer affairs committee i hope i
 
04:32:46.870 --> 04:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
won't take as long on this relatively
 
04:32:48.870 --> 04:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
simple bill of a hot dog
 
04:32:51.429 --> 04:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
with sauerkraut or chile
 
04:32:51.439 --> 04:32:52.229 align:start position:0%
with sauerkraut or chile
but

04:32:52.229 --> 04:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
i come before you today in support of hb
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
1095 a very simple piece of legislation
 
04:33:02.550 --> 04:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
for those 15 cities and towns and you've
 
04:33:04.470 --> 04:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about them that do not have
 
04:33:05.590 --> 04:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
their own
 
04:33:07.109 --> 04:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
health inspector that regulates
 
04:33:09.510 --> 04:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant there is no ability to have a
 
04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
push cart that provides fresh condiments
 
04:33:15.029 --> 04:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
other than in these 15 cities and towns
 
04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%
you cannot get
 
04:33:19.830 --> 04:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
sauerkraut or chili or fresh veggies on
 
04:33:21.269 --> 04:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
a hot dog
 
04:33:23.349 --> 04:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire does not have
 
04:33:25.670 --> 04:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
rules or regulations that provide for
 
04:33:27.109 --> 04:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
that ability
 
04:33:30.310 --> 04:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
the only mechanism as i understand it is
 
04:33:32.470 --> 04:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
for each vendor to get a specific
 
04:33:34.390 --> 04:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
variance from the department of health
 
04:33:36.390 --> 04:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
04:33:39.029 --> 04:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
the state health department inspects the
 
04:33:42.629 --> 04:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
push carts at least once once a year so
 
04:33:44.150 --> 04:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for a change in
 
04:33:46.629 --> 04:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
inspection or anything like that
 
04:33:49.109 --> 04:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
in my discussions with the department
 
04:33:51.750 --> 04:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
the process that they cited seemed to me
 
04:33:53.910 --> 04:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
to be overly difficult
 
04:33:56.310 --> 04:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
to obtain a variance items such as
 
04:33:59.109 --> 04:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
preparation in a certified kitchen
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i can go on appear overly regulated
 
04:34:05.429 --> 04:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
for example if the vendor buys pre-made
 
04:34:05.439 --> 04:34:06.470 align:start position:0%
for example if the vendor buys pre-made
chili

04:34:06.470 --> 04:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
chili
 
04:34:07.750 --> 04:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
brings it home
 
04:34:09.990 --> 04:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
and takes the intended daily supply to a
 
04:34:12.310 --> 04:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
push card keeping it at a serve safe
 
04:34:14.070 --> 04:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
temperature the whole time
 
04:34:17.189 --> 04:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
why is running water a three-based sink
 
04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
or a certified commercial kitchen
 
04:34:19.119 --> 04:34:20.789 align:start position:0%
or a certified commercial kitchen
necessary

04:34:20.789 --> 04:34:20.799 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
what i am asking for in this bill
 
04:34:25.750 --> 04:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
is the department of health and human
 
04:34:28.949 --> 04:34:28.959 align:start position:0%
establish rules and regulations and that
 
04:34:31.510 --> 04:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
such rules be reasonable
 
04:34:34.150 --> 04:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
a simple push cut vendor should not be
 
04:34:37.189 --> 04:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
limited in making a living and providing
 
04:34:39.510 --> 04:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
the public with a desired
 
04:34:43.269 --> 04:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
product such as condiments on a hot dog
 
04:34:45.750 --> 04:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'll be happy to answer any questions
 
04:34:47.910 --> 04:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
but it's a relatively simple bill you've
 
04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
heard about the other 15 towns
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
and we have a wonderful person right
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
here in concord that has caught
 
04:34:55.990 --> 04:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
as kraut
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
chili and actually uh
 
04:35:00.070 --> 04:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
even cheese whiz
 
04:35:02.310 --> 04:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
so is that in between the two streets
 
04:35:05.349 --> 04:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
there the little right oh yeah right on
 
04:35:05.359 --> 04:35:07.189 align:start position:0%
there the little right oh yeah right on
yeah

04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:35:07.199 --> 04:35:09.510 align:start position:0%
yeah
and

04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:11.429 --> 04:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
she does a great job
 
04:35:11.439 --> 04:35:13.269 align:start position:0%
she does a great job
so

04:35:13.269 --> 04:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
i i like my hot dog with
 
04:35:17.510 --> 04:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
onions on it
 
04:35:19.750 --> 04:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
you cannot get right now
 
04:35:22.390 --> 04:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
according to what i understand fresh
 
04:35:24.070 --> 04:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
vegetables and i don't know whether your
 
04:35:26.150 --> 04:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
onions are sauteed or not well i like
 
04:35:28.869 --> 04:35:28.879 align:start position:0%
them i like them raw raw yeah i like raw
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
i don't know you can't if i want if i
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
want the saute that would i wanted steak
 
04:35:35.429 --> 04:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
and cheese for that but
 
04:35:37.429 --> 04:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
i just want him raw on my hot dog
 
04:35:39.269 --> 04:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
no ketchup from pittsburgh worked in
 
04:35:40.869 --> 04:35:40.879 align:start position:0%
philadelphia for many years and got
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
steak and cheese
 
04:35:42.480 --> 04:35:43.429 align:start position:0%
steak and cheese
um

04:35:43.429 --> 04:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:45.269 --> 04:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding of the state
 
04:35:45.279 --> 04:35:46.310 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding of the state
department

04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:35:49.029 --> 04:35:49.039 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations that's crazy okay
 
04:35:53.990 --> 04:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:55.830 --> 04:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
04:35:58.070 --> 04:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
which is do you think it's problematic
 
04:35:59.990 --> 04:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
if somebody you mentioned i believe you
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
said making chili at home and then
 
04:36:03.269 --> 04:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
bringing it in
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
did you say that i did not say that i
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
said if they buy it pre-made okay if
 
04:36:10.629 --> 04:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
they buy it pre-made but i i think that
 
04:36:12.470 --> 04:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
that should be an option
 
04:36:14.789 --> 04:36:14.799 align:start position:0%
follow-up if they excuse me let me just
 
04:36:17.429 --> 04:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry if they do it at home
 
04:36:19.029 --> 04:36:19.039 align:start position:0%
and maybe they have to have their home
 
04:36:21.510 --> 04:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
inspected but a three-based sink at home
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
to make chili
 
04:36:26.070 --> 04:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
it's a little bizarre follow-up for the
 
04:36:27.830 --> 04:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
question question yeah i i think that
 
04:36:29.830 --> 04:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
might be problematic if it's not a
 
04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
certified safe served kitchen i mean
 
04:36:34.629 --> 04:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
that's the law for um caters and just
 
04:36:36.470 --> 04:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
follow up this is just in the in the
 
04:36:38.310 --> 04:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
category of stupid
 
04:36:40.949 --> 04:36:40.959 align:start position:0%
minutia um it says frankfurters and
 
04:36:43.109 --> 04:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
pre-cooked sausages of frankfurter
 
04:36:45.750 --> 04:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
because i look this up is actually
 
04:36:47.349 --> 04:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
i mean if you talk about a hot dog a hot
 
04:36:49.590 --> 04:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
dog is not a sausage a frankfurter is
 
04:36:51.590 --> 04:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
but a hot dog isn't
 
04:36:54.629 --> 04:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
i believe the state has now
 
04:36:57.510 --> 04:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
in their present rules and correct me if
 
04:36:59.670 --> 04:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong allowed
 
04:37:02.789 --> 04:37:02.799 align:start position:0%
sausages and
 
04:37:04.150 --> 04:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
a dog
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
and i can't define what hot dog is
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
well you know it's kind of weird because
 
04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know you have a hot dog that's got
 
04:37:13.750 --> 04:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
pork and beef in it
 
04:37:13.760 --> 04:37:14.629 align:start position:0%
pork and beef in it
so

04:37:14.629 --> 04:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
what what's the difference between a hot
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
dog and a sausage
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's all got the natural natural casing
 
04:37:22.629 --> 04:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
or whether
 
04:37:25.109 --> 04:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
i i can't tell you that representative
 
04:37:27.750 --> 04:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
hot dog is pre-cooked a hot dog is made
 
04:37:31.029 --> 04:37:31.039 align:start position:0%
of of by meat by-products by definition
 
04:37:33.109 --> 04:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
whereas a sauce it's different for a
 
04:37:35.109 --> 04:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
sausage it's more natural
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
i'm just telling you what what what i
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
what was not what i researched
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
you know you learned something new every
 
04:37:41.279 --> 04:37:44.230 align:start position:0%
you know you learned something new every
day

04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative herbert has a question
 
04:37:46.320 --> 04:37:47.510 align:start position:0%
representative herbert has a question
for

04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:37:49.990 --> 04:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative wolf um
 
04:37:52.789 --> 04:37:52.799 align:start position:0%
would you believe um
 
04:37:55.590 --> 04:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
i i would like to have hot dog stands
 
04:37:58.150 --> 04:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
but i don't see any around i don't know
 
04:37:58.160 --> 04:38:01.029 align:start position:0%
but i don't see any around i don't know
why

04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:01.039 --> 04:38:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:38:01.830 --> 04:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:38:03.830 --> 04:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
just go down the street here on main
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
street between
 
04:38:08.230 --> 04:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
right next to them there's one there and
 
04:38:10.390 --> 04:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
following me
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
is and you will get copies of this
 
04:38:15.830 --> 04:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
sun uppy dogs which is a place that
 
04:38:15.840 --> 04:38:17.029 align:start position:0%
sun uppy dogs which is a place that
sells

04:38:17.029 --> 04:38:17.039 align:start position:0%
sells
 
04:38:19.109 --> 04:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
hot dogs that is inspected and licensed
 
04:38:21.670 --> 04:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
04:38:25.189 --> 04:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
and has a uh five bay serving dish

and has a uh five bay serving dish
etcetera

etcetera
 
04:38:28.789 --> 04:38:28.799 align:start position:0%
so you're gonna get you're gonna get
 
04:38:30.310 --> 04:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
that that's a big cart
 
04:38:33.109 --> 04:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
well it's not a very big carpet
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
yeah it's good sales okay
 
04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
any more questions for representative
 
04:38:39.590 --> 04:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
what license does the hot dog stand have
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
here on
 
04:38:42.230 --> 04:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
in concord
 
04:38:44.551 --> 04:38:44.561 align:start position:0%
he has to get a license from the state
 
04:38:45.910 --> 04:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire health and human
 
04:38:45.920 --> 04:38:47.510 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire health and human
services

04:38:47.510 --> 04:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
is it the same license i don't know
 
04:38:51.670 --> 04:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
we'll have to find out
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
i i believe the
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:01.349 --> 04:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
kobe from the state i'm sure is going to
 
04:39:03.910 --> 04:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
testify behind me and she can answer
 
04:39:05.590 --> 04:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
that i didn't realize i was following
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
the big production of the food trucks i
 
04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
just had a simple little house we are
 
04:39:13.670 --> 04:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
learning more about how to get
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
this is a whole new fast food world
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
all right all right thank you very much
 
04:39:22.310 --> 04:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
04:39:25.109 --> 04:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
04:39:30.869 --> 04:39:30.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:32.789 --> 04:39:32.799 align:start position:0%
oh wait here it is
 
04:39:37.590 --> 04:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:39.270 --> 04:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
these best people just give the cards to
 
04:39:48.390 --> 04:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:49.830 --> 04:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
i'm in a panic
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman hunt and thank
 
04:39:54.708 --> 04:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee uh so i am
 
04:39:55.910 --> 04:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
here to
 
04:39:58.708 --> 04:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
provide some information with regard to
 
04:40:00.788 --> 04:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
this bill and i can also
 
04:40:03.270 --> 04:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh in light of the previous bill
 
04:40:05.190 --> 04:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
explain some differences that might help
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
set the set the stage for this one so
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
what we were talking about before is a
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
food truck and we look at those a little
 
04:40:12.868 --> 04:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
bit differently than a push cart a push
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
cart it is
 
04:40:17.670 --> 04:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
the license fee is less money it has
 
04:40:21.430 --> 04:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
much less requirements a food truck
 
04:40:22.868 --> 04:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
that's licensed by the state would be
 
04:40:25.350 --> 04:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
required to have either a three-base
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
sink and a hand sink on board or in
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
commercial refrigeration or they'd have
 
04:40:33.030 --> 04:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
to work in tangent with a commercial
 
04:40:35.590 --> 04:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
kitchen in order to have those abilities
 
04:40:37.670 --> 04:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
push carts as it stands they have very
 
04:40:39.030 --> 04:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
minimal requirements they're just
 
04:40:41.590 --> 04:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
required to keep foods at the proper
 
04:40:43.910 --> 04:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
temperature control whether it be a
 
04:40:46.470 --> 04:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
cooler with ice in some instances but in
 
04:40:48.150 --> 04:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
that for that reason we we're very
 
04:40:49.750 --> 04:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
restrictive on the types of foods that
 
04:40:51.430 --> 04:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
they can offer they can offer only
 
04:40:53.910 --> 04:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
pre-packaged foods or
 
04:40:56.708 --> 04:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
what's also allowable as is frankfurters
 
04:40:59.510 --> 04:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i um it's been that way since i've
 
04:41:00.868 --> 04:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
been with the department just the
 
04:41:03.030 --> 04:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
allowance of frankfurters and i
 
04:41:04.868 --> 04:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
as i understand the history of that it's
 
04:41:07.350 --> 04:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
because if you start allowing sausages
 
04:41:09.110 --> 04:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
then the tendency would be to have
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
things like peppers and onions and
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
really why it's been so restrictive is
 
04:41:15.510 --> 04:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
because we don't want
 
04:41:17.350 --> 04:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
cooking in the outdoors the push carts
 
04:41:18.788 --> 04:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
aren't enclosed they're open to the
 
04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
elements so you have dust debris
 
04:41:21.840 --> 04:41:23.030 align:start position:0%
elements so you have dust debris
open

04:41:23.030 --> 04:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
open
 
04:41:25.830 --> 04:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
open cooking situations and also you the
 
04:41:27.590 --> 04:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
tendency would be to use maybe a home
 
04:41:29.510 --> 04:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
kitchen to support that
 
04:41:30.550 --> 04:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
and that's why we've been very
 
04:41:33.110 --> 04:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
restrictive on the types of condiments
 
04:41:35.990 --> 04:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
or and haven't allowed things such as
 
04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
sauerkraut or chili because we wouldn't
 
04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
know if it's coming from a can or if
 
04:41:42.070 --> 04:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's preparing it in their home
 
04:41:44.708 --> 04:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
which again isn't set up to cool foods
 
04:41:46.310 --> 04:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
properly keep them at proper
 
04:41:47.990 --> 04:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
temperatures it's subject to everything
 
04:41:50.310 --> 04:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
that's in a home kitchen whether it's
 
04:41:52.708 --> 04:41:52.718 align:start position:0%
you know children pets so forth is that
 
04:41:54.470 --> 04:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's very different standards than what
 
04:41:56.628 --> 04:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
a commercial kitchen is
 
04:41:59.430 --> 04:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
so um example of the the hot dog cart
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
that's in concord that would be licensed
 
04:42:03.430 --> 04:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
by the city and many of the cities they
 
04:42:06.070 --> 04:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
require a commissary relationship for
 
04:42:08.788 --> 04:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
these push cart situations so we don't
 
04:42:10.628 --> 04:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
require that and that's why we try to
 
04:42:12.310 --> 04:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
keep very
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
types of foods minimal
 
04:42:15.910 --> 04:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
there have been instances where we've
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
issued a variance one of the ski
 
04:42:20.150 --> 04:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
mountains last year came to us because
 
04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
they wanted to offer sausages
 
04:42:24.788 --> 04:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
because they were trying to keep folks
 
04:42:26.868 --> 04:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
outside and not inside due to the
 
04:42:28.708 --> 04:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
pandemic so we did grant a variance
 
04:42:30.310 --> 04:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
they're working in conjunction with the
 
04:42:32.470 --> 04:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen on site so as long as
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
they can demonstrate that they have a
 
04:42:35.830 --> 04:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen they can make those
 
04:42:37.590 --> 04:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
foods safely there have been instances
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
where we've offered offered of a
 
04:42:41.510 --> 04:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
variance to that the push cart
 
04:42:43.830 --> 04:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
regulation but you know certainly for
 
04:42:45.750 --> 04:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
the reasons that um
 
04:42:48.070 --> 04:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
that we don't require from to the
 
04:42:49.750 --> 04:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
initial licensing requirements are very
 
04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
minimal for push carts that's why we've
 
04:42:53.350 --> 04:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
really been restrictive on the types of
 
04:42:55.030 --> 04:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
foods that are allowed
 
04:42:57.190 --> 04:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
04:42:59.830 --> 04:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
the committee has representative johnson
 
04:43:02.070 --> 04:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that if
 
04:43:05.190 --> 04:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
they wanted to offer fresh onions
 
04:43:07.750 --> 04:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
mr cheer loves his onions
 
04:43:10.270 --> 04:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
if they got it from like they say a
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
prepackaged local farm stand
 
04:43:15.110 --> 04:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
and they offered it
 
04:43:18.628 --> 04:43:18.638 align:start position:0%
on their push cart they could do that
 
04:43:20.230 --> 04:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
but they can't buy the onion in the
 
04:43:21.910 --> 04:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
local store chop it up and put it on his
 
04:43:21.920 --> 04:43:22.788 align:start position:0%
local store chop it up and put it on his
cart

04:43:22.788 --> 04:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
cart
 
04:43:24.150 --> 04:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
that's what we're we're trying to
 
04:43:26.470 --> 04:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
restrict the amount of food prep because
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
again they if they don't have a
 
04:43:29.590 --> 04:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
relationship with a commercial kitchen
 
04:43:31.270 --> 04:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
they're either doing it outside or
 
04:43:32.948 --> 04:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
they're doing it in in their home
 
04:43:35.350 --> 04:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
kitchen but they so
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
they could go to like a local farm stand
 
04:43:39.190 --> 04:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
who usually has a deli or some type of
 
04:43:40.948 --> 04:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
thing where they have a regular kitchen
 
04:43:43.190 --> 04:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
they could buy the prepackaged
 
04:43:45.430 --> 04:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
they could buy like the onions and
 
04:43:48.070 --> 04:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
sauerkraut from the they
 
04:43:50.230 --> 04:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
they could cur they could buy like a
 
04:43:52.788 --> 04:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
great little prepackaged cup
 
04:43:52.798 --> 04:43:54.390 align:start position:0%
great little prepackaged cup
um

04:43:54.390 --> 04:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:55.830 --> 04:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
from another vendor
 
04:43:57.750 --> 04:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
hannaford's has
 
04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
the onions already chopped
 
04:44:01.830 --> 04:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
and wrapped
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
right they could buy a pre-packaged i
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
they could buy a pre-packaged onion to
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
offer there
 
04:44:07.920 --> 04:44:10.150 align:start position:0%
offer there
yes

04:44:10.150 --> 04:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:44:10.160 --> 04:44:12.230 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:44:14.788 --> 04:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
04:44:18.150 --> 04:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
just a quick uh question um
 
04:44:19.910 --> 04:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
this is a experience that i've had a
 
04:44:21.990 --> 04:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
small food truck hot dogs inside the
 
04:44:23.270 --> 04:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
food truck
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
very tiny
 
04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh i asked for relish or whatever it was
 
04:44:28.788 --> 04:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
condiments on my hot dog that i was
 
04:44:30.230 --> 04:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
buying through the window
 
04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the man said i am not i'm not
 
04:44:33.750 --> 04:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
allowed by the state to put this on your
 
04:44:35.830 --> 04:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
hot dog but outside the window was a
 
04:44:37.830 --> 04:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
whole array of different things
 
04:44:40.948 --> 04:44:40.958 align:start position:0%
was he telling me something
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
was he misunderstanding the law or was
 
04:44:45.270 --> 04:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
he not allowed to
 
04:44:48.310 --> 04:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
put the condiments on my on my hot dog
 
04:44:50.628 --> 04:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
i i'm not quite sure in that instance
 
04:44:52.470 --> 04:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
what he would have been doing wrong by
 
04:44:54.390 --> 04:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
preparing it for for you
 
04:44:56.550 --> 04:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
it sounds like he had a separate table
 
04:44:58.628 --> 04:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
is what you're saying
 
04:45:00.868 --> 04:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
and says i can't put it on you but you
 
04:45:04.150 --> 04:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:05.670 --> 04:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
he made it sound like it was illegal for
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
him to to serve it that's the way i
 
04:45:09.030 --> 04:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
interpret it
 
04:45:11.350 --> 04:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
but was it do was it his table full of
 
04:45:13.110 --> 04:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
onions and peppers it was it was
 
04:45:15.590 --> 04:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
literally within arm reach from him it
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:21.270 --> 04:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between serving it
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
and having it available
 
04:45:27.350 --> 04:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
not in their mind your mind is it
 
04:45:30.628 --> 04:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
so we we wouldn't preclude him from some
 
04:45:32.788 --> 04:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
from putting it on him himself it might
 
04:45:34.708 --> 04:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
have been maybe a misunderstanding or
 
04:45:36.628 --> 04:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
maybe his decision didn't he didn't want
 
04:45:37.590 --> 04:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
it didn't want to take that
 
04:45:37.600 --> 04:45:39.190 align:start position:0%
it didn't want to take that
responsibility

04:45:39.190 --> 04:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:45:41.910 --> 04:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
well but let's again we're talking about
 
04:45:44.628 --> 04:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
a push cart okay and he chopped up the
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
onions at home
 
04:45:49.350 --> 04:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
and he puts it on a table that's six
 
04:45:53.750 --> 04:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:56.230 --> 04:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
well it's just saying if he if he had he
 
04:45:58.628 --> 04:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
can't put it on himself because he
 
04:46:01.430 --> 04:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
chopped the onions up at home oh i see
 
04:46:04.070 --> 04:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
he's trying to get around it exactly by
 
04:46:06.470 --> 04:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
saying this he didn't put it on there
 
04:46:08.708 --> 04:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
it's over there you can go get it he's
 
04:46:10.310 --> 04:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
not selling it i would say that was
 
04:46:12.390 --> 04:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
illegal right i mean that would i would
 
04:46:12.400 --> 04:46:13.190 align:start position:0%
illegal right i mean that would i would
say

04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
if it's yeah that sounds like it would
 
04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
that air that would still be under his
 
04:46:18.868 --> 04:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
control and part of his
 
04:46:21.430 --> 04:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
food establishment so i would say he
 
04:46:25.030 --> 04:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:27.030 --> 04:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay so so let me get this right so as
 
04:46:29.830 --> 04:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
long as they're getting the onions
 
04:46:31.510 --> 04:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
chopped up
 
04:46:33.670 --> 04:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
from hannafords
 
04:46:35.910 --> 04:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
in a pre-package
 
04:46:37.750 --> 04:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
and getting
 
04:46:39.910 --> 04:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
ormel's chili
 
04:46:41.990 --> 04:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
in a can
 
04:46:44.788 --> 04:46:44.798 align:start position:0%
is he allowed to heat that chili up so
 
04:46:46.708 --> 04:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
we would allow the thing the
 
04:46:48.868 --> 04:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
pre-packaged because there's not any
 
04:46:50.470 --> 04:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
prep doing what happening with those
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
onions right but the chili part of it
 
04:46:52.638 --> 04:46:53.430 align:start position:0%
onions right but the chili part of it
that's

04:46:53.430 --> 04:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:46:55.350 --> 04:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
that would wouldn't allow as it stands
 
04:46:56.868 --> 04:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
you can't have a chili dough because
 
04:46:59.190 --> 04:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
it's considered food preparation and so
 
04:47:02.390 --> 04:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
and it it just it lends itself to it
 
04:47:03.750 --> 04:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
04:47:05.910 --> 04:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
leads itself to other things because you
 
04:47:07.350 --> 04:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
know what happens at the end of the day
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
and he doesn't want to throw that chili
 
04:47:09.910 --> 04:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
out so where does he bring it home he
 
04:47:12.868 --> 04:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
brings it home to his um he brings it to
 
04:47:14.788 --> 04:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
his refrigerator or how does he cleaning
 
04:47:16.708 --> 04:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
it he's cleaning it he's got to clean
 
04:47:18.150 --> 04:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
that pan where is that happening and
 
04:47:20.150 --> 04:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
right now as i mentioned we have very
 
04:47:22.310 --> 04:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
minimal requirements for we don't
 
04:47:25.110 --> 04:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
require them to have sinks on board
 
04:47:26.628 --> 04:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
so that's why we've been very
 
04:47:28.550 --> 04:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
restrictive to the types of menu items
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
that they could that they could offer
 
04:47:32.150 --> 04:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
because they're not required to have
 
04:47:33.830 --> 04:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
them on board or work with a commercial
 
04:47:33.840 --> 04:47:35.990 align:start position:0%
them on board or work with a commercial
kitchen

04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
kitchen
 
04:47:37.670 --> 04:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my so again kind of
 
04:47:41.910 --> 04:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
going back to the onion thing they could
 
04:47:45.030 --> 04:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
go and then purchase chili from
 
04:47:47.270 --> 04:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
somebody else who has the commercial
 
04:47:47.280 --> 04:47:48.470 align:start position:0%
somebody else who has the commercial
kitchen

04:47:48.470 --> 04:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
kitchen
 
04:47:51.430 --> 04:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
get the pre-made chili from another
 
04:47:52.868 --> 04:47:52.878 align:start position:0%
local vendor
 
04:47:55.110 --> 04:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
and serve it that way
 
04:47:59.110 --> 04:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
but he can't make the chili and serve it
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
but he could get it pre-packaged from a
 
04:48:03.510 --> 04:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
local restaurant and serve it so he goes
 
04:48:05.910 --> 04:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
to a restaurant and says oh we'll take a
 
04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
so again that become that would become a
 
04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
little bit more complicated because we
 
04:48:15.350 --> 04:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
would look to how they would still have
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
to dispense that chili and unless they
 
04:48:19.110 --> 04:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
were pre-packaging it into individual
 
04:48:20.788 --> 04:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
containers but then they'd have to keep
 
04:48:22.550 --> 04:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
it warm i think there would be a little
 
04:48:24.868 --> 04:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
04:48:26.948 --> 04:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
difficulty in doing a chili situation
 
04:48:29.030 --> 04:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
because likely they're getting a a
 
04:48:30.310 --> 04:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
container they're going to have to keep
 
04:48:31.910 --> 04:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
that hot they're going to have to ladle
 
04:48:33.670 --> 04:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
that out they're going to have to clean
 
04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
all of those things at the end of the
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
day a chili is a little bit different
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
animal than than the cut onions in the
 
04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
package how many states you think are as
 
04:48:44.550 --> 04:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
strict as as we are about
 
04:48:46.708 --> 04:48:46.718 align:start position:0%
this well i would say i sure feel like
 
04:48:48.230 --> 04:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
i've had a chili dog somewhere a long
 
04:48:50.070 --> 04:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
way but maybe not
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
i would say that so again just going
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
back to we we have very minimal
 
04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
requirements so if i got that we could
 
04:48:57.750 --> 04:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
we could have them work with a
 
04:49:00.070 --> 04:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
commissary kitchen and allow these
 
04:49:02.708 --> 04:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
things to happen um as do many of the
 
04:49:04.868 --> 04:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
self-inspecting but currently we don't
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
require as a condition to get a license
 
04:49:08.708 --> 04:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
them to have an agreement with a
 
04:49:10.390 --> 04:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
commissary kitchen
 
04:49:12.150 --> 04:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
and and we have and as
 
04:49:14.788 --> 04:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
we have let places we have issued
 
04:49:17.750 --> 04:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
variances to to this rule if they can
 
04:49:19.430 --> 04:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
show that they do have a commissary
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
license to to work with
 
04:49:23.110 --> 04:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
so right because you mentioned the
 
04:49:24.868 --> 04:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
commissary license earlier so and i
 
04:49:27.030 --> 04:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
never heard that before uh i'm learning
 
04:49:29.430 --> 04:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
so much today but
 
04:49:31.190 --> 04:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
the comments are licensed how much is
 
04:49:33.030 --> 04:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
that license
 
04:49:35.590 --> 04:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
so it would they'd have to have they'd
 
04:49:37.910 --> 04:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
have to have an agreement with the one
 
04:49:39.430 --> 04:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
either the
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
commissary could they might not need a
 
04:49:43.830 --> 04:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
license there if the commissary is doing
 
04:49:45.590 --> 04:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
everything before the commissary is the
 
04:49:48.150 --> 04:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
restaurant next door
 
04:49:50.070 --> 04:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
so the restaurant next door is fully
 
04:49:52.230 --> 04:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
licensed restaurant they could get their
 
04:49:54.390 --> 04:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
chili from there
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
they could have an agreement with them
 
04:49:57.910 --> 04:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
that that commissary is taking
 
04:50:00.150 --> 04:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the cleanup and the
 
04:50:01.750 --> 04:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
food preparation if they want to
 
04:50:04.070 --> 04:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
actually do food preparation there if
 
04:50:05.510 --> 04:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
they want to make their own wrap
 
04:50:07.510 --> 04:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
sandwiches or their own chili then
 
04:50:09.590 --> 04:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
they'd have to have a license at that
 
04:50:12.230 --> 04:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
restaurant but if they if the restaurant
 
04:50:14.070 --> 04:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
is doing it's providing the chili for
 
04:50:15.590 --> 04:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
them providing the chili providing the
 
04:50:17.990 --> 04:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
cleanup we wouldn't require a license we
 
04:50:20.310 --> 04:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
would just require proof that the other
 
04:50:21.750 --> 04:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
place is licensed and that they have
 
04:50:24.550 --> 04:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
this agreement so there's no connoisseur
 
04:50:26.708 --> 04:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
there's no actual license them doing
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's just that they're already licensed
 
04:50:30.628 --> 04:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
a restaurant so he just has to
 
04:50:30.638 --> 04:50:31.590 align:start position:0%
a restaurant so he just has to
show

04:50:31.590 --> 04:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
show
 
04:50:33.350 --> 04:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
some written agreement
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
that they have with
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
some restaurant
 
04:50:39.990 --> 04:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
that they that
 
04:50:40.000 --> 04:50:40.708 align:start position:0%
that they that
they

04:50:40.708 --> 04:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:50:42.230 --> 04:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
that restaurant will take care of the
 
04:50:44.230 --> 04:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
cleanup and everything like that so
 
04:50:45.750 --> 04:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
should we just put that in the statute
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
so people see that and know that that's
 
04:50:48.000 --> 04:50:49.030 align:start position:0%
so people see that and know that that's
true

04:50:49.030 --> 04:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:50:49.040 --> 04:50:49.990 align:start position:0%
true
so

04:50:49.990 --> 04:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:52.868 --> 04:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
again we do we have um had this happen
 
04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
with a variance but if they're if you
 
04:50:59.430 --> 04:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
know i i i guess if there needs to be
 
04:51:01.270 --> 04:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
clarity that
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
um around this that that's a
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
possibility i mean i want a chili dog
 
04:51:07.520 --> 04:51:09.270 align:start position:0%
possibility i mean i want a chili dog
sometimes

04:51:09.270 --> 04:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
04:51:11.750 --> 04:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative abel
 
04:51:13.350 --> 04:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you for
 
04:51:13.360 --> 04:51:14.390 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you for
testifying

04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
04:51:17.190 --> 04:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh pardon me if if you uh have said this
 
04:51:19.590 --> 04:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
before but does the
 
04:51:23.670 --> 04:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
the excuse me does the department um
 
04:51:25.830 --> 04:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
take a position on this bill or are you
 
04:51:29.910 --> 04:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
neutral or what well we are we have cons
 
04:51:32.310 --> 04:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
definitely have concerns um you know as
 
04:51:34.470 --> 04:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
i've provided some written testimony
 
04:51:36.310 --> 04:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
there as an example
 
04:51:38.150 --> 04:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
something is you might think as simple
 
04:51:40.150 --> 04:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
as a cheese sauce that there have been
 
04:51:42.070 --> 04:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
outbreaks of botulism outbreak that
 
04:51:44.708 --> 04:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
actually sickened 10 people and killed
 
04:51:47.670 --> 04:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
another in california in recent years
 
04:51:47.680 --> 04:51:48.628 align:start position:0%
another in california in recent years
because

04:51:48.628 --> 04:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:51:50.708 --> 04:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
if these pla if these materials aren't
 
04:51:53.110 --> 04:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
cleaned properly um that there there
 
04:51:54.708 --> 04:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
could be outbreaks associated with them
 
04:51:57.910 --> 04:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
so we definitely have concerns with the
 
04:52:01.590 --> 04:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
bill as written be unless we could again
 
04:52:03.670 --> 04:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
allow allow for those relationships that
 
04:52:05.030 --> 04:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
they're at least going to a commercial
 
04:52:05.040 --> 04:52:05.910 align:start position:0%
they're at least going to a commercial
kitchen

04:52:05.910 --> 04:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
kitchen
 
04:52:07.510 --> 04:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day to
 
04:52:09.670 --> 04:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
either do the food preparation and clean
 
04:52:09.680 --> 04:52:11.430 align:start position:0%
either do the food preparation and clean
up

04:52:11.430 --> 04:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:52:11.440 --> 04:52:12.948 align:start position:0%
up
representative

04:52:12.948 --> 04:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:52:14.470 --> 04:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i think there's some
 
04:52:17.350 --> 04:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding on the onions um for
 
04:52:19.830 --> 04:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
example if i went to hannaford's and
 
04:52:21.110 --> 04:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
bought a
 
04:52:23.030 --> 04:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
little little tray of onions and i
 
04:52:25.590 --> 04:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
scooped it out for each hot dog that
 
04:52:27.510 --> 04:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't work but if i had no she said
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
it would work that would be legal no i
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
think it has to be a single unit like
 
04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
the ketchup and the mustard in a single
 
04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
unit the chili could be in a single unit
 
04:52:39.430 --> 04:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
and the onions have to be in a single
 
04:52:42.310 --> 04:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
unit i couldn't buy six ounces of onions
 
04:52:42.320 --> 04:52:43.190 align:start position:0%
unit i couldn't buy six ounces of onions
and

04:52:43.190 --> 04:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:52:45.110 --> 04:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
teaspoon them out every time somebody
 
04:52:46.948 --> 04:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
wants onions on their dough can you
 
04:52:48.628 --> 04:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
clarify that because i was thinking
 
04:52:48.638 --> 04:52:49.750 align:start position:0%
clarify that because i was thinking
differently

04:52:49.750 --> 04:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
differently
 
04:52:51.350 --> 04:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
do you know what we're talking about
 
04:52:53.910 --> 04:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's you know in hannaford's it's
 
04:52:55.350 --> 04:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
in between their vegetables and their
 
04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
lettuce and they have these pre-made
 
04:52:59.430 --> 04:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
things where you can get
 
04:53:00.788 --> 04:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
purple you know they get the you know
 
04:53:02.230 --> 04:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
the purple onion and they have the
 
04:53:04.830 --> 04:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
yellow onion it's already
 
04:53:07.510 --> 04:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
pre-chopped it's packaged it's sealed
 
04:53:09.750 --> 04:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
but it's not individual it's
 
04:53:11.430 --> 04:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to have
 
04:53:14.230 --> 04:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
10 servings in it
 
04:53:14.240 --> 04:53:15.910 align:start position:0%
10 servings in it
so

04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:17.670 --> 04:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
we would like to see those be like
 
04:53:19.430 --> 04:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
individually packaged because again
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
we're trying to minimize minimalize the
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
open food and the dispensing of food is
 
04:53:26.390 --> 04:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
is knowing that these are carts are very
 
04:53:26.400 --> 04:53:27.350 align:start position:0%
is knowing that these are carts are very
um

04:53:27.350 --> 04:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:29.590 --> 04:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
they're open to the air and there isn't
 
04:53:31.350 --> 04:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
those supporting
 
04:53:31.360 --> 04:53:33.430 align:start position:0%
those supporting
supporting

04:53:33.430 --> 04:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
04:53:35.670 --> 04:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
services with clean up that to try to
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
keep the
 
04:53:39.510 --> 04:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
other activities as minimal as possible
 
04:53:41.670 --> 04:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
okay so it had to be an individual
 
04:53:43.990 --> 04:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
survey package yes and unfortunately uh
 
04:53:46.070 --> 04:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
being from pittsburgh and heinz
 
04:53:48.390 --> 04:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
they actually do have that product with
 
04:53:48.400 --> 04:53:49.430 align:start position:0%
they actually do have that product with
onions

04:53:49.430 --> 04:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
onions
 
04:53:51.670 --> 04:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen it very often but i know
 
04:53:53.510 --> 04:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
it does exist
 
04:53:55.350 --> 04:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
04:53:55.360 --> 04:53:57.030 align:start position:0%
so okay
representation

04:53:57.030 --> 04:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
representation
 
04:53:58.868 --> 04:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:54:01.430 --> 04:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
under the old adages when in rome do as
 
04:54:03.750 --> 04:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
the romans do or if you can't
 
04:54:05.670 --> 04:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
if you can't beat them join them i'm
 
04:54:07.670 --> 04:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
gonna weigh in with a question um about
 
04:54:07.680 --> 04:54:09.510 align:start position:0%
gonna weigh in with a question um about
sauerkraut

04:54:09.510 --> 04:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
sauerkraut
 
04:54:09.520 --> 04:54:10.788 align:start position:0%
sauerkraut
uh

04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:12.150 --> 04:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's my turn
 
04:54:14.868 --> 04:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
so so i understand if i if i buy a
 
04:54:17.670 --> 04:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
package of sauerkraut i run a food cart
 
04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh or a push cart or whatever and i buy
 
04:54:22.390 --> 04:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
a package of sauerkraut at hannaford's
 
04:54:24.390 --> 04:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
then i can serve the sauerkraut
 
04:54:24.400 --> 04:54:25.510 align:start position:0%
then i can serve the sauerkraut
um

04:54:25.510 --> 04:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:28.070 --> 04:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
or i can't serve the sauerkraut
 
04:54:29.910 --> 04:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
unless it's an individual serving
 
04:54:31.590 --> 04:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
package right we're asking that they
 
04:54:33.590 --> 04:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
would be preaching it's pre-packaged
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
sauerkraut we're out of a can yes okay
 
04:54:39.270 --> 04:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
that's fine yes okay now we come to the
 
04:54:40.550 --> 04:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
end of the day but it has to be
 
04:54:46.310 --> 04:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:48.150 --> 04:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
i've never seen individual servings of
 
04:54:48.160 --> 04:54:51.350 align:start position:0%
i've never seen individual servings of
sauerkraut

04:54:51.350 --> 04:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:53.350 --> 04:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me are you talking so are you
 
04:54:55.110 --> 04:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
talking about individual servings of
 
04:54:58.150 --> 04:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
sauerkraut yes individuals oh okay so
 
04:54:59.350 --> 04:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about a package of
 
04:55:01.750 --> 04:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
sauerkraut that i that i empty into a
 
04:55:03.670 --> 04:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
warming tray and then i put that on the
 
04:55:06.070 --> 04:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
hot dogs for the customers no they have
 
04:55:07.430 --> 04:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
to be individual
 
04:55:09.190 --> 04:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
have you ever seen an individual packet
 
04:55:11.110 --> 04:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
of sauerkraut
 
04:55:13.270 --> 04:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
therefore made it impossible for people
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
to to per have sauerkraut on their hot
 
04:55:18.230 --> 04:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
dogs in the state of new hampshire
 
04:55:19.750 --> 04:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
how could that be done
 
04:55:21.350 --> 04:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
i'm very concerned because i love
 
04:55:23.670 --> 04:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
sauerkraut and i i'm concerned about
 
04:55:27.670 --> 04:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:31.750 --> 04:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
basically the point is you can do it
 
04:55:31.760 --> 04:55:32.628 align:start position:0%
basically the point is you can do it
if

04:55:32.628 --> 04:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:55:32.638 --> 04:55:33.430 align:start position:0%
if
a

04:55:33.430 --> 04:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:55:35.590 --> 04:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
you have an agreement with some other
 
04:55:35.600 --> 04:55:37.350 align:start position:0%
you have an agreement with some other
restaurant

04:55:37.350 --> 04:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
04:55:38.868 --> 04:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
who is going to provide you that
 
04:55:41.830 --> 04:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
sauerkraut properly heated and they will
 
04:55:43.350 --> 04:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
clean it at the end of the day when
 
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
you're finished with it who will
 
04:55:49.190 --> 04:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
the restaurant the restaurant will clean
 
04:55:51.670 --> 04:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
the sauerkraut clean the pot that you
 
04:55:53.510 --> 04:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
put it in and whatever they will what
 
04:55:54.868 --> 04:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
about the leftover sauerkraut it goes
 
04:55:56.550 --> 04:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
back to the restaurant you would get you
 
04:55:58.230 --> 04:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
would take it back to them and then they
 
04:55:59.830 --> 04:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
have their own and then they really
 
04:56:01.510 --> 04:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
didn't send it to me the next day and
 
04:56:02.948 --> 04:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
theoretically they'll they're
 
04:56:05.510 --> 04:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
responsible to make sure that it is safe
 
04:56:07.990 --> 04:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
to be served the following day thank you
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:11.520 --> 04:56:13.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:56:13.270 --> 04:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:56:16.550 --> 04:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
are you all set represented terry
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
yes i got my sauerkraut question
 
04:56:21.510 --> 04:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative not german but i
 
04:56:23.590 --> 04:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
like south korea
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony um i'm
 
04:56:28.070 --> 04:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
going to reference probably the largest
 
04:56:30.788 --> 04:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
push cart city in the world new york
 
04:56:30.798 --> 04:56:31.910 align:start position:0%
push cart city in the world new york
city

04:56:31.910 --> 04:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
city
 
04:56:35.350 --> 04:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
are you aware of the rules that they are
 
04:56:35.360 --> 04:56:36.390 align:start position:0%
are you aware of the rules that they are
using

04:56:36.390 --> 04:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
using
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
because i used to live in northern new
 
04:56:40.868 --> 04:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
jersey i frequented a lot of push carts
 
04:56:42.310 --> 04:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
in new york city
 
04:56:45.030 --> 04:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
and nobody i know of ever got sick so
 
04:56:46.628 --> 04:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
they must have some pretty good rules
 
04:56:48.070 --> 04:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
are you aware of whether this might
 
04:56:50.550 --> 04:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
explain a lot about you drawing so
 
04:56:54.150 --> 04:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
so i do know i again of many of the
 
04:56:56.868 --> 04:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
cities do require that commissary
 
04:56:59.110 --> 04:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
relationship and then also and i do know
 
04:57:01.990 --> 04:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
just i recently was in new york city
 
04:57:04.390 --> 04:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
last fall and looked at one and they are
 
04:57:06.550 --> 04:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
fully enclosed though they're not open
 
04:57:08.788 --> 04:57:08.798 align:start position:0%
push at least the one i saw wasn't a it
 
04:57:10.948 --> 04:57:10.958 align:start position:0%
was it was they do have a plastic cover
 
04:57:12.708 --> 04:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
around it it was like an actual like
 
04:57:12.718 --> 04:57:13.670 align:start position:0%
around it it was like an actual like
little

04:57:13.670 --> 04:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know like a brick built sure
 
04:57:17.270 --> 04:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
that wasn't for covid they had it all
 
04:57:19.910 --> 04:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
closed it was it was um an actual
 
04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
enclosed fully enclosed unit and so and
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
we that's again like a push cart so
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
certainly if you wanted to have um
 
04:57:29.350 --> 04:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
sauerkrauts and
 
04:57:32.470 --> 04:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
sausage and onions and and had a full
 
04:57:34.708 --> 04:57:34.718 align:start position:0%
food truck that's perfectly allowable
 
04:57:36.628 --> 04:57:36.638 align:start position:0%
but again those usually have a
 
04:57:38.390 --> 04:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
three-based sink on board or working
 
04:57:41.830 --> 04:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
with a commissary so again we're really
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
because and we have right now we have 30
 
04:57:46.150 --> 04:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
license in the state just to give
 
04:57:48.070 --> 04:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
perspective on how many push cart
 
04:57:49.990 --> 04:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
situations that we have
 
04:57:51.670 --> 04:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
compared to the mobile units the mobile
 
04:57:53.510 --> 04:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
units we definitely have much many more
 
04:57:56.470 --> 04:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:56.480 --> 04:57:58.948 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:57:58.948 --> 04:57:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:58.958 --> 04:58:00.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:58:00.390 --> 04:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative bullet yeah um
 
04:58:05.830 --> 04:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
i did own a restaurant for many years
 
04:58:07.910 --> 04:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
and in the business plan i did some
 
04:58:10.390 --> 04:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
research and researching i i knew
 
04:58:11.830 --> 04:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what i needed to do as a
 
04:58:13.030 --> 04:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
business owner
 
04:58:15.750 --> 04:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion instead of this
 
04:58:18.070 --> 04:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
legislation is
 
04:58:20.390 --> 04:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
a food truck association which would
 
04:58:22.550 --> 04:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
include the push carts so that all of
 
04:58:24.390 --> 04:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
the people that own these
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
entities would be able to get together
 
04:58:31.830 --> 04:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
and educate you know each other on how
 
04:58:34.230 --> 04:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
to operate in you know in the state of
 
04:58:39.670 --> 04:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:39.680 --> 04:58:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:58:41.510 --> 04:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:58:41.520 --> 04:58:42.470 align:start position:0%
okay
so

04:58:42.470 --> 04:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:44.948 --> 04:58:44.958 align:start position:0%
the last question this legislation uh it
 
04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
says um
 
04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
the create look it's in rulemaking so
 
04:58:52.788 --> 04:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
this whole thing about having a
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
conversation having a restaurant
 
04:58:57.270 --> 04:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
connected to it is that in rules now is
 
04:58:59.190 --> 04:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
someone is that available for someone to
 
04:59:02.150 --> 04:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
see that uh now or is that a policy that
 
04:59:04.708 --> 04:59:04.718 align:start position:0%
you guys have in-house so right now
 
04:59:07.670 --> 04:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
their only vehicle to to expand beyond
 
04:59:10.070 --> 04:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
what's currently stated in the
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
definition of a push cart is to do that
 
04:59:14.390 --> 04:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
through a variance process and through a
 
04:59:17.030 --> 04:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
variance we right we'd ask to see you
 
04:59:18.550 --> 04:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
know how they're going to meet the
 
04:59:20.708 --> 04:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
intent the public health intent of of
 
04:59:22.390 --> 04:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
the rule which would be
 
04:59:24.550 --> 04:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
to have that those supporting services
 
04:59:26.788 --> 04:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
like a commissary if the wisdom in this
 
04:59:28.310 --> 04:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee that would really want you to
 
04:59:30.390 --> 04:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
create rules so that someone can figure
 
04:59:32.390 --> 04:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
this out and understand is this
 
04:59:35.350 --> 04:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
legislation okay for you to
 
04:59:37.590 --> 04:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
if we if we if we really want to make
 
04:59:37.600 --> 04:59:38.550 align:start position:0%
if we if we if we really want to make
sure

04:59:38.550 --> 04:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:59:41.590 --> 04:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
that is that anybody who has a push cart
 
04:59:41.600 --> 04:59:43.190 align:start position:0%
that is that anybody who has a push cart
knows

04:59:43.190 --> 04:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
knows
 
04:59:45.350 --> 04:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
that it might not be that bad all they
 
04:59:47.910 --> 04:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
have to do is get some an arrangement
 
04:59:49.270 --> 04:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
with somebody
 
04:59:50.310 --> 04:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
is this
 
04:59:52.628 --> 04:59:52.638 align:start position:0%
the way this uh bill is written is that
 
04:59:54.868 --> 04:59:54.878 align:start position:0%
okay for you to get that done if we
 
04:59:56.708 --> 04:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
could work through that in rule yes that
 
04:59:59.670 --> 04:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
would be acceptable okay okay
 
05:00:03.910 --> 05:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:15.430 --> 05:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
how do you pronounce your your last name
 
05:00:17.430 --> 05:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's hook straw hook straw it's going to
 
05:00:19.750 --> 05:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
say it's like h-o-o
 
05:00:23.910 --> 05:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:23.920 --> 05:00:27.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:00:27.510 --> 05:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:29.670 --> 05:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
so a good afternoon everyone uh thank
 
05:00:31.750 --> 05:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
you committee for allowing me to testify

we're right in the harbor
 
05:01:09.750 --> 05:01:09.760 align:start position:0%

05:01:15.510 --> 05:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
i support the bill because i had many
 
05:01:18.310 --> 05:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
many many people like
 
05:01:20.310 --> 05:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
a representative here ask me if i could
 
05:01:22.230 --> 05:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
sell put chili
 
05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
and sauerkraut on the hot dog
 
05:01:28.150 --> 05:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question sir about
 
05:01:28.160 --> 05:01:29.590 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question sir about
sauerkraut

05:01:29.590 --> 05:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
sauerkraut
 
05:01:31.910 --> 05:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
you can buy small little packages of
 
05:01:31.920 --> 05:01:33.350 align:start position:0%
you can buy small little packages of
sauerkraut

05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
sauerkraut
 
05:01:36.550 --> 05:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
that costs about 75 cents a piece
 
05:01:39.910 --> 05:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i included that in my three dollar
 
05:01:43.430 --> 05:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
hot dog charge this year because i felt
 
05:01:45.030 --> 05:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
it was appropriate that people were able
 
05:01:46.550 --> 05:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
to get sauerkraut
 
05:01:48.550 --> 05:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
on the hot dog so that was the only way
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
i was able to do it to your question
 
05:01:53.830 --> 05:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
about onions we did buy heinz onions
 
05:01:55.430 --> 05:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
that were pre-packaged
 
05:01:57.190 --> 05:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
and those were also included and those
 
05:01:59.350 --> 05:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
were about 30 cents each
 
05:02:01.990 --> 05:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
and that was part of the hot dog cost
 
05:02:03.910 --> 05:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
you charge extra for these things no i
 
05:02:05.590 --> 05:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
didn't charge extra at all
 
05:02:05.600 --> 05:02:07.270 align:start position:0%
didn't charge extra at all
so

05:02:07.270 --> 05:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
it was a great summer
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i learned a lot and i can't wait to
 
05:02:16.310 --> 05:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to answer a few questions
 
05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
it all gets cleaned there's pictures you
 
05:02:29.030 --> 05:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
can see that you're past i passed around
 
05:02:31.670 --> 05:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
of the hot dog cart itself
 
05:02:31.680 --> 05:02:32.550 align:start position:0%
of the hot dog cart itself
um

05:02:32.550 --> 05:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:34.390 --> 05:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty pimped out and it doesn't
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
look like it got a lot a lot of stuff
 
05:02:38.310 --> 05:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
here that looks like a sink is that a so
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
we have four sinks on our hot dog cart
 
05:02:42.230 --> 05:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
so when that
 
05:02:44.070 --> 05:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover you for washing your
 
05:02:45.910 --> 05:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
dishes and it does not because it
 
05:02:47.670 --> 05:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't it's not a commerce it's not a
 
05:02:51.670 --> 05:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:51.680 --> 05:02:58.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:02:58.230 --> 05:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:58.240 --> 05:02:59.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:02:59.190 --> 05:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:03:01.990 --> 05:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
cool any questions yes yeah um thank you
 
05:03:03.270 --> 05:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you for taking the
 
05:03:06.470 --> 05:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
question did you do uh research um or
 
05:03:08.550 --> 05:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
did you um
 
05:03:10.390 --> 05:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh get information from the health
 
05:03:12.470 --> 05:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
department regarding a commissary if you
 
05:03:14.310 --> 05:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
do partner up with the commissary that
 
05:03:15.910 --> 05:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
may be what
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
you would need
 
05:03:19.590 --> 05:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
i did get information from the
 
05:03:21.270 --> 05:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
department about a commissary
 
05:03:21.280 --> 05:03:25.270 align:start position:0%
department about a commissary
relationship

05:03:25.270 --> 05:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:27.350 --> 05:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'm quite frankly not interested in that
 
05:03:29.670 --> 05:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
simply because i don't think any of the
 
05:03:32.150 --> 05:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
kitchens in town who are already upset
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
that i opened up a hot dog right your
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
competition to them are going to extend
 
05:03:37.510 --> 05:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
the good will
 
05:03:39.830 --> 05:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
to allow me to use their kitchens
 
05:03:41.350 --> 05:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:03:43.510 --> 05:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
in competition with them
 
05:03:45.110 --> 05:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
just it simply it won't happen in santa
 
05:03:47.990 --> 05:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
fe but maybe somewhere else
 
05:03:52.150 --> 05:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
so i didn't understand this entire
 
05:03:52.160 --> 05:03:53.270 align:start position:0%
so i didn't understand this entire
um

05:03:53.270 --> 05:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:56.470 --> 05:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
the restrictions on this license
 
05:03:59.750 --> 05:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
and up until i understood it i was ready
 
05:04:01.910 --> 05:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
to sell everything
 
05:04:05.030 --> 05:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
and it simplified my menu dramatically
 
05:04:07.190 --> 05:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
so we served hot dogs with ketchup
 
05:04:09.110 --> 05:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
mustard relish
 
05:04:10.948 --> 05:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
onions packages
 
05:04:13.270 --> 05:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
sauerkraut packages
 
05:04:17.110 --> 05:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:18.948 --> 05:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
and we did we had we had a fabulous
 
05:04:18.958 --> 05:04:19.910 align:start position:0%
and we did we had we had a fabulous
summer

05:04:19.910 --> 05:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
summer
 
05:04:21.830 --> 05:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
but i'll bet two-thirds of the people
 
05:04:23.270 --> 05:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
asked me if i could put something else
 
05:04:26.390 --> 05:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
on my hot dog or their hot dog
 
05:04:28.470 --> 05:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
and a representative was one of those
 
05:04:28.480 --> 05:04:30.150 align:start position:0%
and a representative was one of those
yeah

05:04:30.150 --> 05:04:30.160 align:start position:0%

05:04:40.390 --> 05:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
did you have to serve the packets cold
 
05:04:40.400 --> 05:04:41.510 align:start position:0%
did you have to serve the packets cold
the

05:04:41.510 --> 05:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:04:44.070 --> 05:04:44.080 align:start position:0%

on the hot dogs for anybody
 
05:04:54.310 --> 05:04:54.320 align:start position:0%

05:05:02.788 --> 05:05:02.798 align:start position:0%
hot dog around yeah sometimes
 
05:05:04.390 --> 05:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
sauerkraut's always better
 
05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:08.400 --> 05:05:10.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:05:10.470 --> 05:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:05:12.948 --> 05:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
yes here's my question given the rules
 
05:05:15.270 --> 05:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
that we just heard about if you had an
 
05:05:18.628 --> 05:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
enclosure over your hot dog stand would
 
05:05:20.550 --> 05:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
there be would you still would you then
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
be able to sell these things because
 
05:05:23.670 --> 05:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be the concern about the
 
05:05:25.990 --> 05:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
dust and and the and the the other
 
05:05:27.270 --> 05:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
things no
 
05:05:27.280 --> 05:05:28.550 align:start position:0%
things no
no

05:05:28.550 --> 05:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:05:30.550 --> 05:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
if it was completely enclosed
 
05:05:33.510 --> 05:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
i would have to be inside of
 
05:05:35.110 --> 05:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
an enclosure
 
05:05:37.590 --> 05:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
serving out of a window in order to do
 
05:05:37.600 --> 05:05:39.430 align:start position:0%
serving out of a window in order to do
this

05:05:39.430 --> 05:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:05:42.310 --> 05:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
yes that would be fine okay that's
 
05:05:44.070 --> 05:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
pretty cool but that's not my hot dog
 
05:05:51.510 --> 05:05:51.520 align:start position:0%

expressed
 
05:06:11.510 --> 05:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
by the department that others besides
 
05:06:12.948 --> 05:06:12.958 align:start position:0%

uh is that is that correct
 
05:06:20.788 --> 05:06:20.798 align:start position:0%

push carts in our state yeah
 
05:06:24.948 --> 05:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely
 
05:06:27.430 --> 05:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
and it makes the further question
 
05:06:29.350 --> 05:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up and now i'm forgetting what it
 
05:06:32.310 --> 05:06:32.320 align:start position:0%

okay thank you um
 
05:06:35.910 --> 05:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
and this is for you and uh
 
05:06:35.920 --> 05:06:36.830 align:start position:0%
and this is for you and uh
representative

05:06:36.830 --> 05:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:06:40.230 --> 05:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
i the problem of this bill the way it's
 
05:06:41.990 --> 05:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
written is that you're giving it to the
 
05:06:44.070 --> 05:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
department to make rules
 
05:06:46.390 --> 05:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
which doesn't necessarily mean
 
05:06:47.990 --> 05:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to like the rule that they
 
05:06:49.990 --> 05:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
05:06:51.270 --> 05:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
because they might just come back they
 
05:06:53.350 --> 05:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
just might turn this rule into
 
05:06:58.390 --> 05:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:02.070 --> 05:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
it's the cost of doing business
 
05:07:08.310 --> 05:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:11.830 --> 05:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
right you gotta have a sign saying
 
05:07:13.270 --> 05:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's department of health and
 
05:07:14.948 --> 05:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
human services don't recommend you
 
05:07:16.868 --> 05:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
buying from this car
 
05:07:19.030 --> 05:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
so if i could add just one one more
 
05:07:20.948 --> 05:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
quick thing
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
every day
 
05:07:24.070 --> 05:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
we come to the hot dog cart with
 
05:07:27.190 --> 05:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
pre-cooked hot dogs okay
 
05:07:31.190 --> 05:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
and with those hot dogs we bring along
 
05:07:33.270 --> 05:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
washed sanitized
 
05:07:35.670 --> 05:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
tongs to pick them up
 
05:07:35.680 --> 05:07:38.550 align:start position:0%
tongs to pick them up
okay

05:07:38.550 --> 05:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:40.390 --> 05:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
any of what we're talking about here is
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
going to be treated exactly the same way
 
05:07:47.110 --> 05:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
because it's already all pre-cooked
 
05:07:49.510 --> 05:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
everything is going to get i clean the
 
05:07:51.670 --> 05:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
pans just like you see them
 
05:07:53.670 --> 05:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
every single day
 
05:07:54.948 --> 05:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:07:56.868 --> 05:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
if i had a grill
 
05:07:59.990 --> 05:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i had raw beef
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i was trying to cook those
 
05:08:04.470 --> 05:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
that is a different story i totally
 
05:08:06.070 --> 05:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
but everything on this cart
 
05:08:12.470 --> 05:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
is completely precooked
 
05:08:15.030 --> 05:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i'll leave it out there
 
05:08:16.788 --> 05:08:16.798 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
05:08:18.868 --> 05:08:18.878 align:start position:0%
so let me end this yes thank you for
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
letting me ask my question
 
05:08:23.270 --> 05:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
so you're telling me that
 
05:08:25.750 --> 05:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
the hot dogs that you
 
05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
sell in your hot dog stand
 
05:08:30.070 --> 05:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
are already pre-cooked when you bring
 
05:08:30.080 --> 05:08:31.110 align:start position:0%
are already pre-cooked when you bring
them

05:08:31.110 --> 05:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:08:33.190 --> 05:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
but you can't do the same thing with an
 
05:08:33.200 --> 05:08:34.230 align:start position:0%
but you can't do the same thing with an
onion

05:08:34.230 --> 05:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
onion
 
05:08:34.240 --> 05:08:35.270 align:start position:0%
onion
right

05:08:35.270 --> 05:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
that makes no sense
 
05:08:40.868 --> 05:08:40.878 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't want cooked onions i want
 
05:08:43.750 --> 05:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
raw onions
 
05:08:48.948 --> 05:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:52.150 --> 05:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
well thank you you know where this was
 
05:08:56.230 --> 05:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:59.830 --> 05:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
05:09:01.350 --> 05:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative you want to wrap this one
 
05:09:01.360 --> 05:09:03.830 align:start position:0%
representative you want to wrap this one
up

05:09:03.830 --> 05:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:06.150 --> 05:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the opportunity this
 
05:09:07.990 --> 05:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like the second bill
 
05:09:09.910 --> 05:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
that i might have screwed up
 
05:09:11.580 --> 05:09:11.590 align:start position:0%
in submitting
 
05:09:11.590 --> 05:09:13.750 align:start position:0%
in submitting
[Music]

05:09:13.750 --> 05:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:09:15.990 --> 05:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think the committee
 
05:09:17.270 --> 05:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
maybe should
 
05:09:20.150 --> 05:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
itl this if the department is going to
 
05:09:22.470 --> 05:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
make rules that are so cumbersome that
 
05:09:25.030 --> 05:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
it kills the hot dog industry
 
05:09:27.030 --> 05:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
and i have no control over it as you
 
05:09:29.190 --> 05:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
suggested mr chairman
 
05:09:29.200 --> 05:09:29.990 align:start position:0%
suggested mr chairman
so

05:09:29.990 --> 05:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:31.750 --> 05:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
we have a good relationship with the
 
05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
department we'll see if we can find
 
05:09:35.750 --> 05:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
find a way to
 
05:09:37.190 --> 05:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
get this to be
 
05:09:40.470 --> 05:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
palatable thank you very much
 
05:09:44.708 --> 05:09:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:48.310 --> 05:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
in our pre-cooked sausage okay um
 
05:09:50.310 --> 05:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
amber found a commissary
 
05:09:51.990 --> 05:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
05:09:55.270 --> 05:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
the the blue sheet we have one person uh
 
05:09:56.788 --> 05:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
zephan wood
 
05:09:59.270 --> 05:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
from pembroke new hampshire and
 
05:10:01.190 --> 05:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
is in support of the bill
 
05:10:03.030 --> 05:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
and well that will close the public
 
05:10:03.040 --> 05:10:09.750 align:start position:0%
and well that will close the public
hearing

05:10:09.750 --> 05:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:24.070 --> 05:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
oh no no no that's no then you click on
 
05:10:28.948 --> 05:10:28.958 align:start position:0%
something and they say oh no that's just
 
05:10:33.270 --> 05:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:36.868 --> 05:10:36.878 align:start position:0%
but there are actually
 
05:10:38.550 --> 05:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
this is better than a lot of other stuff
 
05:10:40.150 --> 05:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
that other committees do
 
05:10:41.510 --> 05:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
at least it's something new and
 
05:10:42.948 --> 05:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
different each day i'm learning about
 
05:10:45.590 --> 05:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
05:10:47.190 --> 05:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
before you open
 
05:10:48.868 --> 05:10:48.878 align:start position:0%
i mean that's it here i mean look at
 
05:10:52.470 --> 05:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
this thing i mean it's enclosed and
 
05:10:54.550 --> 05:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
if you're going to do it that that gets
 
05:10:56.390 --> 05:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
you around a lot of the stuff well you
 
05:10:57.910 --> 05:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
know what it is
 
05:11:00.310 --> 05:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
the prebase thing needs to be deep
 
05:11:04.150 --> 05:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
enough to wash that chili pot and if
 
05:11:06.470 --> 05:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's not you can't serve chicken
 
05:11:07.990 --> 05:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's all about this thing but this would
 
05:11:22.390 --> 05:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:24.390 --> 05:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
05:11:26.150 --> 05:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
i may not know too much about bitcoin
 
05:11:37.350 --> 05:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:37.360 --> 05:11:47.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:11:47.430 --> 05:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:47.440 --> 05:12:13.510 align:start position:0%

05:12:22.948 --> 05:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:22.958 --> 05:12:40.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:20:04.470 --> 05:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
probably before then to
 
05:20:06.550 --> 05:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
numerous complaints from local small
 
05:20:08.708 --> 05:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
businesses regarding food safety rules
 
05:20:10.788 --> 05:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
that they must adhere to
 
05:20:13.030 --> 05:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
the rules can be as you've heard in
 
05:20:15.350 --> 05:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
previous testimony the rules have been
 
05:20:17.110 --> 05:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
can be confusing
 
05:20:19.990 --> 05:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
illogical and sometimes costly to our
 
05:20:20.000 --> 05:20:21.750 align:start position:0%
illogical and sometimes costly to our
constituents

05:20:21.750 --> 05:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
05:20:23.750 --> 05:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
i feel that it's necessary that we take
 
05:20:25.910 --> 05:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
a deep dive into these issues facing our
 
05:20:28.708 --> 05:20:28.718 align:start position:0%
small businesses that sell food
 
05:20:31.750 --> 05:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
so this study committee should study
 
05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
number one state and local regulations
 
05:20:36.150 --> 05:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
including food licensing and food safety
 
05:20:37.910 --> 05:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
rules applicable to small businesses
 
05:20:39.670 --> 05:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
that sell food
 
05:20:41.670 --> 05:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
number two the problems caused by the
 
05:20:43.510 --> 05:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
current food safety rules for small
 
05:20:43.520 --> 05:20:44.708 align:start position:0%
current food safety rules for small
businesses

05:20:44.708 --> 05:20:44.718 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
05:20:46.470 --> 05:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
and number three whether food safety
 
05:20:49.270 --> 05:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
rules can be simplified and or modified
 
05:20:51.670 --> 05:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
for small businesses that sell food
 
05:20:53.110 --> 05:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
and number four
 
05:20:55.350 --> 05:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
to identify what future legislative
 
05:20:57.590 --> 05:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
actions if any are necessary to address
 
05:21:00.070 --> 05:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
the problems faced by small businesses
 
05:21:02.390 --> 05:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
that sell food in order to comply with
 
05:21:04.070 --> 05:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
current state and local
 
05:21:04.080 --> 05:21:05.430 align:start position:0%
current state and local
requirements

05:21:05.430 --> 05:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:21:07.110 --> 05:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
and i believe there's federal
 
05:21:11.270 --> 05:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:14.150 --> 05:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
but anyway here are a few examples of
 
05:21:16.470 --> 05:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
what people have told me about the rules
 
05:21:18.470 --> 05:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
they must follow so
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
and and for sure these businessmen don't
 
05:21:23.590 --> 05:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
want to poison their customers
 
05:21:25.830 --> 05:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
they are very careful and conscientious
 
05:21:27.990 --> 05:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
they want to do the right thing they
 
05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
want to make sure their food that
 
05:21:31.350 --> 05:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
they're selling is safe
 
05:21:33.510 --> 05:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
but sometimes these food safety rules
 
05:21:37.430 --> 05:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
simply don't make any sense
 
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
so for instance i
 
05:21:43.110 --> 05:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
did know of i did meet a hot dog vendor
 
05:21:44.868 --> 05:21:44.878 align:start position:0%
this past summer and she complained to
 
05:21:44.878 --> 05:21:45.590 align:start position:0%
this past summer and she complained to
me

05:21:45.590 --> 05:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:21:48.230 --> 05:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
again that she could put jarred cut up
 
05:21:50.788 --> 05:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
onions here we go with the onions
 
05:21:53.110 --> 05:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
on her customers hot dog but if she cut
 
05:21:55.510 --> 05:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
up an onion herself on the food prep
 
05:21:57.750 --> 05:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
area of her cart
 
05:22:00.070 --> 05:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
which she keeps spotless
 
05:22:01.990 --> 05:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
then she would be required to have a
 
05:22:04.230 --> 05:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
restaurant license
 
05:22:06.788 --> 05:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
and a restaurant license is also as we
 
05:22:10.628 --> 05:22:10.638 align:start position:0%
all know an involved and costly endeavor
 
05:22:12.548 --> 05:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
i know another business that has a food
 
05:22:12.558 --> 05:22:13.990 align:start position:0%
i know another business that has a food
truck

05:22:13.990 --> 05:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
truck
 
05:22:16.230 --> 05:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
they were unable to hook up a food grade
 
05:22:19.270 --> 05:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
hose to a clean drinking water source
 
05:22:21.910 --> 05:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
from a store structure
 
05:22:25.510 --> 05:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
at allison's in walpole and instead
 
05:22:27.590 --> 05:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
they were told they could only use water
 
05:22:30.150 --> 05:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
from containers in their own food truck
 
05:22:32.390 --> 05:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
trucking around their own water was dick
 
05:22:35.510 --> 05:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
ridiculous it took up very valuable
 
05:22:37.910 --> 05:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
space in their food truck and restricted
 
05:22:39.350 --> 05:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
their water use
 
05:22:41.750 --> 05:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the water would have been just as
 
05:22:43.750 --> 05:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
safe and drinkable from their hose
 
05:22:43.760 --> 05:22:45.830 align:start position:0%
safe and drinkable from their hose
hookup

05:22:45.830 --> 05:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
hookup
 
05:22:48.868 --> 05:22:48.878 align:start position:0%
another constituent who's a dairy farmer
 
05:22:50.070 --> 05:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
said to me
 
05:22:51.510 --> 05:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to get a small
 
05:22:53.750 --> 05:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
pasteurizer and pasteurize their milk
 
05:22:56.548 --> 05:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
and make butter soft soft cheeses
 
05:22:59.750 --> 05:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
puddings yogurt kefir and creams
 
05:23:01.190 --> 05:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
and they were told they needed a
 
05:23:03.510 --> 05:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
commercial chick kitchen with a three
 
05:23:05.590 --> 05:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
basin to do that
 
05:23:07.990 --> 05:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
but yet if they had a homestead license
 
05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
they could do that without a three base
 
05:23:09.840 --> 05:23:10.948 align:start position:0%
they could do that without a three base
sink

05:23:10.948 --> 05:23:10.958 align:start position:0%
sink
 
05:23:14.948 --> 05:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
people are not allowed to put a
 
05:23:17.750 --> 05:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen in their home at
 
05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
least that's what i'm told
 
05:23:21.430 --> 05:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
yet you can still bake things in your
 
05:23:23.510 --> 05:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
regular kitchen and label it exempt from
 
05:23:27.030 --> 05:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire licenses
 
05:23:28.868 --> 05:23:28.878 align:start position:0%
i'm also going to note that some people
 
05:23:31.910 --> 05:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
told me today that they couldn't come
 
05:23:34.708 --> 05:23:34.718 align:start position:0%
today or they wouldn't come today
 
05:23:36.788 --> 05:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
because to testify because they were
 
05:23:36.798 --> 05:23:38.150 align:start position:0%
because to testify because they were
afraid

05:23:38.150 --> 05:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
afraid
 
05:23:40.548 --> 05:23:40.558 align:start position:0%
to come and testify for fear of reprisal
 
05:23:42.548 --> 05:23:42.558 align:start position:0%
from state agencies
 
05:23:44.548 --> 05:23:44.558 align:start position:0%
and i'd say that's indicative of a
 
05:23:44.558 --> 05:23:45.670 align:start position:0%
and i'd say that's indicative of a
problem

05:23:45.670 --> 05:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:23:47.510 --> 05:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
people didn't want to come here and then
 
05:23:49.590 --> 05:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
say something and then have an inspector
 
05:23:53.590 --> 05:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:55.830 --> 05:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
so i believe this study bill is one
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's really needed
 
05:24:00.548 --> 05:24:00.558 align:start position:0%
we really should as a legislature take a
 
05:24:03.270 --> 05:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
good hard look at these rules and see
 
05:24:06.830 --> 05:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
where some can be eliminated simplified
 
05:24:06.840 --> 05:24:08.470 align:start position:0%
where some can be eliminated simplified
clarified

05:24:08.470 --> 05:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
05:24:11.510 --> 05:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
and just basically taken a look at for
 
05:24:13.750 --> 05:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
our small businesses
 
05:24:17.110 --> 05:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
i'm told that some of these rules even
 
05:24:19.030 --> 05:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
will make people abandon their dreams of
 
05:24:21.270 --> 05:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
starting a business because they end up
 
05:24:23.830 --> 05:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
being so costly to implement
 
05:24:25.510 --> 05:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
and i hope that you'll pass this bill
 
05:24:27.030 --> 05:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
out of your committee with an otp
 
05:24:28.788 --> 05:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
recommendation and start the process of
 
05:24:31.030 --> 05:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
really looking at what we're asking
 
05:24:33.110 --> 05:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
are small businesses that sell food or
 
05:24:35.190 --> 05:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
want to sell food what they should
 
05:24:37.670 --> 05:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know how they should do things
 
05:24:37.680 --> 05:24:39.190 align:start position:0%
you know how they should do things
um

05:24:39.190 --> 05:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:41.190 --> 05:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
i mean given the testimony that we heard
 
05:24:41.200 --> 05:24:43.670 align:start position:0%
i mean given the testimony that we heard
earlier

05:24:43.670 --> 05:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
05:24:45.270 --> 05:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
it it just
 
05:24:45.280 --> 05:24:46.948 align:start position:0%
it it just
really

05:24:46.948 --> 05:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:24:46.958 --> 05:24:48.230 align:start position:0%
really
underscores

05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
underscores
 
05:24:52.150 --> 05:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
the reason the the the idea that
 
05:24:53.670 --> 05:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
there are some things that don't seem to
 
05:24:55.830 --> 05:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
make sense and some things that we
 
05:24:57.270 --> 05:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
really need to
 
05:24:59.110 --> 05:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
take a look at and see
 
05:25:00.548 --> 05:25:00.558 align:start position:0%
how people are doing it why they're
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
doing it why the state is requesting
 
05:25:03.430 --> 05:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
them to do it
 
05:25:04.948 --> 05:25:04.958 align:start position:0%
i mean there may be very very good
 
05:25:08.150 --> 05:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
reasons why things are being done or
 
05:25:10.628 --> 05:25:10.638 align:start position:0%
asked to be done a certain way
 
05:25:12.868 --> 05:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
but i think we really need need to take
 
05:25:15.110 --> 05:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
a look and and see what the differences
 
05:25:15.120 --> 05:25:17.110 align:start position:0%
a look and and see what the differences
are

05:25:17.110 --> 05:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:25:19.430 --> 05:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
between these different licenses
 
05:25:19.440 --> 05:25:20.230 align:start position:0%
between these different licenses
and

05:25:20.230 --> 05:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:22.948 --> 05:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
how people are are being
 
05:25:25.430 --> 05:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
asked to adhere to these rules
 
05:25:25.440 --> 05:25:26.868 align:start position:0%
asked to adhere to these rules
so

05:25:26.868 --> 05:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:25:29.270 --> 05:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
with that i'd be happy to take any
 
05:25:29.280 --> 05:25:34.708 align:start position:0%
with that i'd be happy to take any
questions

05:25:34.708 --> 05:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:34.718 --> 05:25:35.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:25:35.910 --> 05:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:25:37.510 --> 05:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:25:39.270 --> 05:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
my question judy
 
05:25:42.948 --> 05:25:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh representative um i love this bill
 
05:25:44.548 --> 05:25:44.558 align:start position:0%
i think we can get get rid of the other
 
05:25:46.470 --> 05:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
two bills
 
05:25:48.310 --> 05:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
because this is exactly what we need to
 
05:25:48.320 --> 05:25:49.110 align:start position:0%
because this is exactly what we need to
do

05:25:49.110 --> 05:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:25:49.120 --> 05:25:50.150 align:start position:0%
do
um

05:25:50.150 --> 05:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:51.990 --> 05:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
would you believe but i also wanted to
 
05:25:53.990 --> 05:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
mention that
 
05:25:56.310 --> 05:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
study committees i mean
 
05:25:58.788 --> 05:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
the your side of the aisle does not want
 
05:26:00.708 --> 05:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
study committees so why are you
 
05:26:03.030 --> 05:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
presenting a bill for a study committee
 
05:26:04.628 --> 05:26:04.638 align:start position:0%
i like the idea but
 
05:26:06.948 --> 05:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
yeah well you know i think sometimes
 
05:26:08.948 --> 05:26:08.958 align:start position:0%
study committees are really warranted we
 
05:26:11.270 --> 05:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
have to do them i think we have to you
 
05:26:11.280 --> 05:26:12.310 align:start position:0%
have to do them i think we have to you
know

05:26:12.310 --> 05:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
take a deep dive into what we are what
 
05:26:16.868 --> 05:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
we have put in place
 
05:26:19.190 --> 05:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
in the in the statutes
 
05:26:21.430 --> 05:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:26:23.510 --> 05:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
just step back and take a look and see
 
05:26:26.788 --> 05:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
how how these are working or not working
 
05:26:29.430 --> 05:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
i mean the fact that we only have 30
 
05:26:32.548 --> 05:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
vendors or street hot dog vendors or
 
05:26:34.548 --> 05:26:34.558 align:start position:0%
whatever the cart vendors are in the
 
05:26:36.948 --> 05:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
whole entire state of new hampshire
 
05:26:36.958 --> 05:26:37.910 align:start position:0%
whole entire state of new hampshire
that

05:26:37.910 --> 05:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:26:40.470 --> 05:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
that points to me that there is an issue
 
05:26:45.030 --> 05:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:47.590 --> 05:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
well maybe the rules
 
05:26:50.070 --> 05:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
are cost prohibitive i don't know i mean
 
05:26:53.670 --> 05:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:55.110 --> 05:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:57.430 --> 05:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
barlett thank you mr chair
 
05:27:00.390 --> 05:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
um so you want to take a deep dive and
 
05:27:03.030 --> 05:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
so if this gets passed through the house
 
05:27:05.430 --> 05:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
by the end of february then it goes to
 
05:27:06.948 --> 05:27:06.958 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
05:27:08.948 --> 05:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
gets passed to the senate sometime in
 
05:27:11.430 --> 05:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
april you only have five people doing
 
05:27:12.868 --> 05:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
this and it only applies to small
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
businesses but there's no definition of
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
what a small business is
 
05:27:17.280 --> 05:27:18.548 align:start position:0%
what a small business is
okay

05:27:18.548 --> 05:27:18.558 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:27:19.830 --> 05:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
and you want to
 
05:27:21.910 --> 05:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
you want to address everything from
 
05:27:24.628 --> 05:27:24.638 align:start position:0%
poultry to dairy to
 
05:27:27.110 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
food prep
 
05:27:29.430 --> 05:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
and and you want to get this all out of
 
05:27:31.270 --> 05:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
committee during a campaign year i mean
 
05:27:33.670 --> 05:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
is this really realistic to be able to
 
05:27:33.680 --> 05:27:34.548 align:start position:0%
is this really realistic to be able to
get

05:27:34.548 --> 05:27:34.558 align:start position:0%
get
 
05:27:36.830 --> 05:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
a study committee
 
05:27:41.110 --> 05:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
out with that kind of a time frame
 
05:27:43.430 --> 05:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
i think if there's a will we can do it
 
05:27:45.270 --> 05:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
05:27:47.830 --> 05:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's certainly a
 
05:27:50.868 --> 05:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:53.350 --> 05:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
involved here but um i think it's
 
05:27:55.430 --> 05:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
important enough
 
05:27:57.350 --> 05:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
for our constituents and for our small
 
05:28:00.230 --> 05:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
businesses to do this
 
05:28:03.350 --> 05:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
if people feel that perhaps this is not
 
05:28:05.750 --> 05:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
a year to do it because you know you
 
05:28:07.030 --> 05:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:28:09.830 --> 05:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
go off and do some campaigning instead i
 
05:28:12.150 --> 05:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
i would prefer to do something of
 
05:28:12.160 --> 05:28:14.390 align:start position:0%
i would prefer to do something of
meaningful

05:28:14.390 --> 05:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
05:28:17.910 --> 05:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
work to help our constituents
 
05:28:20.150 --> 05:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
and i think this this study committee is
 
05:28:20.160 --> 05:28:26.548 align:start position:0%
and i think this this study committee is
needed

05:28:26.548 --> 05:28:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:26.558 --> 05:28:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:28:30.548 --> 05:28:30.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:37.510 --> 05:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
oh i would like to add one other point
 
05:28:37.520 --> 05:28:38.948 align:start position:0%
oh i would like to add one other point
too

05:28:38.948 --> 05:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
too
 
05:28:41.750 --> 05:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
i know that a
 
05:28:41.760 --> 05:28:42.708 align:start position:0%
i know that a
letter

05:28:42.708 --> 05:28:42.718 align:start position:0%
letter
 
05:28:45.270 --> 05:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
was sent from new hampshire department
 
05:28:47.750 --> 05:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
of environmental services
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
concerning this bill
 
05:28:52.150 --> 05:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
and in this
 
05:28:54.708 --> 05:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
letter to you it they had said that they
 
05:28:56.230 --> 05:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
believed that this bill was related to
 
05:28:58.708 --> 05:28:58.718 align:start position:0%
another bill that i had submitted
 
05:29:00.708 --> 05:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
having to do with
 
05:29:02.628 --> 05:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
plumbing issues and sewage and things
 
05:29:03.910 --> 05:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
like that
 
05:29:06.788 --> 05:29:06.798 align:start position:0%
and it's not this is not related to hbe
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
1312. i don't want to talk about another
 
05:29:10.070 --> 05:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
bill right now
 
05:29:12.948 --> 05:29:12.958 align:start position:0%
and conflate them but it is it does not
 
05:29:14.470 --> 05:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with that bill
 
05:29:16.150 --> 05:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
they're watching you
 
05:29:18.548 --> 05:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to make that clear i
 
05:29:21.270 --> 05:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
simply want to take a look at these uh
 
05:29:21.280 --> 05:29:22.470 align:start position:0%
simply want to take a look at these uh
rules

05:29:22.470 --> 05:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:29:25.590 --> 05:29:25.600 align:start position:0%

and
 
05:30:38.230 --> 05:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
part of that program is the subsurface
 
05:30:40.150 --> 05:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
systems bureau which deals with septic
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:43.200 --> 05:30:44.070 align:start position:0%

so i'm here today to testify in support
 
05:30:47.110 --> 05:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
05:30:48.868 --> 05:30:48.878 align:start position:0%
the bill seeks
 
05:30:50.230 --> 05:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
to have a study committee related to
 
05:30:53.590 --> 05:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
food safety and licensing regulations
 
05:30:55.990 --> 05:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
des is mentioned in the bill
 
05:30:58.390 --> 05:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
because some of the des regulations
 
05:31:00.230 --> 05:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
related to
 
05:31:02.708 --> 05:31:02.718 align:start position:0%
septic systems and water supply are
 
05:31:06.030 --> 05:31:06.040 align:start position:0%
cross-referenced in the food safety
 
05:31:08.708 --> 05:31:08.718 align:start position:0%
regulations um the department would be
 
05:31:10.070 --> 05:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
happy to participate in the study
 
05:31:12.230 --> 05:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
committee uh we recognize that these
 
05:31:14.548 --> 05:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
things are complicated and we are always
 
05:31:15.910 --> 05:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
looking for ways to streamline and
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
modernize regulations and reduce the
 
05:31:20.628 --> 05:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden on our
 
05:31:23.350 --> 05:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
on the people of the state
 
05:31:25.750 --> 05:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
and as representative erin mentioned uh
 
05:31:28.150 --> 05:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
in our in our letter we did a cross
 
05:31:30.788 --> 05:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
reference to house bill 1312 which is
 
05:31:31.990 --> 05:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
related to
 
05:31:34.470 --> 05:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
plumbing code issues i understand her
 
05:31:36.548 --> 05:31:36.558 align:start position:0%
point uh directly that she wants this
 
05:31:39.670 --> 05:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
bill to be focused on food safety
 
05:31:41.350 --> 05:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
because of the cross referencing that we
 
05:31:41.360 --> 05:31:42.230 align:start position:0%
because of the cross referencing that we
have

05:31:42.230 --> 05:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:31:44.868 --> 05:31:44.878 align:start position:0%
we it pulls in some of our regulations
 
05:31:47.990 --> 05:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
related to water supply and wastewater
 
05:31:50.470 --> 05:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
so it might be appropriate to
 
05:31:52.150 --> 05:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
if you really want this just to focus on
 
05:31:54.150 --> 05:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
food safety we might have to
 
05:31:55.990 --> 05:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
say something to exempt these other
 
05:31:57.990 --> 05:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
aspects related to food service
 
05:31:58.000 --> 05:32:00.948 align:start position:0%
aspects related to food service
licensing

05:32:00.948 --> 05:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:02.788 --> 05:32:02.798 align:start position:0%
so you know with that i mean i just want
 
05:32:03.990 --> 05:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
to thank you all for the opportunity to
 
05:32:05.830 --> 05:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
testify and i'm happy to take any
 
05:32:05.840 --> 05:32:11.270 align:start position:0%
testify and i'm happy to take any
questions

05:32:11.270 --> 05:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:14.070 --> 05:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh just for a lark um
 
05:32:15.990 --> 05:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
grease when they're when they under the
 
05:32:18.390 --> 05:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
oil when they did the for the fryers
 
05:32:18.400 --> 05:32:19.350 align:start position:0%
oil when they did the for the fryers
yeah

05:32:19.350 --> 05:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:32:19.360 --> 05:32:20.390 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

05:32:20.390 --> 05:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:32:21.830 --> 05:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
i assume
 
05:32:23.270 --> 05:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
somebody needs to come and take it away
 
05:32:25.270 --> 05:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
that you can't dump it into your septic
 
05:32:28.628 --> 05:32:28.638 align:start position:0%
system and yes so do you regulate that
 
05:32:30.470 --> 05:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
those operator or whatever what happened
 
05:32:33.270 --> 05:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
at disposal of that that grease
 
05:32:36.230 --> 05:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
yes we have regulations on that for sure
 
05:32:39.190 --> 05:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's a got a couple of issues
 
05:32:41.910 --> 05:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
because um the like the requirements are
 
05:32:41.920 --> 05:32:42.788 align:start position:0%
because um the like the requirements are
to

05:32:42.788 --> 05:32:42.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:32:44.470 --> 05:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
to remove the grease you can't pour it
 
05:32:46.310 --> 05:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
down the drain and if you're yeah for us
 
05:32:48.628 --> 05:32:48.638 align:start position:0%
when dealing with septic systems the
 
05:32:50.150 --> 05:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
increased interceptors are there to
 
05:32:52.708 --> 05:32:52.718 align:start position:0%
protect the septic system from being
 
05:32:55.190 --> 05:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
basically just you know
 
05:32:57.030 --> 05:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
becoming effective and then there's a
 
05:32:59.910 --> 05:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
secondary issue that if the septage
 
05:33:01.670 --> 05:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's caught in a septic tank is
 
05:33:03.750 --> 05:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
becomes contaminated with grease
 
05:33:06.628 --> 05:33:06.638 align:start position:0%
then the septage haulers are taking this
 
05:33:08.548 --> 05:33:08.558 align:start position:0%
material to a wastewater treatment plant
 
05:33:10.548 --> 05:33:10.558 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the plant won't accept it
 
05:33:11.750 --> 05:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
yeah they're awful
 
05:33:13.190 --> 05:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
and or
 
05:33:14.868 --> 05:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
you know if the plant does accept it it
 
05:33:16.868 --> 05:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
can foul the plant so there's a lot of
 
05:33:18.708 --> 05:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
good reasons to manage grease well and
 
05:33:20.310 --> 05:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
there's some great uh best management
 
05:33:22.548 --> 05:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
practices on that that businesses can
 
05:33:22.558 --> 05:33:23.510 align:start position:0%
practices on that that businesses can
follow

05:33:23.510 --> 05:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
follow
 
05:33:26.150 --> 05:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's complicated but there there's
 
05:33:27.670 --> 05:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
regular people out there that come and
 
05:33:30.150 --> 05:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
take this from restaurants and yeah
 
05:33:30.160 --> 05:33:31.430 align:start position:0%
take this from restaurants and yeah
absolutely

05:33:31.430 --> 05:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
05:33:32.948 --> 05:33:32.958 align:start position:0%
right they burn it right you can they
 
05:33:34.868 --> 05:33:34.878 align:start position:0%
don't they burn it to make energy out of
 
05:33:36.788 --> 05:33:36.798 align:start position:0%
it yeah there's one company that accepts
 
05:33:38.470 --> 05:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
it for biodiesel
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
biodiesel yeah cool yeah
 
05:33:42.788 --> 05:33:42.798 align:start position:0%
so yeah there's definitely markets for
 
05:33:44.548 --> 05:33:44.558 align:start position:0%
it and so there's a process but you know
 
05:33:45.590 --> 05:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's this is we're kind of getting
 
05:33:48.788 --> 05:33:48.798 align:start position:0%
into the material for house bill 1312
 
05:33:48.798 --> 05:33:50.390 align:start position:0%
into the material for house bill 1312
right

05:33:50.390 --> 05:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:33:50.400 --> 05:33:51.190 align:start position:0%
right
and

05:33:51.190 --> 05:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:52.868 --> 05:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
we just if there's going to be a study
 
05:33:55.510 --> 05:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
committee um and it's covering some of
 
05:33:56.948 --> 05:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
these complicated issues we just think
 
05:33:59.510 --> 05:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
maybe these two committees could or we
 
05:34:01.830 --> 05:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
will not be doing this now yeah then
 
05:34:03.910 --> 05:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
05:34:05.990 --> 05:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
all right we if you were here earlier
 
05:34:07.430 --> 05:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
you can see we have got our hands full
 
05:34:10.070 --> 05:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
with just the two that we well two known
 
05:34:11.670 --> 05:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
problems we really got
 
05:34:13.270 --> 05:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
before we could start looking for
 
05:34:15.270 --> 05:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
looking for problems so i i have to say
 
05:34:16.628 --> 05:34:16.638 align:start position:0%

chrissy you might want to hear this one
 
05:35:27.670 --> 05:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
because 1502 that we have removed
 
05:35:28.948 --> 05:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:35:30.788 --> 05:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
the separate division
 
05:35:33.270 --> 05:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
the speaker has waived us sending it to
 
05:35:35.750 --> 05:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
a second committee so we don't have to
 
05:35:37.990 --> 05:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
do crypto too quickly
 
05:35:45.510 --> 05:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:54.070 --> 05:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:12.708 --> 05:36:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:12.718 --> 05:36:16.230 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:36:16.230 --> 05:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:18.470 --> 05:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
we want to take away the argument that
 
05:36:22.310 --> 05:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of this is moving too fast
 
05:36:23.510 --> 05:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
05:36:25.190 --> 05:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm intending on putting in an
 
05:36:27.350 --> 05:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill okay so that it
 
05:36:30.470 --> 05:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
limits it to food trucks carts homestead
 
05:36:32.548 --> 05:36:32.558 align:start position:0%
but we're already doing those issues now
 
05:36:34.230 --> 05:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
we already have two bills of doing that
 
05:36:34.240 --> 05:36:35.270 align:start position:0%
we already have two bills of doing that
yeah

05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:36:37.030 --> 05:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
okay we're already doing it
 
05:36:38.548 --> 05:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
no we don't need to say we know what the
 
05:36:40.948 --> 05:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
problems are we just spent an hour
 
05:36:42.948 --> 05:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
and a half learning with the problem
