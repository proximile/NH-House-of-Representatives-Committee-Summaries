00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
Henry thank you
 
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to invite representative
 
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
margerie Smith to the table and just
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you very much um Madam
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
chair um and I have to begin by being
 
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
quite honest about the fact that I have
 
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
a bias my bias is that I think that the
 
00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
office of the LBA is the Crown
 
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
Jewel in
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh when we look at all of those people
 
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
who assist the legislature in doing its
 
00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
work mostly we think of the LBA in terms
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
of budget but we also have to think
 
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
about the LBA in terms of financial
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
auditing and performance auditing I
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
happen to think that
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
although I'm sorry to say that most
 
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
legislators do not know or pay any
 
00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
attention to the work of the performance
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
audits they are the most
 
00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 align:start position:0%
important uh operation that we have in
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
terms of us being able to
 
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
know what we as the legislature have
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
done well and not done well in
 
00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
creating uh all kinds of entities in the
 
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
government and also how those entities
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
are performing it is now going to be
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
three terms ago that questions arose
 
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
about the work of the Human Rights
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
Commission they were not following the
 
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
rules they were not following the law it
 
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
was documented again and again and
 
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
again and we came the Judiciary
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
Committee asked for an audit it took up
 
00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:04.759 align:start position:0%
quite a while for that to get started it
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
was delayed again and again and again
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
because the head was not able to do the
 
00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:12.759 align:start position:0%
work that was
 
00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
required um now today uh I I've just
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
heard for the first time that there are
 
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.869 align:start position:0%
heard for the first time that there are
actual

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 align:start position:0%
actual
 
00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:26.879 align:start position:0%
dates my and if for finishing the
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
process if those dates are are in fact
 
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
honored it it's a long time coming and I
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
would be really delighted but I would
 
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:40.879 align:start position:0%
like to say to those of you who are on
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
the committee now and who may or may not
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
be on the committee um in the new uh
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
legislative term but who will certainly
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
have records to pass on that if they
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
continues to be the
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
delay um that we have experienced month
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
after month after month something has to
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
be done to stop that delay and to tell
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
the human rights committee that it is
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
time to follow the law um I I know that
 
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.469 align:start position:0%
time to follow the law um I I know that
sounds

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
sounds
 
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
harsh uh and it is harsh but it's harsh
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
because um there are people out there
 
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
literally whose lives depend upon the
 
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
work of the human Rights Commission I of
 
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
course am not privy nor should I be
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
privy to any of the findings of the of
 
00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:41.959 align:start position:0%
the uh the LBA performance staff but I
 
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
would be very surprised if they did not
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
find that I'm correct in the statements
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
that I made about the unconscionable
 
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
delays that have gone on and
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
whether subsequent action is taken by
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
this body or another body um this to me
 
00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:05.959 align:start position:0%
represents uh the nadier the worst of
 
00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
what has happened in state government in
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
terms of our paying attention to what we
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
do it's all well and good for us to
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
create a body to solve the problems of
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the state but if we
 
00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
don't pay attention to whether that is
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
what's happening then I think we are
 
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
found wanting and Madam chair I thank
 
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
you very much for letting me um vent my
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
spleen in this but I do think that it is
 
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
of concern and should be of concern to
 
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.069 align:start position:0%
of concern and should be of concern to
every

00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
legislator thank you thank you for that
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
input any questions
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
Smith no thank you thank you very much
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
tomorrow Madam chair I would have a
 
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
question of LBA regarding that issue oh
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
back so just curious about sort of the
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
protocol because it sounds like the
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
delay really is because there was
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
inconsistency with the executive
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
director on leave so I'm wondering if
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
there was any less Lessons Learned or
 
00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
any protocol sort of developed for um
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're still able to do
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
what we need to do uh and you are able
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
to do what you to do when there is a
 
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
that thank you um this is definitely an
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
unusual situation um usually if the head
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
of a department leaves then you have the
 
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
next person uh on the list that will
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
move up and uh will be able to deal with
 
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
the audit but um in this case um we had
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
the um assistant executive director also
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
um not available uh left the commission
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
so then um the attorney at the
 
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice had to step in and
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
uh sort of take over and start helping
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
out with the audit um the Human Rights
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
Commission is administratively attached
 
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Justice so um you
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
know we're lucky in that sense that
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
there was somebody there that that could
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh help us out with the audit and help
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
us try to finish it up but um this is
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
not a typical situation um so we're kind
 
00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:42.279 align:start position:0%
of in uncharted waters here and just
 
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
doing the best that we can to to work
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
with the attorney at the Department of
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
Justice to to um you know help us with
 
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
finishing up the report and get the
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
audity responses so that we can get this
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
any further questions on this audit well
 
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
we'll look forward to
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
so okay shall I move on to the state
 
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
oversight of special
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
education um the audit is currently
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
staffed with four Auditors uh field work
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
is expected to conclude this month we
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
continue to draft observations for the
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh completed portions of our work and as
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
I reported the last time that we met uh
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
five observations have already been sent
 
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839 align:start position:0%
to the department and we have another
 
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
five observations that are in the final
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
stages of the review process and those
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
should be delivered to the department
 
00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:48.350 align:start position:0%
should be delivered to the department
this

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
month more observations are expected to
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
be delivered in January and a full draft
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
report is expected to be completed in
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
is this the H you told us would have 40
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
or 50 observations and be like yes the
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
collected works of Charles thingss yes
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
this one will be a lengthy
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
report so um last last meeting I think
 
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.069 align:start position:0%
report so um last last meeting I think
you

00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
said early spring of
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
2025 now I'm hearing mid mid 2025 yeah
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
what what is the reason for and it's
 
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
just you know delays include um you know
 
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's a very broad audit scope that we've
 
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
explained before the the the topic
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
matter is complex um we've had many um
 
00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
requests for information that we've sent
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
out and there is a massive volume of
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
data that um we are looking at to
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
complete the audit um we've had to have
 
00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:55.959 align:start position:0%
several follow-ups on our requests for
 
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
information we're continuing to work
 
00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
with the Department and um they're
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
providing us the information that we
 
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
need um so it's takes a long time um
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
they have another person that is out on
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
leave currently so we're not sure how
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
that will impact our timeline but we're
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
hoping that it's not not going to impact
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
it too much because we are expecting to
 
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
finish up fieldwork this month and then
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
it's the observation writing process
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
that we will continue to do and it
 
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
you okay I'll move on to the education
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
Freedom account
 
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
program the audit is currently staffed
 
00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:46.519 align:start position:0%
with three Auditors uh the team finished
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
its risk assessment and uh they're
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
finalizing their audit plan now uh field
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
work is starting and um we uh were
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
informed that the education Freedom
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
account administrator is resigning from
 
00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
his position there and uh his last day
 
00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
was November
 
00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
25th um he was the one staff member that
 
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
was responsible for oversight of the
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
contractor the children's scholarship
 
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
fund uh so it's unclear how this vacancy
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
will affect the audit um we're not sure
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
how it will impact the audit
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
timeline um and if you recall in our
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
scope statement we anticipated
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
presenting our audit report to the
 
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee sometime in the spring
 
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.069 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee sometime in the spring
of

00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
2025 uh we're still hopeful for that but
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
we'll see based on the the new vacancy
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
that we have there now so do we know
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
who's going to take the place of that
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
individual in terms of this audit I
 
00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a replacement yet we
 
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
haven't been uh informed of a
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.230 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
okay okay so we'll move on to the
 
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.069 align:start position:0%
okay okay so we'll move on to the
doorway

00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:11.079 align:start position:0%

23 in September also on page five we
 
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
talk about a earlier program evaluation
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
in September 2023 the Pacific Health
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
policy group was contracted to conduct a
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
program evaluation of the doorway
 
00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:28.039 align:start position:0%
program using data primarily from
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%

sustainability um we will Design the
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
audit to answer the following question
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
did the division of Behavioral Health
 
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
effectively monitor the provision of the
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
doorway program during State fisol years
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
2022 through
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
2024 our objectives will be to determine
 
00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
the number of citizens directly
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
participating in the program determine
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
how long it takes for them to access
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
services and evaluate the division's

00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
program we anticipate the pro uh
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
completing the audit and presenting to
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
the final the final report to the fiscal
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
committee and calendar year
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
2025 I'd be happy to take any questions
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
you may have resentative
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you so much for all of that
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you again um I was just
 
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
curious looking at the program metrics
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
that you were looking at and also
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
somewhat the recommendations of the
 
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
earlier program
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation is there anything that tells
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
us anything about the outcomes for
 
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
people that use the program I mean I I
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
see that we're doing a lot of
 
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
things uh the question I would have and
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how you would evaluate it
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
but if there was any way of telling I
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
would love to know is is this making a
 
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
difference is this I mean it's $76
 
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
million and are
 
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.990 align:start position:0%
million and are
[Music]

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
people I mean you know there's stuff
 
00:21:20.669 --> 00:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
about wait times to access service but
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
are people actually getting the services
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
they need and is it helping in their
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
recovery is really
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
what the nub would be for
 
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
me uh thank you for the question
 
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
um it's a difficult area to assess the
 
00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.669 align:start position:0%
um it's a difficult area to assess the
outcomes

00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
um it's something we hope we can get to
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh but I'm not sure that there's going
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
to be data for it uh we're going to do
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
as much as we can to come up with those
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
outcomes um my understanding is the
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
department now has um surveys that
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
they're using for determining outcomes
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh but we haven't seen them so I can't
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
really speak to um what they say or
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
anything like that Jennifer Saven from
 
00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
the um department is
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
here and perhaps can elucidate on your
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
question if you yeah um there are no
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
other seats at the table so Mr clinch
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
will just oh there is one actually okay
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
20 yeah come on over
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
next thank you madam chair members of
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Sabin I work at the Department
 
00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services and the
 
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health and I
 
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
oversee the state's opioid response um
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
so in the previous evaluation there was
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
a small cohort of could you speak more
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
in directly sure there was a small
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
outcomes cohort of Medicaid
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries um that was evaluated
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
small meaning a 200 so when you're
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
looking at the bigger numbers of
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
everyone impacted um but to John's Point
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
who is moving through the system who's
 
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
accessing care and what their outcomes
 
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
are is hard to determine however with
 
00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:12.039 align:start position:0%
that small group of people we were able
 
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
to answer your question which is a
 
00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
question I ask a lot which is is anybody
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
better off right it's great that we
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
served a lot of people but are their
 
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
lives better are they going on to get
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
well um and the answer to that was yes
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
so in that small cohort we could see um
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
symptom ology related to people's
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder at intake then we
 
00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:33.559 align:start position:0%
could see Medicaid claims where they're
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
receiving treatment and then at their
 
00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
six-month followup they're reporting
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
reduced symptomology related to their
 
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder as well as other
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
benefits around their relationships
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
their employment and their housing
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
status Senator with sure thank you madam
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
chair this is similar to representative
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
Weber's question but I'm curious did the
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
department initiate the uh evaluation
 
00:23:59.950 --> 00:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
from Pacific Health policy group and
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
what has been the progress made on the
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
development of this monitoring and
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
performance Improvement frame sure yeah
 
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
we did pursue the evaluation because the
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
doorways were new right so anytime
 
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
you're building new infrastructure after
 
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
a certain period of time in this case
 
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:17.799 align:start position:0%
was about 5 years to do a look back and
 
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
see how things were going um it was an
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
idea that was modeled off of a number of
 
00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:24.039 align:start position:0%
other states but whether or not things
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
that work in other states work in New
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is always a question for us so
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
we did pursue that evaluation in
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
dependently um and then we recently um
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
provided an update to the governor's
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
office which we provided to John and his
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
team about progress to date I don't
 
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
think we have that today but we can
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
provide it for the
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
wer thank you madam chair so along with
 
00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
the U results I would wonder the relapse
 
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
rate and some people coming back sure
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
they so sober for a while then they're
 
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
back then they're sober for a while on
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
their back and I would think you would
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
have the name from previously so you
 
00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
could say person is had four or five
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
relapses obviously that would say the
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
program wasn't working as intended sure
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
although I would argue that substance
 
00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
use disorder is a chronic health
 
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
condition that is relapsing in nature
 
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
like diabetes and hypertension and so um
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
needing to access care throughout your
 
00:25:22.389 --> 00:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
life is not uncommon and does not mean
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
that the person is failing or that the
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
treatment is failing um there are
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
certainly times where we're able to
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
connect people's records however there's
 
00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:32.919 align:start position:0%
a lot of um security and privacy
 
00:25:34.389 --> 00:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
particularly around substance use
 
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
disorder records from the federal level
 
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
with 42 CFR part two so for instance um
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
I live in summersworth so if I accessed
 
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
care from the Wentworth Douglas doorway
 
00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:45.799 align:start position:0%
in Dover and didn't have a good
 
00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:47.559 align:start position:0%
experience for some reason I could
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
present at the doorway in lonia and not
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
tell them that I was seen at a mass gen
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
hospital and those wouldn't necessarily
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
get connected because my records are
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
kept private and so we do our best to do
 
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
d d duplicate the number served um but
 
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
really we do have a come to the doorway
 
00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
early come to the doorway often
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
perspective and so um not limiting when
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
people are accessing Services the number
 
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
of times and how often is important to
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
us it seems like we're allowing the
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
Privacy to to interfere with really
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
making the program effective and we
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
ought to be able to do something about
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
that if they just repeatedly go to
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
different places and there's nine
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
different places they could go they're
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
they're hiding their relapse rate that's
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
not helping the program or helping the
 
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
person so the Privacy is is kind of
 
00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:39.799 align:start position:0%
overcoming more than it should yeah
 
00:26:41.789 --> 00:26:41.799 align:start position:0%
there are certainly some barriers um
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
that the Privacy um creates however when
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
people are known to various doorways um
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
we are doing something called case
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
conferencing where sort of everybody
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
gets together to talk about a case that
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
might be really difficult in nature um
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
the other thing that often happens with
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
people who are active in their substance
 
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
use disorder and potentially unhoused is
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
that they're naturally moving throughout
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
the state so they're not intentionally
 
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
saying I'm going somewhere else in order
 
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
to access care and circumvent the system
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
they just are experiencing homelessness
 
00:27:12.269 --> 00:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
in different parts of the state at
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
different times based on um where
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
housing I just wish we could change it
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
because supposedly the audit can take
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
place anywhere we've given public money
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
we should be able to audit and if these
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
things are are putting barriers in the
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
way they should be removed sure I think
 
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
we could look into the updates that 42
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
CFR part two had they're supposed to be
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
closer in line um with HIPPA um Medicaid
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
claims are often the easiest for the
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
Department to access where we can um
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
sort of at least pull our beneficiaries
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
of our insurance program and the doorway
 
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
program and line things up again it's
 
00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
limited in nature but that's what we've
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
been successful to do in the past and
 
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
offer some protection from
 
00:27:59.470 --> 00:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
privacy I was wondering we should have
 
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.710 align:start position:0%
privacy I was wondering we should have
access

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
to the um interactions of the Medicaid
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
recipients yeah certainly for billable
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
Services um I will venture to say
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of services that are being
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
provided by the doorways that are not
 
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
billable in nature but yes at least the
 
00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.389 align:start position:0%
billable in nature but yes at least the
treatment

00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
components so I have a couple of
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
questions this this program when it
 
00:28:29.789 --> 00:28:29.799 align:start position:0%
started was called the Hub and spoke and
 
00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:33.519 align:start position:0%
it was not a treatment program it was a
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
referral program and as I read this
 
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
scope statement it looks like there's
 
00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
been Mission creep into treatment and
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
support and not just referrals but when
 
00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:52.519 align:start position:0%
I look at table two on page five I
 
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
really don't see treatment or support
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
only in the lock Zone distribution
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
why the doorways say they Pro they're
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
providing treatment and support when
 
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
they were created to be a referral
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
program yeah sure great question um so
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
originally in 2018 when the state opioid
 
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
response Grant sort of first came to New
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire came to every state in
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um in the country we when
 
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
we heard from the community about what
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
the department should use this funding
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
for resoundingly the question that
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
needed to be answered was when people
 
00:29:37.389 --> 00:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
are ready to get Services where do they
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
go and that the community was asking for
 
00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
sort of a One-Stop shop place to send
 
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
folks and so it was created in this Hub
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
and spoke model over the over time as
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
the doorways have implemented our
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
service providers in the treatment space
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
were not always able to provide timely
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
access to treatment so there have been
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
two two things that have happened the
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
doorways sometimes provide like a bridge
 
00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
where they would um provide therapy or
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
medications in the meantime while
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
someone gets connected to care or in
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
some cases they're just beginning to
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
receive their care from the doorways and
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
with the intent to stay um it is has
 
00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
been in response to the community need
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
and to the building up of our substance
 
00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:23.559 align:start position:0%
use disorder infastructure um but you
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
are correct that it is not just a
 
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
referral and um transfer sort of system
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
but that the doorways are providing
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
treatment and services on their own so
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
should table two be
 
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
expanded to include treatment and
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
support or
 
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
Recovery Services
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
clients because I really don't see that
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
there yeah those metrics are from the
 
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
monthly report um that the doorways
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
provide to the
 
00:30:57.149 --> 00:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
department but that would be good
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
probably to
 
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.039 --> 00:31:07.789 align:start position:0%
 
also

00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
wonder I've always wondered about the
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. how
 
00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
effective that is for meeting the
 
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
clients when they need the help I mean
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
this this program replace safe stations
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
in Manchester in Nashville where you
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
could walk into a firehouse 24 hours a
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
day and in Nashville at least a
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
treatment provider would show up within
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
15 minutes I think Manchester took a
 
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
little longer
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
but is it possible for this audit to
 
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.070 align:start position:0%
but is it possible for this audit to
look

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
at how many more people could
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
be served if the inperson hours
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
were expanded and we backed away from
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
really most of the time being on a
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
phone and so that's another question I
 
00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:13.710 align:start position:0%
phone and so that's another question I
have

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
also um I know that you that the
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
doorways will help
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
pay for someone's out of pocket cost for
 
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.629 --> 00:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
and is
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
that possible to look at how many people
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
how much I mean because we're spending
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
$2,000 a client sure so what are we
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
getting sure so in regards to the first
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
question I certainly think that when
 
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
people are accessing care day of the
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
week in time is something that could and
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
should be looked at
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
um anecdotally I know that about half of
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
the volume of the doorways is happening
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
outside of business hours right so
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
that's 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. weekends
 
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
and holidays um certainly in certain
 
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
regions more than others and so looking
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
at the times that people are accessing
 
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
care um and the volume that's
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
represented could be really important
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
because we are doing a lot over the
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
phone and it's not as effective um just
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
by the the limitations of being on the
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
phone with someone rather than in person
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
um and then secondarily there is the
 
00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
funds that allow for for um methodone
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
treatment are a broader base fund that's
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
called the flexible needs fund um and my
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
my recommendation would be that that was
 
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
looked at broadly about what it um is
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
paid paying for um in addition to
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
medications so that group of funds can
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
also pay for housing and child care and
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
transportation um it's not a ongoing
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
source of funding and so the places that
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
it would be used to pay for someone's
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
medication would be um um shortterm and
 
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
temporary less than 30 days while their
 
00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
insurance was established um but it's
 
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
designed to reduce Financial barriers to
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
care but it's most often for
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
transportation so if I use the same
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
scenario as before I present at the
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
doorway in Dober I'm screened clinically
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
for an evaluation and I require a
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
residential level of care that bed is
 
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
available in lonia and I can't
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
physically get there the doorway can pay
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
for your transportation from do to lonia
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure you get the care you need
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
in a timely fashion without having to
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
worry about the $200 cab ride that you
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
might need to pay
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
for are those S funds too yes so there
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
are no General funds that support this
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
program no there are at times Blended
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
Governor's commissions funds from the
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund but not General
 
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
funds okay so are you able to amend the
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
questions um we could
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
we could amend it
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
um we were planning on addressing some
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
of those issues anyway in the audit um
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
and I can just make a note of that and
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
we can probably move on without without
 
00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%
without making an amendment language yes
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
but uh it is something i' I've jotted
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
down some notes that we can we can
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
certainly uh address in the
 
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
audit okay any further
 
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
questions yes represented or
 
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't have a question but I have a
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
number of comments if that's
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate um at this point in time I
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
plan to propose this um essentially
 
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
there for a few reasons one you
 
00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
essentially had an outside performance
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
audit performed last year as you
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
indicated by another firm and the
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
results of that are well reported on the
 
00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.630 align:start position:0%
results of that are well reported on the
HHS

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
HHS
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
website it's also a federal program and
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
there's Federal reporting required and
 
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
there again the Department's done a
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
great job of making those monthly
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
reports available on their website along
 
00:36:08.349 --> 00:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
with a really nice interactive dashboard
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
that you can also work with on a
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
countywide basis Statewide basis uh to
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
see the current results on a
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
month-to-month basis and
 
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
overall and it's all federal funds as
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
has been noted here and I think a
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
performance audit is better directed to
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
our general funds that's my personal um
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
feeling about this but the big problem I
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
have is here we are at the 11th Hour of
 
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
the term we literally end at midnight
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
tonight and in some ways we're jamming
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
up brand new legislature that's going to
 
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
be sworn in within the next 24 hours so
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
um I think this is a wrong time to be
 
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
you well based on representative Earth's
 
00:36:59.470 --> 00:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
comment here I guess my question is do
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
we have to do this today or can we wait
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
and do this and let the newly seated
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
committee do this is is is there a re
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me is there a reason from your
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
perspective in the LBA that we need to
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
today um it's a hard question to answer
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
um I think the answer is uh no we don't
 
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
need uh it to be approved today um
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
however this commission uh this
 
00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:28.150 align:start position:0%
however this commission uh this
committee

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
I guess expires tonight M um and we'll
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
we'll have a new committee uh with we
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
don't know who will be appointed to that
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:40.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's unknown at this point whether
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
the new committee would approve it or
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
not right which I I guess sort of leads
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
to the point of maybe it's better to let
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
the new committee direct you since
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's who you'll be working with them I
 
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
mean I suspect many of us will be back
 
00:37:57.069 --> 00:37:57.079 align:start position:0%
here again but I I know there will be
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
some new faces here I ju Just my
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
thoughts I wasn't sure if there was a a
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
pressing reason why we had to do this
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
today well I just say we did approve
 
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
this performance audit months and months
 
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
ago so and it was it I think a unanimous
 
00:38:19.309 --> 00:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
approval Senator yeah I was going to say
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
I think it's more appropriate for this
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
committee to improve the scope to
 
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
approve the scope one because we
 
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
approved the actual audit to proceed and
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
we requested that they produce the scope
 
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
statement in December and they did that
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
so I do feel like it's uh respectful of
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
their time and more appropriate for this
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
committee to vote on it okay
 
00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.710 align:start position:0%
committee to vote on it okay
representative

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
Weber uh I would I would agree with that
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing I I just want
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
to say is that um whether it's federal
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
funds or whether it's state funds it is
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
a state program and it is
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
State uh citizens um and if we are are
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
spending $76 million effectively that's
 
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
great but if we are spending $76 million
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
ineffectively I think we ought to know
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
that and figure out how to do it better
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh so I think the fact that the source
 
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
of the funds is federal and that there
 
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
are certain federal oversights certainly
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
I I would hope you would just
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
incorporate what's already been done for
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
work and not start over and I assume
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
that part of the reason that this is a
 
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.190 align:start position:0%
that part of the reason that this is a
fairly

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
shortterm uh relatively speaking um uh
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
audit reflects that but for me the issue
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
is whether we are making effective use
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
of resources for the benefit of citizens
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and that is doesn't
 
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
depend on where the funds come from and
 
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
I I would agree with that because we
 
00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
have a limit on sore funds and we keep
 
00:39:59.230 --> 00:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
expecting we're going to get less of
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
them and so I think it's important for
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
us to figure out if if this is a good
 
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
use of these federal funds or could we
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
be using them in a better way to provide
 
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
treatment and Recovery Support
 
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
Services to the thousands of granite
 
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
Staters who over from opioid use
 
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
disorder so I I think they on our do
 
00:40:38.829 --> 00:40:38.839 align:start position:0%
have done what we've asked them to
 
00:40:38.839 --> 00:40:40.710 align:start position:0%
have done what we've asked them to
do

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I know there will be a new committee
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
at some point I don't know when it'll be
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
appointed it'll be the house is turn to
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
share it I think isn't this one that
 
00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
flips back and forth
 
00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.390 align:start position:0%
flips back and forth
um

00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
so any further just yes gra thank you
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I'll just make one
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
comment related to your what you just
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
said I believe this is not just a
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
federal program but it's it's this
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
explicit program for all 50 states I
 
00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
don't think we can take the $76 million
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
and decide to spend it in some other
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
more effective way in which case I think
 
00:41:21.309 --> 00:41:21.319 align:start position:0%
you have a very good point but I think
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
we're basically stuck this is the
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
program that the federal government
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
wants us to run and this is the program
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
we have are requ to run Madam chair is I
 
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
don't think that's correct I don't think
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
either so um what the uh substance abuse
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
in mental health administration dictates
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
is essentially a list of required
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
activities of which New Hampshire has
 
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
says this is how we're going to meet
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
these required
 
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
activities um so it's one of sort of a
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
list if it is found that things are
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
being run inefficiently we can every 12
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
months make adjustments to our budget um
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
so for instance we're in a current um
 
00:41:59.710 --> 00:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
Federal funding year where the plan for
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
October needs to be presented to the
 
00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
feds in February um so we're sort of
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
always on this 12-month um wheel with
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
them where we're adjusting one of the
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
main ways that we're adjusting as we go
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
with the doorways is that their
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
thirdparty billing has increased over
 
00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
time quite significantly because of the
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
treatment component um that you brought
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
up before and so what you'll see is
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
money to the doorways decreasing over
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
time but that's because they're
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
leveraging other sources of funds as
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
well and so um I would encourage the
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
committee to look uh potentially across
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
funding sources and at like sort of the
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
bigger picture and not just at this um
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
use of temporary Grant dollars um but
 
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
the senator is right that the sore
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
allocation is temporary in nature and is
 
00:42:43.549 --> 00:42:43.559 align:start position:0%
currently funding infrastructure which
 
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
um could be problematic for the citizens
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
if the funding went
 
00:42:50.589 --> 00:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
away Madam chair I move acceptance of
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
the audit
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
scope is there second second
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
discussion do we want to have a roll
 
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
call or can we have a show of
 
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
hands if you're in favor of accepting
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
the scope statement please raise your
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
hand one two three four five six
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
seven and one of post thank you very
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
okay is there any suspended tabled and
 
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
topics yes representative wer I've had a
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
couple of people talk to me about
 
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
turnovers being worse in some parts of
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
the state employees than others and I'm
 
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
wondering how best to address this
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
whether we would look at go through all
 
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
HR and see which places are having a
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
bigger turnover and and you know Zone in
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
on them or whether it's we should go to
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
the particular one I've had complaints
 
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
about any
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
thoughts well that came out of
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
nowhere yeah it's well this was this was
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
one thing that somebody said what are
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
you doing about it this agency has a big
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
turnover and and you know what's what
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
can we do about it I'm wondering if if
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
an audit would be a way to go ah
 
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.510 align:start position:0%
an audit would be a way to go ah
representative

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
Weber I think that it would be helpful
 
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
if we had specific programs because I
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
mean the entire state is pretty Broad
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
and I know for example in areas that I
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
deal with sometimes there is the
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
question question of turnover in say
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
various dcyf offices and there's a huge
 
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
differential between one set and another
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
but I think it would be really helpful
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
to hone in on
 
00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:15.559 align:start position:0%
specific program areas rather
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
than just the whole ball of
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
wax would certainly sharpen my thinking
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
the point is if somebody says there's a
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
big turnover in our agency and we look
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
across the whole well there's a bigger
 
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
turnover over here and nobody's
 
00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:30.559 align:start position:0%
complaining about it well there's a
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
bigger turnover in another one so if if
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
I take the one I've got complaints about
 
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
have him Zone in on that are we missing
 
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
some of the bigger problems
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
that's so are you suggesting an audit
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
of HR vacancies well yeah I mean if if
 
00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
you went to HR and said give us the
 
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
turnover rate by agency
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
and then you could Zone in on say well
 
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
are these complaints I'm hearing more
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
valid in that agency than there is in
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
this agency so you know it it's just a a
 
00:46:11.069 --> 00:46:11.079 align:start position:0%
matter of looking at like a a year or a
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
year and a half uh rate of turnovers
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
in in all the agencies in the
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
states I don't know how how wide that
 
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.230 align:start position:0%
states I don't know how how wide that
would

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:46:28.589 --> 00:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh this is an interesting discussion um
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
interesting audit topic too that um I'm
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
sure we'd love to explore at some point
 
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
if it helps at all we're not looking for
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
a new topic
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
today we do still have um there are two
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
audits on the list that are currently
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
suspended as you know the um Bureau of
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
elderly and Adult Services and the aate
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
placements and then the last two audits
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
um on the list were uh DHHS audits so it
 
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
was contract management and then the
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Developmental Services those
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
are still on the list as potential audit
 
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
topics um and uh we still have Auditors
 
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
tied up on other audits right now so um
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
we can keep those on the list if you'd
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
like or uh we'd be happy to also
 
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
entertain additional topics if you'd
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
like and we can add them to the list
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
too yes representative Weber given that
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
you're not looking for added work at the
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
moment I would suggest along the points
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
that were made earlier that those are
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
two that could wait for the
 
00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
reconstituted committee so that they
 
00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:50.839 align:start position:0%
could start a fresh with
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
fresh eyes and fresh
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
perspectives and that um we simp L leave
 
00:47:59.470 --> 00:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
them for the moment because we don't
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
want to let go of them but uh that that
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing to have as a
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
starting point for the next committee
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
when you know when you have more
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
Auditors available uh always being aware
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
that we're going into a budget year so
 
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
anybody who is crossing the aisle so to
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
speak is going to be very busy indeed
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
okay so the next committee will consider
 
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:34.839 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
vacancies across state
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
government um other
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
business recognition of this isn't this
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
great do you all have this yep
 
00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
so yay great audit of liquor enforcement
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
and Licensing this is wonderful that was
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
a very extensive audit it 300
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
Pages it was and it was a it was an

Grady was the in charge of that audit
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
and the in charge position is always the
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
toughest hardest to do because you're
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
running the audit you're getting the
 
00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
questions from management and for the
 
00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
legislature this was the audit itself if
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
you remember in fiscal the same day we
 
00:50:57.789 --> 00:50:57.799 align:start position:0%
had two
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
this size that we presented in front of
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal and uh one thing this this
 
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
awarded for impact meaning something
 
00:51:08.589 --> 00:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
happened and a lot of legislation was
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
changed because of this and also rules
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
were written by the the um commission
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
and policy and procedures developed uh
 
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
based on what they reported back to
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and to the um New
 
00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire transparency site so we were
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
basing their the impact on what the
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
commission has reported they've done um
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
so a lot goes to the commission and also
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
for making sure impact
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
happened well I I mean that's the whole
 
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
reason to do these performance offs
 
00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
right and I always look when we see them
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
is legislation required or not and um
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're really helpful
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
