straw vote

that we had
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
the one of them that we dropped i we
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
elected to drop off
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
location of the toll plaza
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
when we did some investigation the
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
location of the toll plazas is normally
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
what is your point of order point of
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
order is
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
i was informed that we were working on
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
amendment ending in seven
 
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
but he is explaining what what happened
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
at the last executive session and what
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
we have changed since that last
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
executive session which you were not at
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%

00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
the question we are still gonna i'm
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
gonna let him speak okay fair enough mr
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
so in any case uh the uh
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
the uh actual final location of the
 
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.509 align:start position:0%
the uh actual final location of the
tolls

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
tolls
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
in merrimack is normally a budget item
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
and it has traditionally never been put
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i am speaking in
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
in support of the um amendment that's
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
before us today zero seven four five h
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
i think it has been
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
traditional in this committee to
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
really look at the history of what
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
happened in merrimack and i'm not from
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
merrimack so i don't presume to know
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
every single bit of history of this but
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
our understanding has always been that
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
the ramp tolls were placed
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
in a
 
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.069 align:start position:0%
in a
negotiation

00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
negotiation
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
with the state of new hampshire whereby
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire got involved
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
with continental boulevard its
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance etc
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
although some folks feel that merrimack
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
is targeted
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
i think to many people on this committee
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
we see it more as a um as fair
 
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.270 align:start position:0%
we see it more as a um as fair
to

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
if the if the toll booths are in fact
 
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.950 align:start position:0%
if the if the toll booths are in fact
returned

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
returned
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
or gotten rid of that they
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead and and take over the um
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
the maintenance again of continental
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
boulevard so just by way of uh the cost
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
analysis um just so we get this into the
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
record we did ask
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
d.o.t to go ahead and
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
estimate for us the loss of total
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
revenue to the turnpike
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
and cumulatively
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh annually and this relates to the time
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
of removal so i will say that with the
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
egg when they removed exit 10 we were in
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
covid so the
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
the revenues may have been slightly
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
less than usual
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
it was 1.7 million in net revenue loss
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
annually at the time of removal
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
the cost to remove the three toll plazas
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
was 1.9 million
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
the cost to remove the remnants of the
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
ramp toll with tunnels
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
etc is going to be 4 million dollars so
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
you can add those numbers up
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
the annual
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance cost of continental
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
boulevard is eighty thousand dollars and
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
it was last repaved in 2017
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
for seven hundred thousand dollars
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
so i thought
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
it would be good to at least get on the
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
record the costs uh that we're engaged
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
in here when we're in this discussion
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the bond that
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
relates to
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
continental boulevard is not yet repaid
 
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.549 align:start position:0%
continental boulevard is not yet repaid
so

00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:18.230 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
i would say that's the end of my
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
statement for now but uh
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to share the the costs and
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
where some of the at least i think a lot
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
of the members of this committee are
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative eagle
 
00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:36.390 align:start position:0%
thank you representative eagle
um

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative boyd
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you and uh through you
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
to my
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleagues of the general
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
general court i am in opposition
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
to the amendment
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh specifically the department of
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
transportation has been trying
 
00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.070 align:start position:0%
transportation has been trying
to

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
the lack of a better word unload
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
continental boulevard onto merrimack
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
along with the associated cost
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
a road which from the town standpoint
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
does not have any direct flow
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
in main flow as it relates to the town
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
the specific role of continental
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
boulevard in question is to serve as an
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
artery of feeder road from route 101
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
coming up to industrial drive to ask to
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
access the turnpike
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
preliminary cost to assume
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this road would be 200
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
200 000 annually to the town with the
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
potential long-term costs of over the
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
next 20 years of 2.5 2.5 million dollars
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
for this specific road which would
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
include the hiring of an additional
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
operator and potentially another piece
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
of equipment
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
town is is not prepared
 
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.270 align:start position:0%
town is is not prepared
nor

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
nor
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
did we want to accept responsibility
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
for this particular road because of the
 
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.039 align:start position:0%
increased cost of this particular road
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
it is difficult for me
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
as as a member of the community of
 
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.149 align:start position:0%
as as a member of the community of
merrimack

00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
merrimack
 
00:21:08.159 --> 00:21:09.110 align:start position:0%
merrimack
to

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.310 align:start position:0%
to
ask

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
ask
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
the state for us to assume to assume not
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
just the short-term but the long-term
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
burden of maintaining a road
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
that honestly was the state's
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
a specific arterial flow through that
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
through that section of merrimack and
 
00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.909 align:start position:0%
through that section of merrimack and
the

00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
i would humbly ask all of you to oppose
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment because this is this is a
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
specific form of downshifting
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
of the state responsibility onto the
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
town of merrimack and by no means
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the removal of the
 
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.110 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the removal of the
tolls

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
tolls
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
that that was included when the tolls
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
were being removed that that was
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
included in the conversation that we
 
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
would assume responsibility of
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
continental boulevard that's that's
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know if any
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
thinking that there never was a part of
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
the conversation or the equation so i
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
would sincerely ask my colleagues to
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
oppose the amendment thank
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
you representative jack
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i would point
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
out to everyone that the that the
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
turnpike system is a zero-sum game
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
because every dollar of work that funds
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system it comes from toll
 
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.510 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system it comes from toll
collection

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
collection
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
if you reduce toll collection you reduce
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
the amount of work
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
that can be done and because the bond
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
covenants require that preservation be
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
done before new construction
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
any dollar that is spent on continental
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
boulevard will
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
act to delay new construction on the
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
turnpike such as the widening project
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
that runs through merrimack
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
and that's not an outcome that we want
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
on the amendment
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
we have concentrated on one paragraph is
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
there any discussion on the other
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
elements within the amendment that we
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
did discuss at our last
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
c none are we ready for the vote
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%

that
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
my predecessor former speaker dick hinch
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
did in warning
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the tolls at exits 10 11
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
and 12.
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
by proposing to move this overhead plaza

to this amendment
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
um it's saying that
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh a portion of
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
the proceeds of the sale shall be used
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
to relocate this facility to a new
 
00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.270 align:start position:0%
to relocate this facility to a new
location

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
do we have a percentage or are we using
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
the way i had them drafted where it says
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
a portion
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
it is to make sure that
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
if land is required to be purchased if a
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
building has to be renovated or if there
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
is a construction that is needed on the
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
new emergency center that is currently
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
located on that facility that is paid
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
for with those funds so that two years
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
from now we don't have an agency sitting
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
before this very committee asking to
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
borrow 20 or million or whatever the
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
number might end up being that we would
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
have to borrow
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
so if the cash is there from a sale
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh and we're forcing people to move i
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
think we should use it to do that that's
 
00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.670 align:start position:0%
think we should use it to do that that's
why

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
um we had that discussion
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
among several of the members to do that
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
i took it upon myself to bring the
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
amendment in but now it's in the
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
possession of the committee
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
so it's up to the committee on whether
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
or not to accept this or do something
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
else with the bill
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%

uh
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering is the intent the way it's
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
written to mean that they would this
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
building this new facility would also
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
support both
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
the 911 center and the lakes region
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
that is the way it is written and it
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
would be up to
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
the lawyers to sort out whether
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
we could even do it for for somebody
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
else but it was the intention to move
 
00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.990 align:start position:0%
else but it was the intention to move
everybody

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
it was invaluable to have your input
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
even though
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
you may not like everything we did but
 
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.030 align:start position:0%
you may not like everything we did but
um

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
it um is still useful
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
that being said are there any
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
comments or
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
announcements from any members of the
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
committee mr chairman
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
and i just want to follow i know i asked
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
you this question earlier but do you
 
00:41:52.319 --> 00:41:53.670 align:start position:0%
you this question earlier but do you
anticipate

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
any of these bills that we act on today
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
being on the next when we meet again as
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
a full house on march 10th or you you
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
i can virtually guarantee that the two
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
that are going on consent calendar will
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
be on that calendar um the the goal of
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
the clerk and the speaker is to put
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
everything that comes in on consent
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
put it on the calendar
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
move the bills forward there are still
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
several hundred bills
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
that the house has to deal with over the
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
next month
 
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.470 align:start position:0%
next month
um

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
so it depends on how many bills
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
come come in whether or not the 10-year
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
plan is on the next one
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
i would be willing
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
to give it
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
a passing grade on that it will be
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
just so that it moves forward
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
but again it depends on
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
how much
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
how many other bills come in
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
and his goal is to try to minimize two
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
day meetings as you notice in his his
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
message out to everybody
 
00:42:59.359 --> 00:43:00.390 align:start position:0%
message out to everybody
that

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
not only are we meeting on the the
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
10th and 17th and 31st but he also
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
talked about the 16th
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
and 30th if needed
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
hopefully we will
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
have as many as possible on the 10th
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
knowing that even if we don't get
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
through them all
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%

00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
