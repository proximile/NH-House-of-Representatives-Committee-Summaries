the
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
election law committee which was my
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
first committee in 2005 and 2006.
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
so anyway i'm ralph baume hillsborough
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
district 20 in the town of litchfield
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
we along with rhode island have the last
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
primary date in
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
the country depending on the calendar we
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
are desperately close to the federal
 
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.230 align:start position:0%
are desperately close to the federal
limit

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
as of the number of days before the
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
general election
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
luckily in the past few elections we
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
have not needed the recount if so we
 
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
would have had a problem
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
moving it up a month will get more time
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
for absentee ballots
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
to be utilized especially for the
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
military even the 45-day deadline for
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots makes it difficult
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
for military members overseas to request
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
a ballot from their town
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
and then mail it back in time a quick
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
shot count
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
shows that 16 other places have their
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
primary in august
 
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
and currently we have a longer primary
 
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.469 align:start position:0%
and currently we have a longer primary
than

00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
general election moving up earlier
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
then that will cause problems for
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
example to june we'll make a five-month
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
election cycle
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
this will only make elections more
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
expensive for candidates
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
and make it easy for only the rich to
 
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.750 align:start position:0%
and make it easy for only the rich to
win

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
win
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
of course the u.s postal service and
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
print shops will make more money as
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
other media
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
and that will cause moving the filing
 
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
date to march
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
forces candidates to have a total of an
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
eight month election cycle
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
and with the redistricting happening
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
will definitely cause a problem from
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
past experience
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
experiences seriously doubt it will be
 
00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
finished earlier than may
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
and just heard census data will be
 
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
late also no
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
town elections are in march in april
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
people need a break from elections
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
starts from town elections in january
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
then state and federal january to
 
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.710 align:start position:0%
then state and federal january to
november

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
november
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have signs up along the roads all
 
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.070 align:start position:0%
we'll have signs up along the roads all
year

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
so with that uh thank you and i'll
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%

00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.230 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald thank you madam
chairman

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative i was just curious august
 
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.070 align:start position:0%
representative i was just curious august
obviously

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
is one of the heavy summer months are
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
you concerned about burnout
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
or participation as a result of a
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
primary in august
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
not really i think it'd be better right
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
now we have a
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
problem within september it's right
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
after labor day and school starting
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
in june if we move it to june we also
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
have a big problem because of
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
of uh schools getting out and uh
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
and uh you know in colleges you know
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
people getting ready to go to college
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
and making the trips and whatnot so
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
i think august like i said 16 other
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
states have their primary
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
in august and it doesn't be a problem
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
and with absentee ballots of people
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
going on vacation
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
they and whatnot they can request an
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you other committee
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
members representative for homework
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
do you think this will help college
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
students who are making plans
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
to move from their
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
where their home is to the dormitories
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
to help them to vote in our state
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
well if they're not in the state and
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
they're not residents of the state at
 
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
the time of the primary which
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
would be any time like during the summer
 
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
yeah they wouldn't be able to vote
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
does any committee member participating
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anybody raise their hand
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
online representative barry do you have
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
yes um did you mention that moving the
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
primary day
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
since june raised across the election
 
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.190 align:start position:0%
since june raised across the election
for

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
i can't hear that you said in your
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
your uh in your testimony that moving
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
the primary date to
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
june would raise the costs for
 
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.790 align:start position:0%
june would raise the costs for
candidates

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
i'm curious how that would raise their
 
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.550 align:start position:0%
i'm curious how that would raise their
responses

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
responses
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it would increase the cost
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
for anybody running for
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
a five-month cycle i mean it's
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
it's you know we constantly being
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
we will be bombarded and finally people
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
stop even listening
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh also what the big problem i see this
 
00:11:57.839 --> 00:11:58.790 align:start position:0%
uh also what the big problem i see this
year

00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
is moving it the filing date would
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
probably then have to be in march
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
we won't have to be distinctly done
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
before that and i've been involved
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
with happening two two redistricting
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
and it's not gonna happen by may
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
i mean you know before before may
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
and i remember 20 years ago it didn't
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
happen until end
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
toward the end of june so redistricting
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
i think the major concern you're going
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
to have to look at
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to happen before
 
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.389 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to happen before
may

00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
it was the laptop i believe that was
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
creating the feedback yes
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
it showed my microphone was off the
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
whole time so i think if we have a break
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask my tea to come to look
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
because i'm having a little problem
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
with my controls all right thank you
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%

her
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
which is like when we have somebody
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
down if they could come on a break to
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%

giving me the opportunity to speak today
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
on behalf of this bill i
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
am in support of this bill um
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
i did provide an advanced written
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
testimony so i hope that you guys were
 
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:20.710 align:start position:0%
testimony so i hope that you guys were
able

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
able
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
to see that but i'll launch right in um
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
i have been a member of the military for
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
35 years and i've been a proud resident
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
since 1993 and um i have been deployed
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
many many times and recalled back to
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
active duty and every single time i've
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
been deployed to recall back to active
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
duty i've had to
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
ask for an absentee ballot during
 
00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:45.030 align:start position:0%
ask for an absentee ballot during
elections

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
because because i am a resident of new
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire but i'm living in other states
 
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:49.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire but i'm living in other states
or

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
abroad and um so i'm very
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
very accustomed to taking the absentee
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
ballot i have been asking for this very
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
bill for many many years
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
um over a decade because i do feel like
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
that as military members we are
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised when it comes to voting
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh these short windows between primary
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
and general election days
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
even though it fits within that 45-day
 
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.110 align:start position:0%
even though it fits within that 45-day
federal

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
law we're really at 56 days and so
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
if the postal service is slow or if the
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
clerk's office is slow getting the
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
ballots out
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
or in my very own case one time i had to
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
have a recount and so that delayed
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
preparing the general ballot when there
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
was a recount and so
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
um when there are those delays
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
then uh the ballots don't get to us in
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
time and you can imagine being in a war
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
zone and we've been in a protracted war
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
now for over 17 years over in the middle
 
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.110 align:start position:0%
now for over 17 years over in the middle
east

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
east
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
mail comes mail isn't always a priority
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
if there's other things that they have
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
to get there for us to be able to fight
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
a war
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
the mail is not going to be the priority
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
and so there can be delays in getting
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
our ballots to us
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
and so a bill such as this that would
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
back up the primary date so that the
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
um the different you know the general
 
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
ballots can be prepared
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
and they can be sent out a little bit
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
sooner will
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely help uh folks like us who are
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
deployed or out of
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
out of the state to deal with delays in
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
the postal service
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
and get our ballots to us and i'll just
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
share one little quick war story uh for
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
those of you don't know i
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
served aboard usns comfort last march um
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
in support of cobit relief and our ship
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
was docked in new york city
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
and on april 1st my daughter sent me a
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
little care package just had some easter
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
chocolate in it
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
from her home in texas to new york city
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
you would think that would get there
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
very easily
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
post office guaranteed delivery before
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
easter which fell on april 12th
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
the package was returned to her in
 
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.069 align:start position:0%
the package was returned to her in
september

00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
september
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
that was a five-month delay in the
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
postal service
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
getting a box of chocolate um here
 
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
within the united states so we can see
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
that there are delays in the postal
 
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.629 align:start position:0%
that there are delays in the postal
service

00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
and i think any um length of time and
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
certainly this
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
additional month would greatly serve our
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
military and
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know i don't want to you know blow
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
our own horn here
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
but military members are the ones who
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
protect and defend the constitution for
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
all of us abroad and
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
um voting is one of our fundamental
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
rights and we want to be engaged in
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
active citizens even when we are far
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
away from our communities
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
and this is a great way for you guys to
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
honor our service
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
and ensure that our vote matters so i'm
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
but thank you very much for the
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share my concerns and my
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
 
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing on questions from committee
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
if i could just interrupt could people
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
hear representative barry when he was
 
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.390 align:start position:0%
hear representative barry when he was
speaking

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
because the microphones are placed in
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
different positions
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
today well we have somebody here if
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
anybody if you've had problems hearing
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative berries would you let me
 
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.549 align:start position:0%
representative berries would you let me
know

00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
well we can hear them because we're in
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
the room since the microphone last week
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
was down there and now it's up here i
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
it looks like people could um just to be
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
your representative
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
and you want to move that microphone and
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you i i do have a question for you
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
um this that you're speaking on today
 
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.630 align:start position:0%
um this that you're speaking on today
proposes

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
proposes
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
that it be moved to
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
tuesday in august we have some other
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
notes that we're hearing
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
today that are proposing june
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
september other dates to i understand
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
that you're in favor of
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
moving the primary lead do you have an
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
opinion as to what
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily you know i think that
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh obviously the september date is very
 
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.150 align:start position:0%
uh obviously the september date is very
tight

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
tight
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
because that only gives us about 56 days
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
between uh
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
the which is where we currently are
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
since september i think
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
august definitely gives another
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity especially
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
in the um if there is a recount
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
and there might be a further delay uh it
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
seems to be successful in other states
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say you know if that
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
if backing it up to june would make a
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
more of a difference obviously we just
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
want more time
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
so at least me and and i should say
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
right away that i'm not speaking on
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
behalf of the department of defense or
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
the united states navy this is purely
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
lin testimony of lynn blankenback or not
 
00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:01.270 align:start position:0%
lin testimony of lynn blankenback or not
um

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
you know not the united states navy um
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
but um you know
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
any any extra time you can give us would
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
be great
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
um and i i really don't have an opinion
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
on the merits of a june date or
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
or a april date or a you know a further
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
date i haven't done an analysis to
 
00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
that would be more cost effective or i
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
just know for me personally being in the
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
military that
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
any extra time you could give us would
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
be great
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
not seeing it thank you very much for
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%

has always been held
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
in the month of september we have had no
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
to the voters in time for them to be
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
able to vote in the general election
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
there's a federal statute that requires
 
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.630 align:start position:0%
there's a federal statute that requires
that

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%

voters

00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
no later than 45 days before the
 
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:51.029 align:start position:0%
no later than 45 days before the
election

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
provided the request has been made of
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
that voter
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
that statute also goes on to say that
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
in the case of military voters we have
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
email ballots to them in other words
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
deliver the ballot
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
to the voter electronically which we
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
which we do and we
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
meet the we meet the 45-day deadline
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
with very few exceptions and then it's
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
up to the voter to
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
download the ballot uh mark it
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
and then uh return it to the city or
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
town clerk
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the town or city that
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
they live in
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
in the past the department of defense
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
has been incredibly helpful especially
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
when we're in a wartime situation
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
and we have many troops overseas
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know that are serving the country
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
they step up
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
and have collected ballots in the past
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
and returned them to the states
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
and made sure that the delivery through
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
the postal service was expedited
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
this past election cycle has been an
 
00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:03.110 align:start position:0%
this past election cycle has been an
exception

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
exception
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
where the the the post office has just
 
00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:07.029 align:start position:0%
where the the the post office has just
had

00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
very difficult time delivering uh
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
mail period in a timely manner and
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
that seems to be an internal problem
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
with post office
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know whether it's a funding issue or
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
an absentee issue because because of
 
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.310 align:start position:0%
an absentee issue because because of
covid

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
covid
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
i think we all recognize that the mail
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
service today
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
is not what it was even two or three
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
so that is an issue that needs to be
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of this specific bill and an
 
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.990 align:start position:0%
in terms of this specific bill and an
august

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
august
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
date for a primary the one concern that
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
we would have is that
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
that families are generally in vacation
 
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.149 align:start position:0%
that families are generally in vacation
mode

00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
mode
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are taking time off from
 
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.190 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are taking time off from
work

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
and states that have moved their
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
primaries into
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
the month of august have had
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
have had their turnout drop in general
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
terms and
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
i think vermont is a good example
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
they're experimenting with
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh moving the date of their primary
 
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.310 align:start position:0%
uh moving the date of their primary
earlier

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh than it had been uh they moved it to
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
the last week in august
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh a few years ago uh then they moved it
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
earlier into august
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
and and i'm not quite sure where they
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
stand at the moment but
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh trying to figure out what the what
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
the perfect date of holding their
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
primary is
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
at least to the state of vermont seems
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
to be a moving target
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
so with that madam chair i would be
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions
 
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:50.830 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions
representative

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
window

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
back in madam share i had
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
great difficulty hearing the question i
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if somebody could repeat it
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative yeah i'll try speaking a
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
little louder can you hear me better now
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's better yes so my question is
 
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.630 align:start position:0%
that's better yes so my question is
whether

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
or not the primaries in september or
 
00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:17.830 align:start position:0%
or not the primaries in september or
august

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
august
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
would would be still be the same 45-day
 
00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:21.909 align:start position:0%
would would be still be the same 45-day
window

00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
window
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
after developing people to get their
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
the federal requirement is 45 days i
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't think that there is anything to
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
prevent us
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
from sending the ballots the absentee
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
ballots out to
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
military and overseas voters if they are
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
a golf question to know
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
right now what kind of rate of return we
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
get back from military
 
00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:53.029 align:start position:0%
get back from military

uh i don't have the answer to that
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
at the moment but let me call the people
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%

those ballots and i'll see if i can get
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
the competitiveness of the primaries in
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
the states
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
didn't just look at it as a biome itself
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
without the the the extra background
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
so secretary can you hear me
 
00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:49.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
mr secretary can you hear me now yes
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
that's better
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
so i have a question about the study
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
that you cited about the primary date
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
moving back did that study
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
can include competitiveness of the
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
primaries in terms of turnout and what
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
i'm getting at is
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
if there's not a competitive primary
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
less people are voting
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
so correlation is not necessarily
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
causation and i'm wondering if the study
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
that you decided
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
incorporated that i
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
represent barry i don't have a specific
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
study it's more
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members with
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
questions representative providence
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i will try to speak clearly
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
and loudly for you representative
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
o'brien i can hear you just fine okay
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh are you aware of
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
other states with an august primary
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
and can you tell us a little bit about
 
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.590 align:start position:0%
and can you tell us a little bit about
the

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
voter turnout rates in those states and
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you uh well
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
yes i mean there are states that have
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
august primaries
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
vermont is probably the closest example
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
and you know what i should do is compile
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh some of the data that you're
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
requesting in terms of you know
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
in those states compared to new
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i'll make an effort to do
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
that very
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
very quickly thank you follow up thank
 
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.149 align:start position:0%
very quickly thank you follow up thank
you

00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
this would be an anecdotal situation but
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm curious if you're aware of any
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
service member who has
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
been disenfranchised because of this
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh september primary that they missed
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
deadlines by just a few days
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
have you ever heard of such a thing
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
yes i mean i i i think that probably
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
happens in
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
every election where we receive military
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
and overseas ballots
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh after the election uh that also
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
happens in the general population
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh where we receive ballots absentee
 
00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.630 align:start position:0%
uh where we receive ballots absentee
ballots

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh after the fact and and we do know
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
that that there are service men and
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
women that
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
serve in very remote locations
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know in duty and service to the
 
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.310 align:start position:0%
you know in duty and service to the
country

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
and those voters do have a very
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
difficult time
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
getting their ballots back in time to be
 
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.470 align:start position:0%
getting their ballots back in time to be
counted

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
counted
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives growing
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
up your secretary uh for you
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
having you in august of june
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
let me repeat the question if you can
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
hear me i can hear you
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
you had a preference as to the actual
 
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.350 align:start position:0%
you had a preference as to the actual
date

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
as to between august and june and you're
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
asking asking him that keeping in mind
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
that the office didn't ask for either of
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
those dates
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
i i think both of those dates have have
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
different challenges i think
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
the the moving the date uh into early
 
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.509 align:start position:0%
the the moving the date uh into early
august

00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
august
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh is going to be competing with family
 
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.590 align:start position:0%
uh is going to be competing with family
vacations

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
vacations
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
and uh and summertime activities which
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
may diminish
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh turnout uh moving it to june
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
is a little bit different because
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
the the filing period would be taking
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
place right in the middle of the
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
legislative session
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
um you know it would probably be
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
sometime in march i think that's the
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
date that's in that
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
legislation we're kind of starting to
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
talk about the next bill now but
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
um you know new hampshire
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
elects an entirely new state government
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
every two years
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
and so if there's a filing in march
 
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.029 align:start position:0%
and so if there's a filing in march
after

00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh i mean
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
you're elected in november you take your
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
seats in
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
december and then a little over a year
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
later the filing period is
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
beginning for the next election i mean
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
you tell me whether you think that's
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good idea or not i mean i
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
i think that you could have a pretty
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
good debate on that
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
um where you know you're you're you're
 
00:34:23.919 --> 00:34:24.790 align:start position:0%
um where you know you're you're you're
in

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
full election mode before uh
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
halfway through the legislative session
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
is over in the second year of the
 
00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:35.349 align:start position:0%
is over in the second year of the
biennium

00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you i have another uh
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
more specific question regarding service
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
members overseas from new hampshire
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh trying to vote in the primary
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
elections here
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
email was not available
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
to those service members where they were
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
unable to obtain a ballot that was
 
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
emailed to them
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
because of the um area that they're in
 
00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.510 align:start position:0%
because of the um area that they're in
and

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
yes they were unable to vote has that
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
ever happened
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge i cannot cite a
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
specific example of that happening
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
but i i you know just understanding
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
where service some service
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
members are deployed that i think it's
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
very likely that that has happened
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
that uh you know a member of our
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
military is in
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
such a remote location um
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
and you know and performing whatever the
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
duty is that
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know that may be highly classified
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
or or whatever that
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's it is probably virtually impossible
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
for them to
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
receive a ballot and return it in time
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you deputy is there
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
any other member of the public that
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
would like to speak in regards to this
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
mr becker i see that um you have your
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
hand raised
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
and if you on you you should be able to
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
join us thank
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you so much for an opportunity
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
to speak again
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to uh underscore
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
that when we're in an austere
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
environment we have limited to no
 
00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.630 align:start position:0%
environment we have limited to no
connectivity

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
connectivity
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
and sometimes you do have internet um
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
for a little bit
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
and you can request say an email ballot
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
but then you know like my situation when
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
i was in afghanistan
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
we had rocket attacks all the time and
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
when a rocket came in it took our
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
internet out and it could take weeks
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
to get our internet back and so relying
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
on an internet ballot for
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
people in the military in an austere
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
environment really
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
is not an option for us and i don't
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
think that that should play
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
into the mix here relying on
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
that we do all have voter assistance
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
um teams for us in the military at least
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
in the navy we do and so they do a
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
really good job trying to help us
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
be able to vote and um
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
and so i appreciate all the efforts that
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
folks have made to help us vote but this
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
extended time would help us
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
get through those postal system lags and
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know i can speak for myself i
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
ordered a ballot
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
when i was overseas and i i never even
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
got it
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
um so i was denied my right to vote even
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
though i ordered the ballot
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
and um so i am one of those people that
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
can speak to that
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
which is why this has become so
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
passionate for me and why i've been
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
asking for decades for this uh process
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
to change i
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
also would um suggest that i know there
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
are 16 states that have an
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
august time primary but there are other
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
states that have much earlier primaries
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
and that's wildly successful for other
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
states and so
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
with only two states having a late
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
primary yes in rhode island
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
but yet 48 other states have a longer
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
um opportunity to
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
between the primary and the general i
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
think that that
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
probably is very telling that other
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
states have found this to be wildly
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
successful and
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
certainly successful for those of us in
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
the military
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know so so i i hope that that can
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
get added into my testimony although it
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
wasn't in my written testimony thank you
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
thank you elizabeth
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
brock has her hand raised miss ruff
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
if you can speak you have been joined
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
into the panelists and if you would
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
welcome um
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm trying to start my video
 
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.670 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm trying to start my video
also

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
um i'm just looking through this and i
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
i've been reading it off and on over the
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
last week when it was brought to my
 
00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.230 align:start position:0%
last week when it was brought to my
attention

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
um by a friend of mine who i had worked
 
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:53.910 align:start position:0%
um by a friend of mine who i had worked
with

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
in 2016 to get a third party
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
presidential candidate
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
on our ballot in new hampshire and
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
so am i understanding this correctly
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
that this would shorten
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
the time that um activists or
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
you know citizens would be allowed to
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
petition to get a third party candidate
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
on our ballots
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
it does mean that the primary uh dates
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
in regards to candidate filings would be
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
to get on the ballot would be moved up i
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
would presume
 
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am chair that that is a a very
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
good point
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
um at the moment uh third-party
 
00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.589 align:start position:0%
um at the moment uh third-party
candidates

00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
or uh third-party organizations that
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
are trying to obtain ballot status have
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
the year of the election to collect
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
their signatures
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
and the deadline for turning those
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
signatures in
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
to achieve that party style status is
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's around the date of our
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
september primary so uh if
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
the date of the primary were to change i
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
there would have to be a corresponding
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh provision in statute to address
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
the filings that are required by third
 
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.630 align:start position:0%
the filings that are required by third
parties

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
um i i just wanted to make sure that it
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to shorten
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
the time period i mean i don't
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
first see myself um working on a
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
working to help a third party candidate
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
however i am a supporter of a vibrant
 
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.829 align:start position:0%
however i am a supporter of a vibrant
democracy

00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
and sure
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
we have this wonderful vibrant new
 
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.510 align:start position:0%
we have this wonderful vibrant new
hampshire

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
primary i've always wondered why it
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't more
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
open supportive for third-party
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
candidates to participate
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%

they have the option of either
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
requesting just a regular ballot or
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
having their ballot emailed to
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%

and mail it back to you or do they
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
send it back to you by email
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
they have to print the ballot on
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
whatever printer they have
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else here to testify
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair my fellow fellow
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
goffstown representative that i voted
 
00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.190 align:start position:0%
goffstown representative that i voted
for

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
representative joe alexander i represent
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
the town of goffstown
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
hillsborough district six um hb 98
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
is relative to this date of the prime
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
state primary election uh much like the
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
last bill
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
um so this this would move the primary
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
to june
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
um i believe that this bill this bill is
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill that makes the process
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
more democratic
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
um 413 days passed from the beginning of
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
the gop
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
us primary in 2000 in 2020
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
and between the september 8th primary
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
and the november 3rd general election
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
was just 56 days
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
to have such a drastic difference
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
between the time
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
spent on elections deprives general
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
election voters of a fully fleshed out
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
and nuanced campaign primary voters and
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
general election voters are different
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
universes of voters and to give our
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
candidates only
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
roughly seven weeks to speak to a
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
general election after spending more
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
than a year on their primary
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
inflates the role of the primary voter
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
in the process and diminishes the role
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
of the average general election voter
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
by moving the primary to the second
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
tuesday in june we'll give both
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
will give voters on both sides
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
republican and democrat plenty of time
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
to debate the issues
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
and discuss their primary elections
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
before uh while also giving general
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
election voters
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
more time to debate the candidates
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
debate the candidates before the state
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
when holding elections we should give
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
voters the most time and research to
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
study the candidates hold
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
and the differences between them having
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
a late primary
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
could possibly have a recount and that
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
would give only six weeks
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
for the nominees to fight for the
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
general election a win
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
um so like said like the last hearing
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has the second latest
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
primary in the nation state primary um
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
and our voters prove time and time
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
time again that they pay attention um
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
some have speculated that granite
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
staters wouldn't pay attention to a
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
primary election held further away from
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
the general
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
um that argument falls apart when we
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
recognize that we are the first the
 
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.510 align:start position:0%
recognize that we are the first the
nation

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
nation
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
um and we have some of the highest
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
participation in the nation
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
so um long story short i think this bill
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
is needed i think it
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
makes the process more democratic and
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take any questions
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
any questions members in the room
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
attending electronically
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative bergeron
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um representative
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
just a question it was brought up
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
earlier by one of uh
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
another question of for the other bill
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
if a third party wants to get on the
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
ballot it has to pull nomination papers
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
during the calendar year in which the
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
election is being held
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
and those nomination papers have to be
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
submitted i believe it's one week before
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
the date of the primary election
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
so in effect your bill would shorten the
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity for third party candidates
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
or independents to get on the ballot
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
they only have
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
less than five months to collect
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
signatures now instead of
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps the nine months that they
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
currently have do you think
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
that window would need to be changed as
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
well to ensure that they have the same
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
amount of time
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
to get on the ballot as they currently
 
00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.710 align:start position:0%
to get on the ballot as they currently
have

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative for the
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
question i don't i personally do not see
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
a problem with the five month window i
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
think it provides plenty of time
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
um for those third-party um candidates
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
get on the ballot
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
all right thank you further questions
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
from committee members attending

new hampshire
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
um i do fully support hb 98
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that changing the primary day
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
to a sooner date
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
is long overdue here in new hampshire it
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
is vitally important
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
for the general public to compare and
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
contrast candidates and equally
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
important for voter information and
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
this will also facilitate voters to have
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
more time to be engaged in issues and
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
views of the candidates for the general
 
00:48:50.559 --> 00:48:52.230 align:start position:0%
views of the candidates for the general
election

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
having the primary in the first week of
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
june allows the winners to have the
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
summer months to share themselves with
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
the voters during cookouts
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
parades home days fairs and other warm
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
including the 4th of july
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
other considerations for this change are
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
national committee's endorsements
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
having to wait until september for
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
candidates to have access to national
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
funding for the general election
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
an earlier primary allows for better
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
distribution of funds
 
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
available alongside other states
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
an earlier primary allows for greater
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
unity in each
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
party for a particular candidate after a
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
contested primary
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
adding strength to the message of the
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
primary winner
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
as it stands now the primary winner has
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
approximately only seven weeks to
 
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:43.990 align:start position:0%
approximately only seven weeks to
organize

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
for voter access an earlier primary will
 
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
for all intents and purposes eliminate
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
the need to have candidates sign a
 
00:49:58.319 --> 00:49:58.950 align:start position:0%
the need to have candidates sign a
pledge

00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
pledge
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
to support unity after the primary as
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
time will be permitted
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
after a contested primary for sides to

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
i personally have been involved in
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
several campaigns for local
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
international office in several
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
states and by comparison i have
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
first-hand knowledge and experience that
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
the earlier
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
the primary the better voter involvement
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
an earlier primary allows the voter to
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
feel empowered with a sense of belonging
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
and responsibility of the issues
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
concerning them
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
as time has afforded them to learn the
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%

more about the political process here in
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
i have realized that a change needs to
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
be made
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
with respect to the primary date
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
we need a date that will work with the
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
voters and encourage voter engagement
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
more specifically
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
youth voter engagement during my time in
 
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:50.790 align:start position:0%
youth voter engagement during my time in
college

00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
thus far i have noticed a significant
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
lack in youth participation in our local
 
00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:56.390 align:start position:0%
lack in youth participation in our local
state

00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
and federal election process a great
 
00:52:59.599 --> 00:52:59.990 align:start position:0%
and federal election process a great
many

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
youths lack appreciation for the primary
 
00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:03.750 align:start position:0%
youths lack appreciation for the primary
process

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately only become focused
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
for the general election as the primary
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
is long
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
arduous and crowded i strongly encourage
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
our state leaders
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
to move our primary day from september
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
to the first tuesday in june
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
by doing so we'll afford young voters in
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
the entire summer season to learn and
 
00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.030 align:start position:0%
the entire summer season to learn and
evaluate

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
evaluate
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
two candidates and will be more inclined
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
to attend various events while at the
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
same time
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
enjoying the nice summer weather young
 
00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:38.950 align:start position:0%
enjoying the nice summer weather young
voters

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
are not inclined to endure the gobs of
 
00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.069 align:start position:0%
are not inclined to endure the gobs of
information

00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
about the candidates positions during a
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
summer primary season
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
but rather prefer a spirited contest
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
between two candidates from both
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle i think of our
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
political political process
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
as a sports playoff but having real life
 
00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.109 align:start position:0%
as a sports playoff but having real life
consequences

00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
the primary is the divisional playoffs
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
and the general election
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
is the finals in the sports world
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
more people pay attention to the final
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
with more media coverage and opinion
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
about the participants the political
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
demeanor between the primary
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
and the general will entice more youth
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
involvement and we'll be much more
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
inclined to tune
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
into that final between the two teams
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
sounds exciting right well
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
this is how we excite and engage young
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
folks empowering
 
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
us so that we can have an impact and a
 
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.349 align:start position:0%
us so that we can have an impact and a
sense

00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
of belonging i know
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
for a fact that our elected officials
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
prefer more young people to be
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
politically involved
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
and to appreciate the democratic
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
republic system that we have
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
therefore the youth in new hampshire
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
would be more inclined
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
to become better educated in politics
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
and even be inspired to be a part of the
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
next generation of leaders
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
by moving the primary i believe that it
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
will have a positive and lasting
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
impact on granite state youth for
 
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.710 align:start position:0%
impact on granite state youth for
generations

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
generations
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
to come thank you very thank much
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
witness in regards to house bill 98
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
relative to the state primary
 
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.390 align:start position:0%
relative to the state primary
representative

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%

um you know i heard you you want a
better

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
candidate and the general election you
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
also think it's important to vet
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
the candidates during the primary uh
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
forward of the election as well and you
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
send defense to to get to know and
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
see the policy uh ideas that
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i like clark i cut out a
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
little bit uh did can you speak a little
 
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.349 align:start position:0%
little bit uh did can you speak a little
louder

00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
louder
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
okay he was in your testimony you
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned um
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
you know the different aspects of the
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
election my question was
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
in the primary do you also think it's
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
important to get to know the candidates
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
and see what their policy
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
uh concerned diary and ideas are or are
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
you only concerned once it gets to a
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
general court in the election well
 
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
i'm involved in the political process
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
through and through but i think for
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
more youth who are the average voter um
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
i think they would be more inclined to
 
00:56:22.559 --> 00:56:22.950 align:start position:0%
i think they would be more inclined to
not

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
like you know um engage when there's
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
like a primary with a ton of candidates
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
because to them it would just be
 
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.390 align:start position:0%
because to them it would just be
confusing

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
but just having two candidates like one
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
republican one democrat
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
they have two options right in front of
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
them and they know the names and they
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
can just get to know them more on their
 
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.230 align:start position:0%
can just get to know them more on their
issues

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
rather than uh just having all the kind
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
of the noise of the background of the
 
00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:45.349 align:start position:0%
of the noise of the background of the
primary

00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
and they just kind of be more focused on
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
themselves in a sense
 
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
um so just really simplifying it and
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
just having two candidates throughout
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
the whole entire summer
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
while there has where they have school
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
off they would more likely pay attention
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
to the election thank you thank you
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney thank you madam
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you mr le credit for your
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh do you think or would you believe if
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
the primary were to be held in
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
june of the election year that would
 
00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:15.349 align:start position:0%
june of the election year that would
give

00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
give
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
political organizations on campuses in
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
more opportunities to hold election
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
related events
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
in the spring semester of the year
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
instead of really just having
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
primary and general election events on
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
campus in the fall semester
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh do you think that possibility for an
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
earlier primary and more activities
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
on campuses in that spring semester
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
could drive
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
more involvement on campuses when
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
students would otherwise not be paying
 
00:57:44.319 --> 00:57:45.670 align:start position:0%
students would otherwise not be paying
attention

00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i i certainly think so i mean as we
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
move out of winter and get into the
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
spring months more people are outside
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
um you know they're walking around
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
playing games on on the campus yard
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
and we usually table for our political
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
organizations outside
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
and when we do people walk by and they
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
just stop by and wonder what's going on
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
and if they you know wonder what's going
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
on in politics we would tell them hey
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
there'll be a primary in june
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
you know the weather's gonna mummer and
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
you can look all these candidates and
 
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:15.910 align:start position:0%
you can look all these candidates and
then

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
after that you had the whole entire
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
summer to think about just two
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know um so we just really kind of
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
again kind of use the warm weather to
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
get people kind of excited about it
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
um because during the summer we work a
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
lot so
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
when we have just two candidates rather
 
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
than like a million you know
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh be simpler for us to really hone down
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
on the issues
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%

hb 98 as presently written and suggest
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
to be deemed inexpedient to legislate
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
without further amendment
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
hb 98 proposes an amendment to chapter
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
2 chapter 655 it interacts
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
with two other sections of chapter 655
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
as presently written
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
to conflict with the rights of those
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
other candidates
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
who intend to have their name placed on
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
the ballot for the state general
 
01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:31.589 align:start position:0%

election
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
by means other than nomination by party
 
01:02:34.319 --> 01:02:35.190 align:start position:0%
by means other than nomination by party
primary

01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
as contemplated by six section 655
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
14a now section 655-40 states
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
as uh the sec deputy secretary of state
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
is noted
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
nomination papers shall be dated in the
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
year of the election
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
this sets the opening day for petition
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
as january the first
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
the second point is that section 655-43
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
states in paragraph one nomination
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%

primary
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
now it follows that by changing the date
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
of the primary from the second tuesday
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
in september
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
to the first tuesday in june the period
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
of time in which
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
such independent or alternative party
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
candidates might petition
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
is radically reduced to five months
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
much of which time is taken up with
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
inclement weather which inhibits
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
door-to-door petitioning
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
i respectfully recommend that hp 98 be
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
deemed inexpedient to legislate
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
as written and resubmitted with
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
revisions so
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
so as to amend section 655 40
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
and 655.43 to protect the first
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
amendment rights of
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
independent and alternative party
 
01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:54.549 align:start position:0%

you mr burt for testifying with us today
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
do you see anything in the proposed
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
legislation of hp 98 that removes
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
the write-in field from the ballot in
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
the general election
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh what i see is instead
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
as written the bill inhibits
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
political activity by restricting the
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
in which such uh independent or
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
alternative party candidates may
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
circulate their petitions
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
and as we know from our experience in
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
at the last uh general election cycle
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh where circulating petitions was
 
01:04:49.359 --> 01:04:50.470 align:start position:0%
uh where circulating petitions was
inhibited

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
inhibited
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
by uh the pandemic
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
the state had to defend litigation from
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
the libertarian party
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
to to which had the ultimately was
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
resolved by reducing the number of
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
signatures required
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless we have litigation there
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
and i do not
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
wish the taxpayers of this state to have
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
to pay for litigation unnecessarily
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
i would prefer that the bill be
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not asking regarding the
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
petitions my question is do you see
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
anything in the bill as proposed
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
that would remove the write-in field
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
from the general election ballot
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any questions
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you mr berg for
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%

bill

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
um and i'm having
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
difficulty um
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
with the computers you know first
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
meeting we were pretty seamless this
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
meeting is not so seamless so
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
i apologize if somebody could uh looks
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
like tina gilford has been
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
promoted and unmuted welcome welcome
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much i'm madam chair
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
um so i'm here today
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
um you have multiple bills in front of
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
to move the primary um i think
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
that after this last election cycle it
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
has become obvious
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
that the 45-day you acaba window is an
 
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.029 align:start position:0%
that the 45-day you acaba window is an
issue

01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
um and so moving the primary makes
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
sense however
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
this moving it to june does
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
have a wrinkle in it that i don't know
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
if it would affect other towns but would
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
definitely affect the town of derry
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
so in order to file um to
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
be on the primary um in instances where
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
you would file with
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
the town clerk which is the state
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
representative race
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
um you would need to file between the
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
first wednesday in march
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
and the friday of the following week to
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
declare your candidacy
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
most second tuesdays
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
in march for us are a town election
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
our town clerk is closed he's
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
at the um polls
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
um and i know that that's the case in
 
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
lots of towns so now you're kind of
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
cutting down the number of days
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
that people can actually sign up and
 
01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.109 align:start position:0%
that people can actually sign up and
most

01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
state reps that are currently sitting
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
are either in committees legislation
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
voting on bills
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
i i really think um signing up during
 
01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:53.990 align:start position:0%
i i really think um signing up during
march

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
march
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
is a really bad idea um
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
and with that i conclude what i have to
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
say very much for your testimony and
 
01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:02.390 align:start position:0%

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
date of the primary to this one
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%

personally i think august is fine we
 
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
definitely need
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
at least the first tuesday in september
 
01:08:39.839 --> 01:08:41.510 align:start position:0%
at least the first tuesday in september
um

01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's kind of funny where we
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
have the first in the nation primary and
 
01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
the last in the nation
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
primary basically in a presidential
 
01:08:49.199 --> 01:08:50.789 align:start position:0%
primary basically in a presidential
cycle

01:08:50.789 --> 01:08:50.799 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
we really do extend the season for
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
everyone um and it definitely takes a
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
lot of time
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
as an election official thank you
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you uh
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
um i understand your opposition to the
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
bill based off of the filing
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
from the first two weeks of march if the
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
bill have
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
is to be amended to make it filing in
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
the last two weeks of march or the last
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
week of march in the first week of
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
april uh would you still be opposed to a
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
june primary date
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
i believe so because i think that
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't leave a big enough window for
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
people to declare their candidacy
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
and then actually run um i think that
 
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
makes the window too small
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from
 
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0%

from you thank you for proceeding we did
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
wonder why you wanted to leave us so
 
01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.430 align:start position:0%
wonder why you wanted to leave us so
quickly

01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
it just it decided to it kicked me off
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
for some reason i
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
i don't really understand what the
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
message was on there was some zoom error
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
i guess but uh
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
but i did submit this to um to several
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
people like to the uh the chair the vice
 
01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:05.590 align:start position:0%
people like to the uh the chair the vice
chair

01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
um madam clerk and i submitted this
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
letter to
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
the three sponsors as well
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
so if you want to continue where you
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
left that would be great
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay um i'll be on the third paragraph
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
um it says i personally have been
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
involved in several campaigns for local
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
in national office in several states
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
and by comparison i have firsthand
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge and experience that the
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
earlier primary
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
the earlier the primary the better voter
 
01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.070 align:start position:0%
the earlier the primary the better voter
involvement

01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
an earlier primary allows the voter to
 
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
feel empowered with a sense of belonging
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
and responsibility of the issues
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
concerning them as time has afforded
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
them to learn the details
 
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
work them out and to have a spirited
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
discussion discussion with each
 
01:11:48.159 --> 01:11:49.830 align:start position:0%
discussion discussion with each
candidate

01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
candidates themselves benefit from an
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
earlier primary as it allows them to
 
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
convalesce with the citizens more often
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
which will lend
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
to a candidate's appreciation for the
 
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
concerns of the citizens
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
improving his or her attachment with
 
01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.910 align:start position:0%
improving his or her attachment with
them

01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
an earlier primary allows a candidate to
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
have more time to travel within the
 
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.030 align:start position:0%
have more time to travel within the
district

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
to reach as many voters as possible
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
which allows
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
for the citizen examination to occur to
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
afford them
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
more knowledge of the candidates i think
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
we all agree
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
that a better knowledge excuse me i
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
think we all agree that a better
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the issues a voter has
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
makes for a better informed voter
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
which will allow them to be part of
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
discussions with the candidate
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
that ultimately wins a later primary has
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
proven to make voters feel rushed to
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
fully understand
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
any candidate's position clearly
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
in conclusion my door knocking in voter
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
engagement experiences
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
before and after a primary have proven
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
to me that the citizens are much more
 
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
involved and knowledgeable about the
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
issues in
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
candidates after the primary for too
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
many months
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
before our current primary day in
 
01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.669 align:start position:0%
before our current primary day in
september

01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
september
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
the lack of focus by the general public
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
is discernible as too many candidates
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
and issues permeate in a process of time
 
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
only to sprint in the end in a rapid
 
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
pace disallowing voters to fully
 
01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate positions
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%

01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
august date on the
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%

01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
achieve some of your same
 
01:13:52.159 --> 01:13:55.430 align:start position:0%
achieve some of your same
goals

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
um i mean i think june would give it
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
more time for the summer months i'm
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
really focused
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
on the voter here um i think
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
for with respect to the voter that the
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
giving them time to uh
 
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
get to know the primary winners
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
especially during the summer months
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
when people do have leisure time and
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
they do have the cookouts and they do
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
um have more leisure discussions
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
in knowing who the primary winners are
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh is going to help the voters to
 
01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:28.790 align:start position:0%
uh is going to help the voters to
communicate

01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
communicate
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
about what the issues are so they can
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
make a wise decision so
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh would august be better this september
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%

01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
after the first monday eight to ten
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
years ago the federal justice department
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
passed a law to the states
 
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
the uo comma ballots in order to meet
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
45-day requirements ballots must be
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
mailed the same week it's the primary
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
but citizens overseas these ballots not
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
only need to be printed
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
but be put in the mail or sent out by
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
email depending on how a person requests
 
01:17:39.679 --> 01:17:40.630 align:start position:0%
email depending on how a person requests
it

01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
45 days before the november general
 
01:17:43.199 --> 01:17:45.030 align:start position:0%
45 days before the november general
election

01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
in 2010 the state had a situation of
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
being short on time
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office looked
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
ahead and said this short time period
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
would happen again it usually happens
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
every 10 years
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
but this next time will be in 2032
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
it would not be a whole week backing up
 
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
to the 45 days to get these
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
yojava ballots milled out
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
for an example the primary is on a
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
tuesday they need a wednesday and
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
thursday to count
 
01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
friday for recounts sometimes on a
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
saturday too
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
then the state needs to print mail the
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
yupa ballots
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
out the same week the state counts
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
ballots by first separating the counties
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
alphabetizing the counties then tally
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
the eight county races
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
ballots generally go out on that
 
01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.790 align:start position:0%
ballots generally go out on that
saturday

01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
saturday
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
so the secretary of state's office
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
suggests the following
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
keep the lords written but in the event
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
to meet the 45-day federal requirement
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the europa ballots to be mailed out
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
the same week as the primary
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
primary date should be moved back one
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
week earlier
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%

question

01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
don't you just
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
have a bill that says the state primary
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
election will be held on the first
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
tuesday in september
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
so that it's consistent uh every year
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
i will note that deputy scanlon is
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
asking to speak on this bill
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair is there a concern
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
that a lack of a pattern
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
will can be confusing
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
i find patterns of dates
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
to be you know very important and
 
01:20:59.910 --> 01:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps that's something that mr skin
 
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
address exactly
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
there is a there is a way the count back
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
is but
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%

uh being a sponsor um
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
this bill i i would consider
 
01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
housekeeping you know
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
with our statute calls for the state
 
01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
primary to be on the second tuesday
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
in september and in most years or most
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
election cycles
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
that provides us a 10-day window
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
from the date of the primary within
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
which to certify the vote
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh have an opportunity for candidates to
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
request recounts
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
conduct those recounts uh and prepare
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
the ballots either
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
physically or electronically so that we
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
can meet the 45-day deadline
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
that occurs saturday at midnight
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
10 days later there are situations
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
every so many years it's not frequent
 
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
but it does occur
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
where we lose a week in that window of
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
time between the primary and the general
 
01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:29.750 align:start position:0%
time between the primary and the general
election

01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does is simply allows
 
01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:33.990 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does is simply allows
us

01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
to maintain that 10-day window to get
 
01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
the job done
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
as opposed to having three or four days
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
after the election
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
to make it happen by you know creating a
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
formula that
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
allows us to move the primary
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
one week earlier in september um that's
 
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
all the bill does
 
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's like i said it's it's
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
housekeeping it
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
just allows us the opportunity to get
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
the job done uh
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't move the date of the primary uh
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
at all beyond that
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
and with that i would be happy to try
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
and answer questions
 
01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:14.390 align:start position:0%
and answer questions
questions

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
representative mcgregor thank you
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh there a reason why
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
you didn't just simply make
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
the date the first
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
um the first
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just keeping with
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
tradition of the second tuesday in
 
01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.750 align:start position:0%
tradition of the second tuesday in
september

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
september
 
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
um uh you know it's something that we
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
have been able to do
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
um you know to do anything beyond that i
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
think is it
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
is a policy decision of the legislature
 
01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.030 align:start position:0%
is a policy decision of the legislature
um

01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
and that's reflected in the bills that
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
the rare occasion that this happens and
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's happened in the past
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
this has only happened once in the past
 
01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:22.950 align:start position:0%
this has only happened once in the past
and

01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
that one that at one time was also the
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
first year that the 45-day deadline
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
was a federal requirement and
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
we were able to meet that deadline
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
at the time i believe we had to get
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
creative in doing that by sending out
 
01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
um uh uh absentee ballots
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
where uh the voter uh would write in the
 
01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.390 align:start position:0%
where uh the voter uh would write in the
names

01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
names
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
of the candidates that they wanted to
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
support certainly that was not ideal
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh it met the it did meet the technical
 
01:24:58.239 --> 01:24:59.270 align:start position:0%
uh it met the it did meet the technical
requirements

01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
um so we were not in violation
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
but that's the only time that we were
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
faced with that situation
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
it may have been 2010 i have to go back
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
and look
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
but we do know that this situation or
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
that situation
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
will occur again uh in the future even
 
01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
though it may be uh 10 years from now
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
thank you follow-up representative thank
 
01:25:22.639 --> 01:25:23.830 align:start position:0%
thank you follow-up representative thank

01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%

01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you if either one of the last two
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
bills we heard
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh sort of passed then that would take
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
care of the
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
issue and this bill would not be
 
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.510 align:start position:0%
issue and this bill would not be
responded

01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry madam chair i did not hear
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
that question
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
i'll speak a little louder
 
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
if either the last two bills that we
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
just heard
 
01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
would have passed they would take care
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
of this issue that this bill
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct i mean if you pass one of
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
the other two bills
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh that that were heard before this one
 
01:26:06.239 --> 01:26:06.950 align:start position:0%
uh that that were heard before this one
uh

01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:31.310 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:34.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:48.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm just uh i just
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to note that the sound quality
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
out of the committee room is um is
 
01:26:55.679 --> 01:26:56.310 align:start position:0%
out of the committee room is um is
marginal

01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
marginal
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
and often in inaudible last week it was
 
01:26:59.520 --> 01:26:59.990 align:start position:0%
and often in inaudible last week it was
perfect

01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
but something's gone something must have
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
changed just wanted to register that so
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
i i'm sorry i could just barely hear you
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
for instance madam chair thank you
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you pam this is problematic we
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
have an 11 o'clock hearing it is 11
 
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.590 align:start position:0%
have an 11 o'clock hearing it is 11
o'clock

01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to start that public hearing
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
um on time but i am
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps at our testimony on that
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
it will not be the entire half hour and
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we can have somebody from tech
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
support down here
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
i think in the first instance the
 
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
microphone is our problem and i'm
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
hearing a little echo
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
we've been in the room as we sit here
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
and i have for a
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
little bit so i can something else just
 
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
changes anybody else hearing a slight
 
01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:49.110 align:start position:0%
changes anybody else hearing a slight
echo

01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
i will call scott kelly and he'll he'll
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
be there soon
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay um but we do we do have another
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill to take up
 
01:28:01.229 --> 01:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
um we i am closing the hearing on hb
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
537 and i am opening the hearing
 
01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
on hb 222
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
this is a bill relative to political
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
party access
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
to a list of absentee ballots um
 
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
we have attendees in
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
this and representative alexander
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
will be introducing it and
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
if someone can promote them to a campus
 
01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you madam chair um
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you members of the committee
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is uh joe
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
alexander i'm a representative from
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
hillsborough district six which is the
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
town of goffstown
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
um i'm here to present hb 223 which is
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
relative to the political party access
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
to the list of absentee ballot requests
 
01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:16.390 align:start position:0%
to the list of absentee ballot requests
so

01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
i believe this is a straightforward bill
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
that just codifies the current practice
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
in state law
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
currently only candidates for statewide
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
office can request a list of absentee
 
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
ballot requests
 
01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
um these statewide candidates can
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
request the list and then designate
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
their respective political party as
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
their agent and the party can pay for
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
the subscription
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
by removing the middle man from the
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
process this would allow parties
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
themselves to have
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
access to absentee ballot requests via
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
of subscription
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
without having to get a sign off from a
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
statewide candidate
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
um i believe this simplifies the current
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
process and law and ensures that a
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
political party
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
without incumbent statewide election
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
official up on the ballot
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
in a particular election cycle can still
 
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
get absentee ballot
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
um subscription without having to uh be
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
named the agent of a primary campaign
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
um so i believe this just um
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
this this is a pretty straightforward
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
bill and i'm happy to take any questions
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
 
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative thank you good morning
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
representative alexander
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i believe has only two
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
legal political parties
 
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh i think that at least four percent of
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
candidates previous election would be
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
the only only legal political parties
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
the question was there are currently two
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
legal political parties in the state of
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
any other entity be able to obtain a
 
01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.350 align:start position:0%
any other entity be able to obtain a
list

01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
um i believe any current statewide
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
candidate can
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
obtain the list but if if there is a
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
i mean as far as i know um if there's a
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
candidate that is a statewide candidate
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
for office
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
um they're allowed to obtain a list so
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what party or what
 
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
election

01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair just a
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
very simple question uh when the
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
candidates ask for
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot lists they're provided
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
the address of the voters who've
 
01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
requested absentee ballots
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
your legislation doesn't ask for that um
 
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:44.390 align:start position:0%
your legislation doesn't ask for that um
it's

01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
part of you know public information on
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
the checklist i'm just wondering
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
um that's that's a great question and i
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
welcome the committee if they would like
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
to add that information onto the bill
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
i believe the sponsors would certainly
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
be okay with that
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
for that the
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
representative so bill asks for the
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
voter id number
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
and most major parties have databases
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
of voters already obviously include
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
their voter id number
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
so yes it would probably be sparkling
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
bill but
 
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
it is an effective way to already
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you
 
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%

to this bill
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
um and if it's worth to speak somebody
 
01:32:51.199 --> 01:32:52.229 align:start position:0%
um and if it's worth to speak somebody
else

01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%

this
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
these are decisions that the legislature
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
should make but i just wanted to let
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
the committee know that any candidate
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
can go to any town clerk in their
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
elective district and request
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%

01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
of voters that have requested an
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot or
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
a person bearing a notarized
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
letter uh representing the candidate can
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
obtain a list
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
in the case of a statewide candidate
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh that that individual or
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
their representative with a notarized
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
letter can request a subscription
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
from the secretary of state's office to
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
obtain the statewide
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
absentee voter list and the information
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
that would be provided is that
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
information that is in
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 223 uh the key there
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
is the voter id number if
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
if the candidate has that number then
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
they can match it up to all the
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
information that is on
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
the statewide centralized voter data
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
based checklist that they can also
 
01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.629 align:start position:0%
based checklist that they can also
obtain

01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
obtain
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
for a fee the subscription fee is two
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
for that candidate so what this bill
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
does is
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
extends the ability to obtain the
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
to the political parties and with that
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
online you want to see
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
your view thank you for that information
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlan
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who would like to
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
speak in regards to
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
223 relating to the ability of voters
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me relating to obtaining
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
lists of absentee ballot as well
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing no further testimony so i'm
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
going to close the hearing on hb 228.2
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
223 our next hearing starts at 11 30
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
on hb 505. uh
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
tech support is here we're going to try
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
and get our technical issues the
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
committee room
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
will be going on mute and see everybody
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
sorry i was muted myself yes i can hear
 
01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.950 align:start position:0%
sorry i was muted myself yes i can hear
you

01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
i can hear you
 
01:40:36.159 --> 01:40:39.270 align:start position:0%
i can hear you
here

01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe maybe speak say a longer
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
sentence because i think sometimes um
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
it kind of cuts out over a little time
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
okay i'm just sliding down here at this
 
01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:51.270 align:start position:0%
okay i'm just sliding down here at this
table

01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
does it sound as good that sounds nice
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
and clear yes
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
how about right here in this corner this
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
well you know it cut out if you you said
 
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
right here in this corner and then if
 
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
you said anything after that i'm not
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
sure i did hear it
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
how about sitting right here on this
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
left-hand corner um
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
you're very fine here yeah i heard that
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
whole sentence
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
and how about the chairs microphones
 
01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:37.189 align:start position:0%
and how about the chairs microphones
that's

01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's the clearest and loudest of all
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
did i now see
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative griffin i don't know just
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
there you sort of cut out
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's moving your head or
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
what might be causing that microphone
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
because they're so we did so the
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
difference last week we only had the
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
three microphones this is
 
01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
the difference right it is well you have
 
01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:08.390 align:start position:0%
the difference right it is well you have
one

01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
you have one two we have three which is
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
what we had last week
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
i remember being surprised that three
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah so we added the mics with the
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
chair because it's nice and
 
01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:25.350 align:start position:0%
chair because it's nice and
clear

01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
so each chair has a microphone
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
is it possible that that microphone is
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
causing some
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
feedback with other blackboards if it's
 
01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:36.550 align:start position:0%
feedback with other blackboards if it's
better

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
no it shouldn't be called name okay have
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
you begun to feedback
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
there has been a little echo in here for
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
20 minutes or so i think nope
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
not in their head when i said i'm
 
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
hannah do you hear an echo from
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
the room did i
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
not i'm not sure that i did i mean the
 
01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:04.070 align:start position:0%
not i'm not sure that i did i mean the
sound

01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
sound
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
was was definitely not great whether i
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
heard an echo i don't know but
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
scott where you were talking just there
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
that that corner that left hand corner
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
of the table
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
and representative griffin is not a
 
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
hundred percent clear
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
all the time you know you were when you
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
were at her mic but i don't know
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
that was a clearly brief little can you
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
hear me though exactly
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
so if it's going on for any prolonged
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
period you're having problems with it
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
well just what you said there i think
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
you really need to um
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
never turn your head but it's hard for
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
me to see if you are turning your head
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
just there
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
you sounded fine but um a little while
 
01:43:48.159 --> 01:43:48.870 align:start position:0%
you sounded fine but um a little while
ago

01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
and it does seem as though it could be
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
um what about if you just take this away
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
we try to do can you hear from the other
 
01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:26.070 align:start position:0%
we try to do can you hear from the other
mics

01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
all right but i'm not hearing committee
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
members and they actually do more
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
do

01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
this one seemed to be working it was the
 
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
ones on this side of the room that we
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
were having problems with
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
right now i'm hearing representative
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
griffin very well and i'm not hearing
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead and say something more okay
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
over here
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
for uh if maybe just keep talking
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
i'm sitting over here on the left side
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
of the room
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that sounds fine that sounds fine
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
but there are two microphones over here
 
01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:12.790 align:start position:0%
but there are two microphones over here
now

01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
so so what happens when you go over to
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
where representative
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
berry is or where natalie was testified
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
well she didn't have a microphone when
 
01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
she first sat down at the testifying
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
table but then when she did have one she
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
but it was interesting when somebody
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
moved the mic and spoke
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
you could really hear the mic picking it
 
01:45:46.639 --> 01:45:47.270 align:start position:0%
you could really hear the mic picking it
up

01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
but when someone was moving the other
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
mic and moving it it was
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%

01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
how about this corner here that's nice
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:12.870 align:start position:0%

scott when i joined this it asks me if i
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
want to join with computer audio
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%

turned off the whole time is there any
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
now if it matters that conversation on
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
the left-hand side of the room is very
 
01:48:11.679 --> 01:48:12.790 align:start position:0%
the left-hand side of the room is very
garbled

01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
garbled
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:38.950 align:start position:0%

griffin i have made you a co-host and i
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have um
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
regained your so we'll see how it goes
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
it seems to be responding much better
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:59.350 --> 01:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of time to everything
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
today that was not happening last week
 
01:49:05.590 --> 01:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
i wonder if this system just with the
 
01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:06.229 align:start position:0%
i wonder if this system just with the
more

01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
committee meetings going on is having
 
01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
like problems
 
01:49:26.229 --> 01:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
i can but that side of the room is not
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
good it's i mean i guess maybe because
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
of the other conversation
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
i'm getting the word that you're you're
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
not loud on the mic in the center table
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
um it's difficult with the other
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
conversation i can hear you
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
but i i'm hearing that garbled
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
conversation behind you so it's kind of
 
01:51:02.229 --> 01:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
kind of confusing
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's not great it's it's light and a
 
01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:47.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
i'm picking up other conversations more
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
than you you're you're you're faint
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
i have a clear voice do you want me to
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
you're just you were just cutting out at
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
the mic i don't know if it's because you
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
were moving
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
so i'm over here in the conference room
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
checking the sound
 
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to see if i'm coming
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
i hear you it's not really loud and
 
01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:24.070 align:start position:0%
i hear you it's not really loud and
clear

01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
but i hear the mic by representative
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
rosian to see if you can pick me up here
 
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know much louder much clearer
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
that's much
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
better than mikey microphone
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
this is this is softer than the the
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
tarosian mic
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
this this seems to be lower but i can
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
hear you
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
so but you could hear me
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
yes i could i can hear you
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:04.719 align:start position:0%
that is not good sitting at the
 
01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
you are you are cutting out you are not
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
good there on the the left
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
my left hand side of the room as i move
 
01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
up here um
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
if representative mooney moved up here
 
01:53:29.189 --> 01:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
would you be able to hear her
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
yes that would that's an excellent spot
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
right there that's a good standard
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
mike's going of course the chairs mike
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
is up there
 
01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
so once again we're back to this room
 
01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
this side seems to be a little clearer
 
01:53:45.669 --> 01:53:45.679 align:start position:0%
and the other side is having problems
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
um so yeah erosion mike was good
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and the the prudent o'brien maybe
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
mike was good but the barry mike um was
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
not so good
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
all right and i'm over here and now i'm
 
01:53:58.870 --> 01:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
probably being
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
picked up by the cheers lincoln can you
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%

01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
yes i can sure
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
all right the next i might wait pam
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative abramson said he would be
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
a few minutes late for the 11 30
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
he was going to introduce it
 
01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:32.290 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:32.290 --> 01:54:35.510 align:start position:0%

01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative abramson for 505.
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
he's the sponsor the other sponsor isn't
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
so who do i talk to for my little name

i know you should have an eighth time
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
around somebody throw mine away for two
 
01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:00.870 align:start position:0%
around somebody throw mine away for two
years

01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
we're aware of the nameplate issue it's
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
just that it hasn't
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
been a top priority um but it will be
 
01:55:20.159 --> 01:55:20.629 align:start position:0%
been a top priority um but it will be
done

01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
and it's they probably have the old ones
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
and some
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
feel right they're all we do definitely
 
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
keep them from previous years
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
um but they're as you can imagine there
 
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
are a lot of them
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:26.840 --> 01:57:08.830 align:start position:0%

from

02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:09:12.629 --> 02:09:12.639 align:start position:0%
epsom and uh if i had known you were
 
02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
going to put me on video and not just
 
02:09:16.229 --> 02:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
audio i would have put on a tie
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
i apologize um
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
so uh i i'm happy to kick this off
 
02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
because i was the
 
02:09:26.430 --> 02:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
i was a member of the house from 2011 to
 
02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:27.990 align:start position:0%
i was a member of the house from 2011 to
2016

02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
2016
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
and i was the first prime sponsor of a
 
02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
bill very similar to this
 
02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
um during that time so i'm very familiar
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
with the issue and i
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
can answer questions that you may have
 
02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:41.430 align:start position:0%
can answer questions that you may have
um

02:09:41.430 --> 02:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:44.069 --> 02:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
so this is one of the very what i assume
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
is the very few
 
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh completely non-partisan bills that
 
02:09:49.109 --> 02:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
your committee
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
will deal with this is not uh does not
 
02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:52.310 align:start position:0%
will deal with this is not uh does not
give

02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
give
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
any particular advantage to any
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
particular party
 
02:09:59.669 --> 02:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
um it's it's an idea that just improves
 
02:10:01.830 --> 02:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
the experience of the voters
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
and in particular it makes sure that
 
02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
every vote
 
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
counts that that every voters uh
 
02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
what they want to have happen is
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
expressed and
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
and is part of the becomes part of the
 
02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:15.990 align:start position:0%
and is part of the becomes part of the
count

02:10:15.990 --> 02:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
count
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
um it is it's the bill is very simple
 
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require any new the structure
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
of the ballot doesn't change the
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
machines don't change the accounting
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
procedure doesn't change
 
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bill it's extremely
 
02:10:32.709 --> 02:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
short uh the only thing that changes
 
02:10:32.719 --> 02:10:33.589 align:start position:0%
short uh the only thing that changes
slightly

02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
slightly
 
02:10:35.669 --> 02:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
are the instructions that are written on
 
02:10:37.589 --> 02:10:37.599 align:start position:0%
the ballot
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
so to give you an example of what
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
the bill would do um
 
02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
and and the other thing is it doesn't it
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't make
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
a difference in any kind of head-to-head
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
race uh you know if you have race for
 
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
governor and there are two people
 
02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:55.270 align:start position:0%
governor and there are two people
running

02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
running
 
02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
this makes no difference there's no
 
02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
change in the
 
02:11:01.589 --> 02:11:01.599 align:start position:0%
effect of this bill it is
 
02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
it is uh makes a slight difference in in
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
races where
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh multiple people are running sometimes
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
for multiple seats
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
or it could simply be multiple people
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
running for one seat
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
so um to to illustrate what the bill
 
02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:16.950 align:start position:0%
so um to to illustrate what the bill
does

02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
let me talk about my the district that i
 
02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:21.270 align:start position:0%
let me talk about my the district that i
represented

02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
represented
 
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
when i was in the house and that's a
 
02:11:25.189 --> 02:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
district of two towns epsom in
 
02:11:25.199 --> 02:11:26.709 align:start position:0%
district of two towns epsom in
pittsfield

02:11:26.709 --> 02:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
pittsfield
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
and had two reps in those for those two
 
02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:30.790 align:start position:0%
and had two reps in those for those two
towns

02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
towns
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
um currently this is uh representative
 
02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
allard and close
 
02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
are the are your representatives from
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
this particular district
 
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
and um so typically there before
 
02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
in the general election there before
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
candidates uh two democrats and two
 
02:11:49.270 --> 02:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
republicans for these two seats
 
02:11:51.910 --> 02:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
and uh let's consider the ways that
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
voters might vote for these
 
02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
for these four candidates so first of
 
02:11:58.390 --> 02:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
all someone can skip this
 
02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
this election all together right they
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
could leave it blank
 
02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
we don't have any problem now doing that
 
02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh more
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
more typically people vote for two of
 
02:12:08.069 --> 02:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
the candidates
 
02:12:09.990 --> 02:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
um often they vote for the same party
 
02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
but not always sometimes they might pick
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
one from each party
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
so uh this this um
 
02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't change that in any way um
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
what about if someone votes for a single
 
02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:24.550 align:start position:0%
what about if someone votes for a single
candidate

02:12:24.550 --> 02:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
right so they pick one out of the four
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
this this
 
02:12:30.310 --> 02:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh bill doesn't change that in any way
 
02:12:32.629 --> 02:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
and this is not that uncommon i mean we
 
02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
even have a name for that we call that
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
bullet voting
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
and and it's currently perfectly
 
02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
acceptable it would be acceptable
 
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh nothing would change if this bill
 
02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:43.430 align:start position:0%
uh nothing would change if this bill
passed

02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
similarly um let's suppose somebody for
 
02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:47.510 align:start position:0%
similarly um let's suppose somebody for
whatever

02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
reason they might have they voted for
 
02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
all four candidates
 
02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
well currently we don't count that right
 
02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:54.149 align:start position:0%
well currently we don't count that right
we

02:12:54.149 --> 02:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
we throw that out and say that's an
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
overvote you can't do that
 
02:13:00.550 --> 02:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
um but supposing we did count it which
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
would happen under this bill
 
02:13:04.149 --> 02:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't affect the outcome in any
 
02:13:05.830 --> 02:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
way right because a vote
 
02:13:07.669 --> 02:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
there are four candidates and a vote for
 
02:13:09.030 --> 02:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
all four
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
everybody's vote goes up by one it
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the outcome
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
but the only thing that would change is
 
02:13:17.350 --> 02:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
let's suppose that someone voted for
 
02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:17.750 align:start position:0%
let's suppose that someone voted for
three

02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
of the four candidates now currently
 
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
that gets thrown out right we call that
 
02:13:25.750 --> 02:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
an overvote
 
02:13:27.990 --> 02:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
and and that person's vote is not
 
02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.510 align:start position:0%
and and that person's vote is not
counted

02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
counted
 
02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
but it's clear to anyone looking at that
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
vote and looking at the ballot what that
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
person is trying to it to express
 
02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
right that person who voted for three
 
02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
out of four
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
says i don't want number four right i'm
 
02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
i'm voting against
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
number four i dislike number four and i
 
02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
don't care
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
between the other three and so what this
 
02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
bill would do
 
02:13:55.510 --> 02:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
is say let's count that that's a
 
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
perfectly valid
 
02:14:00.550 --> 02:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh sentiment a voter can easily think
 
02:14:03.669 --> 02:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh this is a person i don't like and and
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
want to vote against them
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
and doesn't want to express an opinion
 
02:14:09.189 --> 02:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
among others
 
02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
right there's no there's nothing
 
02:14:12.950 --> 02:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
theoretically wrong with counting that
 
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
vote there's nothing practically wrong
 
02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
with with counting that vote
 
02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's exactly the same thing as a bullet
 
02:14:20.950 --> 02:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
vote and i wish i had a good
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
name for it like bullet vote i don't
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
know what you would call it i'm not that
 
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
great at marketing
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
just you know voting against one person
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
would essentially is is exactly the same
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
as voting for
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
one person in such a circumstance right
 
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason why we shouldn't
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
count that and we shouldn't
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
um listen to what that voter
 
02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
wants to say and so that's what this
 
02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
bill does this bill says
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
we should count that kind of vote right
 
02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:54.390 align:start position:0%
we should count that kind of vote right
there's

02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
it eliminates over voting and it it
 
02:14:59.589 --> 02:14:59.599 align:start position:0%
listens to every voter
 
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
now i actually and i recommend this
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
really to all of you on the election
 
02:15:04.079 --> 02:15:04.629 align:start position:0%
really to all of you on the election
committee

02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
is is to participate in a wreak and
 
02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:09.189 align:start position:0%
is is to participate in a wreak and
recounts

02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
recounts
 
02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
and look at ballots because you learn a
 
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
lot about voting
 
02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
simply observing ballots and i once
 
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
observed the situation in a
 
02:15:19.030 --> 02:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
that was similar to what i just
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
described and that was
 
02:15:25.109 --> 02:15:25.119 align:start position:0%
um i was in i was watching a recount for
 
02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
state rep in hudson hudson pelham
 
02:15:30.229 --> 02:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
this is a huge district i think there
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
are 13 reps in that district
 
02:15:35.109 --> 02:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
and it was they had a close election and
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
it was being recounted and we came upon
 
02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
a ballot
 
02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
where someone had voted for for every
 
02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
single democrat on the ballot it voted
 
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
straight party line all the democrats
 
02:15:49.990 --> 02:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
but when it came to
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
state rep they had voted for all the
 
02:15:53.589 --> 02:15:53.599 align:start position:0%
democratic state reps
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
but they had also voted for one
 
02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:57.109 align:start position:0%
but they had also voted for one
republican

02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
republican
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
right and so what happened was
 
02:16:03.270 --> 02:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
that ballot was thrown out when it was
 
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely clear to every single person
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
looking at that ballot what did this
 
02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:09.109 align:start position:0%
looking at that ballot what did this
voter

02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
voter
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know what was in this voter's mind
 
02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
because clearly this voter was a
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
democrat and wanted democrats to win
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
but in the case of state rep they were
 
02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
maybe friends with or neighbors with or
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
knew one particular republican candidate
 
02:16:27.189 --> 02:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
and they liked that person too you know
 
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
this perfectly human sentiment it's
 
02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:31.109 align:start position:0%
this perfectly human sentiment it's
important

02:16:31.109 --> 02:16:31.119 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
and why not let them express that so
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
that's what this
 
02:16:37.669 --> 02:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh that's what this uh procedure this
 
02:16:40.389 --> 02:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
this bill house bill 505 would do
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
i highly recommend that you vote it off
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
yes and i'm happy to answer questions
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
 
02:16:48.719 --> 02:16:52.950 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
members

02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:55.990 --> 02:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcdonald thank
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
good morning mr um
 
02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
i've sat in on a number of recounts over
 
02:17:04.629 --> 02:17:04.639 align:start position:0%
the years as
 
02:17:07.669 --> 02:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
you've indicated you have and in
 
02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
multi-candidate field the tabulation is
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
always a challenge
 
02:17:14.309 --> 02:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
you know you're going through that um do
 
02:17:14.319 --> 02:17:14.629 align:start position:0%
you know you're going through that um do
you

02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:17:16.469 --> 02:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
want to see additional tabulating
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
problems counting problems
 
02:17:20.709 --> 02:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
initially with this uh this proposed
 
02:17:20.719 --> 02:17:22.309 align:start position:0%
initially with this uh this proposed
system

02:17:22.309 --> 02:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes i can hear you and
 
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald and welcome to
 
02:17:32.070 --> 02:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
the house you might say
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
because i know this is your first term
 
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:40.230 --> 02:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think so the answer is no i mean
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
first of all the same machine that
 
02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
counts votes
 
02:17:46.950 --> 02:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
currently and and um would simply be
 
02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:47.750 align:start position:0%
currently and and um would simply be
programmed

02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
programmed
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
not to throw out overvotes right it
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
would just count every
 
02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
every mark on the ballot and so
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
the machine is no different many places
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
use machines
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
in cases where they don't use machines
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
and they just do thick marks like you do
 
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
in a recount
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
they would simply keep basically read
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
off all the names and make the tick
 
02:18:08.469 --> 02:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
marks in the
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
in the appropriate places and so i i
 
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
don't foresee any any real difference
 
02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions from
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
committee members in the room
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
02:18:22.709 --> 02:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
so you know i heard your testimony that
 
02:18:28.639 --> 02:18:29.589 align:start position:0%
so you know i heard your testimony that
if

02:18:29.589 --> 02:18:29.599 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:18:31.110 --> 02:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know you vote for three of the four
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
you're obviously
 
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
making it known that that one candidate
 
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
you didn't vote for
 
02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
is um you're voting against that person
 
02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
but but under the present
 
02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
system you can still do that you just
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
can't vote for as many people but you
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
could still
 
02:18:49.110 --> 02:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
vote in essence not for that
 
02:18:52.150 --> 02:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
candidate so i'm a little i don't quite
 
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
completely follow what
 
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
what the goal is here to to me this
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
almost seems a little bit like ranked
 
02:18:59.509 --> 02:18:59.519 align:start position:0%
voting i know you don't get a chance
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a run-off but
 
02:19:02.790 --> 02:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
so maybe you can clarify a little bit
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
more for me how that how that would make
 
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
a difference between whether you voted
 
02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
for two people when you were voting
 
02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
against somebody you voted for three to
 
02:19:08.719 --> 02:19:09.110 align:start position:0%
against somebody you voted for three to
vote

02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
vote against them um thank you very much
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
for the question representative
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
so let's let's take your particular
 
02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:17.830 align:start position:0%
so let's let's take your particular
example

02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
i want to vote against number four and i
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
have no preference between one two and
 
02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:23.830 align:start position:0%
have no preference between one two and
three

02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
in the current system it's up to me
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
to try to guess which ones of one two
 
02:19:31.669 --> 02:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
and three
 
02:19:34.709 --> 02:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
will be the most popular and vote for
 
02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
those two
 
02:19:39.190 --> 02:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
right so i have to guess that that the
 
02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:39.830 align:start position:0%
right so i have to guess that that the
voters

02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
voters
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
are are gonna like one and two better
 
02:19:43.830 --> 02:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
than they like three
 
02:19:47.110 --> 02:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
right so that i can i can
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
make my vote um work
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
basically so so the voter is required to
 
02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:54.070 align:start position:0%
basically so so the voter is required to
somehow

02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
02:19:57.429 --> 02:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
have a handle on the election and
 
02:19:59.670 --> 02:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
and make that choice and i don't know
 
02:20:01.830 --> 02:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
how a voter necessarily knows those kind
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
of things
 
02:20:06.630 --> 02:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
um and so so the voter who wants to vote
 
02:20:07.830 --> 02:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
against four
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
can't just express that they have to
 
02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
vote against for
 
02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
and against somebody else right and and
 
02:20:14.080 --> 02:20:14.389 align:start position:0%
and against somebody else right and and
the

02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
the most practical thing that they
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
should do is
 
02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
figure out which somebody else is least
 
02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
likely to win
 
02:20:23.429 --> 02:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
and vote against them you know because
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
they're they're trying to make sure
 
02:20:26.950 --> 02:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
four doesn't win but they're gonna have
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
to do the same thing to three
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
and so why should the voter be required
 
02:20:32.479 --> 02:20:32.950 align:start position:0%
and so why should the voter be required
to

02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
do that the voter who wants to bullet
 
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
vote one person
 
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
um doesn't have to do that they can
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
easily express what they want to express
 
02:20:43.830 --> 02:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
but the vote voter who wants to sort of
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
bullet against one person
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
can't express that and i think it's a
 
02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:49.349 align:start position:0%
can't express that and i think it's a
perfectly

02:20:49.349 --> 02:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
perfectly
 
02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
natural thing that a voter might want to
 
02:20:52.630 --> 02:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
do i
 
02:20:56.469 --> 02:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
i've done it myself sometimes um
 
02:20:59.910 --> 02:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
so so that that's it your
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
current system requires the voter to
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
be politically aware in a way that that
 
02:21:09.750 --> 02:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you follow-up representative thank
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
if all of this so if i hear it correctly
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's it sort of gives the voter
 
02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
a chance to second guess um
 
02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
in in essence he's he's voting more just
 
02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
against that person than he is
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily trying to vote for the the
 
02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:31.750 align:start position:0%
necessarily trying to vote for the the
two

02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:21:34.469 --> 02:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
best people out of the four is that am i
 
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you for the question so
 
02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:41.349 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you for the question so
again

02:21:41.349 --> 02:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:21:44.469 --> 02:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm postulating we have a voter
 
02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
who really hates one one particular
 
02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
candidate would not want to see that
 
02:21:50.309 --> 02:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
person win
 
02:21:52.230 --> 02:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
but among the other three they're okay
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
they don't um
 
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
they don't have a strong preference
 
02:21:56.080 --> 02:21:56.790 align:start position:0%
they don't have a strong preference
right

02:21:56.790 --> 02:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:21:58.630 --> 02:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
and so you might say well just pick two
 
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know what find your two favorites
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
you may not have a big preference but
 
02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
why not just vote for them
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
but but if by doing that you allow
 
02:22:11.110 --> 02:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
a candidate number four you know because
 
02:22:12.710 --> 02:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
you didn't vote for three
 
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
candidate four beat number three
 
02:22:19.349 --> 02:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
well now you're unhappy you see what i
 
02:22:19.359 --> 02:22:19.910 align:start position:0%
well now you're unhappy you see what i
mean

02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
so so it's it's makes it tough for that
 
02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:24.309 align:start position:0%
so so it's it's makes it tough for that
voter

02:22:24.309 --> 02:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
voter
 
02:22:26.469 --> 02:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
to to express what they want to express
 
02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
and have it count
 
02:22:31.990 --> 02:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason for it i mean
 
02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't see an objection to this
 
02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:35.270 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't see an objection to this
procedure

02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
right um other than it's not you know
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's not the way we've always done it
 
02:22:40.469 --> 02:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's the only
 
02:22:42.389 --> 02:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
the only thing we're trying to overcome
 
02:22:42.399 --> 02:22:43.670 align:start position:0%
the only thing we're trying to overcome
here

02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
02:22:46.870 --> 02:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
i see a panelist has a handout uh
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative hamlet
 
02:22:58.630 --> 02:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
do you have a question yes thank you
 
02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
02:23:03.190 --> 02:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
um so representative mcguire um does
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
this system
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
guarantee that the winner will get over
 
02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:07.910 align:start position:0%
guarantee that the winner will get over
50

02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
50
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
of the vote so i'm trying to understand
 
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
the difference between
 
02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
this system and ranked choice voting
 
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
whereas in ranked choice voting
 
02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
i think it it guarantees that the winner
 
02:23:20.309 --> 02:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
will get
 
02:23:22.389 --> 02:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
you know a majority or over 50 percent
 
02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
of the vote so does this system
 
02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
assure that the winner would get over 50
 
02:23:30.550 --> 02:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question uh
 
02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:31.429 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question uh
representative

02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
and in my little example of two people
 
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
running for four
 
02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
seats of course that's true um
 
02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
but in but in let's say
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
let's take something more bigger like
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
like the presidential primary
 
02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
you've got 24 people running for one
 
02:23:51.359 --> 02:23:52.469 align:start position:0%
you've got 24 people running for one
position

02:23:52.469 --> 02:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
you see in in that case um
 
02:23:57.990 --> 02:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
the answer is no right because because
 
02:24:00.150 --> 02:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
the winner is frequently somebody with
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
30 of the votes or something like that
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
so the only reason that rank choice
 
02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:06.710 align:start position:0%
so the only reason that rank choice
voting

02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
creates what you called the somebody got
 
02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:09.830 align:start position:0%
creates what you called the somebody got
50

02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
50
 
02:24:12.630 --> 02:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
is because it starts to throw away votes
 
02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:13.030 align:start position:0%
is because it starts to throw away votes
right

02:24:13.030 --> 02:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
somebody liked somebody who was got a
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
very small vote
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
well they changed that vote into uh
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
a different preference right so so so
 
02:24:24.070 --> 02:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
they keep throwing away
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
candidates until somebody gets 50 but
 
02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
this just simply counts and um if you
 
02:24:33.190 --> 02:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
took something like the presidential
 
02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:34.309 align:start position:0%
took something like the presidential
primary

02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
primary
 
02:24:37.349 --> 02:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh it may be that the the winner gets 50
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily thank you further
 
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members

02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:28.150 align:start position:0%
representing hampton hampton falls in
sieber

02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
sieber
 
02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh introducing housewell 505 which is
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
called approval voting but it's just
 
02:25:33.110 --> 02:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
02:25:35.190 --> 02:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
it's a big fight or work for we don't
 
02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
throughout speed battle
 
02:25:42.150 --> 02:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
i come from seabrook and i felt folks
 
02:25:45.190 --> 02:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
learned to vote the first time and
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh i just sat down at a table just like
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
this at seaworld town hall and women
 
02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
only voted for trump and she
 
02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
voted for trump but she also marked the
 
02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:57.270 align:start position:0%
voted for trump but she also marked the
write-in

02:25:57.270 --> 02:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
write-in
 
02:25:59.190 --> 02:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
and was trying to write his name in and
 
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
she had never done it before didn't
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
understand the process
 
02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
um so she was having a little bit
 
02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
difficult time and i thought
 
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
um you know what's going to happen if
 
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
you go to the rebound
 
02:26:14.070 --> 02:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
the presidential election wasn't imposed
 
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire but
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
what if you had a legislative race where
 
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
people did not quite understand the
 
02:26:22.389 --> 02:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
process we do have quite a few voters
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
over voters and younger voters who are
 
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
voting for the first time
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
and when you cast a ballot as a citizen
 
02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
the way i see it is you own your value
 
02:26:34.710 --> 02:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
your ballot belongs to you
 
02:26:37.030 --> 02:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
and you have an absolute legal moral and
 
02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to
 
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
mark your preferences the way you want
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
so many of the local races
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
that we have in seabrook are five
 
02:26:48.230 --> 02:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
candidates running for two planning
 
02:26:49.990 --> 02:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
boards for
 
02:26:53.510 --> 02:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
four uh candidates running for one
 
02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:54.790 align:start position:0%
four uh candidates running for one
selection

02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
selection
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
where we have we have multi-member
 
02:26:58.469 --> 02:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
districts one race
 
02:27:00.870 --> 02:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh i come from terms of material we
 
02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:03.349 align:start position:0%
uh i come from terms of material we
actually

02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:05.110 --> 02:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
so we've looked at instant run off
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
voting right choice voting and some of
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
the other options
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
and they do those who run into problems
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
when you have
 
02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts and especially if
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
you have uh you know going for two seats
 
02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
or three seats and you have
 
02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
quadrant control and if somebody does
 
02:27:24.389 --> 02:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
i've heard this before if somebody does
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
just want to vote against an incompetent
 
02:27:27.990 --> 02:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
selectmen and vote for the other three
 
02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:28.790 align:start position:0%
selectmen and vote for the other three
candidates

02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
they should have the right to do so but
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
most of what approval voting does
 
02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
is just say if somebody marked their
 
02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:36.389 align:start position:0%
is just say if somebody marked their
ballot

02:27:36.389 --> 02:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh twice for free candidates right now
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
we counted um under approval voting if
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
they mark three
 
02:27:47.510 --> 02:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
three candidates for two seats uh
 
02:27:49.349 --> 02:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
right now that could still amount your
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
whole ballot gets done
 
02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
on recounting throughout the entire
 
02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
ballot and that point has been
 
02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:55.750 align:start position:0%
ballot and that point has been
disenfranchised

02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised
 
02:27:57.830 --> 02:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
under approval voting we don't do that
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
we count every single vote
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that was brought up
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
in the majority report
 
02:28:05.429 --> 02:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
last time we brought this up the skills
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
we brought up twice to report
 
02:28:10.469 --> 02:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
the concern was might have people
 
02:28:12.309 --> 02:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
getting elected who didn't have
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
more than 51 of the votes but uh
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
but that's actually a bigger problem
 
02:28:19.750 --> 02:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
right now uh most members of the house
 
02:28:21.750 --> 02:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
of representatives right now didn't mend
 
02:28:22.870 --> 02:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
the doors especially
 
02:28:25.349 --> 02:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
not for multi-member districts uh some
 
02:28:25.359 --> 02:28:26.230 align:start position:0%
not for multi-member districts uh some
actually

02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:28:29.270 --> 02:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh less than 40 percent of the vote um
 
02:28:30.790 --> 02:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
but they were
 
02:28:33.670 --> 02:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
going for three seats and you know they
 
02:28:34.870 --> 02:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
got 39 percent
 
02:28:36.870 --> 02:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
and the next candidate down about 36
 
02:28:42.150 --> 02:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
the approval voting is much more useful
 
02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
for multi-member districts four-way
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
selection periods
 
02:28:49.590 --> 02:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh complicated bond issues uh something
 
02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
that needs to be
 
02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
resolved sometimes with serving on
 
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
municipal county and
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
in the town of captain falls the school
 
02:28:57.910 --> 02:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
board put on i believe it was a 5
 
02:28:59.349 --> 02:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
million dollar bond
 
02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
for the school district and by citizen's
 
02:29:03.429 --> 02:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
petition some people said that was
 
02:29:05.349 --> 02:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
enough so they wanted to do the full 7.5
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
because both of them were on the ballot
 
02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
at the same time they both failed
 
02:29:13.830 --> 02:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
neither got 60 percent if they needed
 
02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh pass and they had to come back and do
 
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
it again
 
02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
the subsequent year ended up costing
 
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
approval voting is the only it's the
 
02:29:29.190 --> 02:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
only alternative voting method that's
 
02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
actually simpler
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require any new software or
 
02:29:32.640 --> 02:29:33.429 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require any new software or
hardware

02:29:33.429 --> 02:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
hardware
 
02:29:36.790 --> 02:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
continues in the same standing devices
 
02:29:38.070 --> 02:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's easier to figure out what the
 
02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
intent of the voter was
 
02:29:43.990 --> 02:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
compared to all the other methods even
 
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
the current method
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
from st louis fargo have had
 
02:29:50.550 --> 02:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
very good success with approval voting
 
02:29:51.910 --> 02:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
some members of this committee who were
 
02:29:53.349 --> 02:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
here a couple of years ago said
 
02:29:55.030 --> 02:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
they wanted to see how other towns
 
02:29:56.790 --> 02:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
rolled out and make sure that the
 
02:29:58.710 --> 02:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
process was working
 
02:30:01.030 --> 02:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
i understand the logic behind that
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a potential lawsuit
 
02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
recount or somebody who speaks something
 
02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
you want somebody else to spend money
 
02:30:08.720 --> 02:30:13.750 align:start position:0%
you want somebody else to spend money
first

02:30:13.750 --> 02:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:16.790 --> 02:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
and finally approval voting is very
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
useful if you have independent
 
02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
candidates third party
 
02:30:21.910 --> 02:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh i think that it's a foregone
 
02:30:24.070 --> 02:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
conclusion that the libertarian party is
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to be on the ballot again
 
02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
they have been almost every year for 25
 
02:30:34.550 --> 02:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
that the constitution party the patriot
 
02:30:36.640 --> 02:30:37.670 align:start position:0%
that the constitution party the patriot
party

02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
party
 
02:30:42.469 --> 02:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
uh another party is cooking on those
 
02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
those voters who uh you could have a
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
constitution party candidate in your
 
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
race and you had a three-way race
 
02:30:52.150 --> 02:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
those voters who know you maybe want to
 
02:30:53.429 --> 02:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
make a statement
 
02:30:56.070 --> 02:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
but they'd like to vote for you also if
 
02:30:57.429 --> 02:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
they're voting for the third-party
 
02:30:57.439 --> 02:30:58.830 align:start position:0%
they're voting for the third-party
candidate

02:30:58.830 --> 02:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
02:30:58.840 --> 02:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
candidate
uh

02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:00.810 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:00.810 --> 02:31:13.590 align:start position:0%

02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
as um fundamental right to mark your
 
02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
ballot how you choose
 
02:31:34.150 --> 02:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
our job is just to tally the votes as
 
02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
accurately as
 
02:31:38.790 --> 02:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
we can and make sure as the constitution
 
02:31:38.800 --> 02:31:39.910 align:start position:0%
we can and make sure as the constitution
requires

02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
requires
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
and it's represented democracy requires
 
02:31:44.070 --> 02:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
it whoever the top vote getter is
 
02:31:45.590 --> 02:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
whoever actually accumulates the most
 
02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:47.190 align:start position:0%
whoever actually accumulates the most
folks

02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
folks
 
02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
um will this lead to tactical voting i
 
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
would say the opposite
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
i i see a lot more tactical voting i
 
02:31:56.469 --> 02:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
talk to a lot more voters who vote
 
02:31:58.550 --> 02:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
either against the republicans or
 
02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
democrats or against candidates we don't
 
02:32:00.800 --> 02:32:02.070 align:start position:0%
democrats or against candidates we don't
like

02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
quite a few uh republicans who voted
 
02:32:07.590 --> 02:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
they really didn't mind fighting repairs
 
02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
and they voted for them
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
so first pass the post that you have
 
02:32:16.710 --> 02:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
always states the tax for voting like 80
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
percent of what this announces
 
02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:36.840 --> 02:32:38.630 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing questions from committee
 
02:32:46.389 --> 02:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any hands thank you very
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
much mr
 
02:32:50.840 --> 02:32:55.750 align:start position:0%
much mr

also signed up to speak on this bill
 
02:32:58.399 --> 02:32:59.030 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill
today

02:32:59.030 --> 02:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:11.270 --> 02:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:13.349 --> 02:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm aaron hamlin i'm speaking on my
 
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
own behalf but i'm also the executive
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
director for the center for election
 
02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:18.469 align:start position:0%
director for the center for election
science

02:33:18.469 --> 02:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
science
 
02:33:20.230 --> 02:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
we've been around for 10 years we've
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
also been responsible with
 
02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
working with communities across the
 
02:33:27.030 --> 02:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
united states and implementing approval
 
02:33:27.040 --> 02:33:28.070 align:start position:0%
united states and implementing approval
voting

02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
we worked with if you can clarify for me
 
02:33:34.070 --> 02:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
are you speaking for yourself or for an
 
02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:35.030 align:start position:0%
are you speaking for yourself or for an
organization

02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
organization
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking on my own behalf okay so
 
02:33:39.190 --> 02:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
why don't you proceed with the testimony
 
02:33:41.910 --> 02:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so approval voting has
 
02:33:42.790 --> 02:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
been used
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
has been implemented in two cities um
 
02:33:46.630 --> 02:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
most recently st
 
02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
louis missouri and prior to that fargo
 
02:33:51.110 --> 02:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
north dakota
 
02:33:53.110 --> 02:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
and fargo north dakota was actually used
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
in a two-seat election
 
02:33:57.990 --> 02:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
in prior years fargo had seen elections
 
02:33:58.000 --> 02:33:58.710 align:start position:0%
in prior years fargo had seen elections
where

02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
the winner would be lucky to get 30 uh
 
02:34:02.950 --> 02:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
in this past election
 
02:34:05.349 --> 02:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh the two winners in that election uh
 
02:34:07.349 --> 02:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
got 55 percent approval for one
 
02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
and 51 percent approval for the other
 
02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
so one of the benefits of approval
 
02:34:14.630 --> 02:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
voting is it allows
 
02:34:16.950 --> 02:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh winners to lead with a mandate
 
02:34:19.590 --> 02:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
whereas previously they may have
 
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:25.830 --> 02:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
also approval voting really is what it's
 
02:34:27.429 --> 02:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
doing is it's removing an
 
02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
artificial limitation of requiring
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
voters to choose one candidate or to
 
02:34:33.830 --> 02:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
choose as many candidates
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
as there are seats to be filled and
 
02:34:37.830 --> 02:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
there's really no rational reason for
 
02:34:39.590 --> 02:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
doing that at limiting
 
02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
a voter's expression all it's really
 
02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:42.710 align:start position:0%
a voter's expression all it's really
doing

02:34:42.710 --> 02:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:34:45.270 --> 02:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
is encouraging polarization uh in the
 
02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
zero-sum game where it's saying choose
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
this party or choose the other party
 
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
rather than allowing voters to
 
02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
compromise which would
 
02:34:55.590 --> 02:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
encourage more consensus winners which
 
02:34:56.070 --> 02:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
is what
 
02:34:58.230 --> 02:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
approval voting does leading towards
 
02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
those more consensus winners
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
also across the across new hampshire um
 
02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a number of third parties
 
02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
run this is not new
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
seen it for a long time also seen it in
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
the presidential race
 
02:35:13.590 --> 02:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
approval voting addresses and solves the
 
02:35:14.550 --> 02:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
spoiler problem
 
02:35:16.309 --> 02:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
by allowing voters to choose as many
 
02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
candidates as they want
 
02:35:19.270 --> 02:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
so if they want to choose you too in
 
02:35:21.429 --> 02:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
addition to say a third party or a
 
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
libertarian candidate
 
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
they can do that there's there's no
 
02:35:25.990 --> 02:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
issue with that it's a
 
02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
it's a very fair way of doing that by
 
02:35:31.349 --> 02:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
not taking away their expression while
 
02:35:33.429 --> 02:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
at the same time making sure that
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're not forced to split the vote
 
02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
between you and a third-party candidate
 
02:35:41.990 --> 02:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
also it's important for primaries so
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
when you have a crowded field in
 
02:35:45.110 --> 02:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
primaries in particular
 
02:35:47.270 --> 02:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
what can happen is you can have a number
 
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
of candidates in the middle who split
 
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
their vote
 
02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
and as a consequence you can have more
 
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
extreme candidates win
 
02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
as a result approval voting allows
 
02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
voters to choose
 
02:35:58.710 --> 02:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
multiple of those candidates so those
 
02:36:00.469 --> 02:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
candidates in the center don't split
 
02:36:01.910 --> 02:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
their vote and we have
 
02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
a much more representative nominee
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
for that and overall we're talking about
 
02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
a voting method that is
 
02:36:13.830 --> 02:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh virtually free i just have some
 
02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:14.630 align:start position:0%
uh virtually free i just have some
education

02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh component which uh the organization i
 
02:36:21.990 --> 02:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
i've been with they've been great about
 
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
working with cities throughout the us
 
02:36:25.510 --> 02:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
after they've
 
02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
implemented approval voting and doing
 
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
the education campaign
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
and it's something that is incredibly
 
02:36:33.590 --> 02:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
simple we're really just talking about
 
02:36:34.469 --> 02:36:34.479 align:start position:0%
the language
 
02:36:37.590 --> 02:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
difference within the ballot itself but
 
02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:38.070 align:start position:0%
difference within the ballot itself but
i've

02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
i've
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
looked at this issue for this is
 
02:36:45.270 --> 02:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
my profession so i'm also happy to take
 
02:36:46.230 --> 02:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:36:47.830 --> 02:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
and address any concerns that you have
 
02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you does anybody in the room
 
02:36:56.710 --> 02:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
have any questions for mr hamlin
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien thank you
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr hamlin are you aware of any
 
02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
increase in voter turnout since this
 
02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
method has been
 
02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
employed in fargo and in saint louis
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
the the issue of voter turnout is
 
02:37:16.389 --> 02:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
something that is challenging to be able
 
02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
to determine so like if we're trying to
 
02:37:20.950 --> 02:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
look at like the difference between uh
 
02:37:21.990 --> 02:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
two groups like
 
02:37:24.389 --> 02:37:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh one uh pre-approval voting and then
 
02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
post-approval voting
 
02:37:28.630 --> 02:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
we've seen one election so far so it's
 
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
difficult to extrapolate from that
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
individual election particularly
 
02:37:33.270 --> 02:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
given that that election took place
 
02:37:34.870 --> 02:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
during the middle of a pandemic
 
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
so there's not really a good comparison
 
02:37:39.270 --> 02:37:39.280 align:start position:0%

hampshire

02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:38:40.830 --> 02:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
and i am in support of house bill
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
505 this is a concept
 
02:38:46.150 --> 02:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
as was explained before that's also
 
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
known as approval voting
 
02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
and i like the idea that it
 
02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
allows the voter to better express their
 
02:38:58.230 --> 02:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
opinion of all the candidates for any
 
02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:05.429 --> 02:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
the plurality voting that we currently
 
02:39:05.439 --> 02:39:06.630 align:start position:0%
the plurality voting that we currently
have

02:39:06.630 --> 02:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:39:09.670 --> 02:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
is essentially only works right when
 
02:39:12.070 --> 02:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's only two candidates
 
02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh then you're just choosing one or the
 
02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
other as soon as there's more than two
 
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
candidates then then the approval
 
02:39:20.230 --> 02:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
and the plurality voting starts to break
 
02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:22.710 align:start position:0%
and the plurality voting starts to break
down

02:39:22.710 --> 02:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
so with the being able to to do this
 
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
concept as presented in this bill
 
02:39:32.150 --> 02:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
um essentially all we're doing is
 
02:39:35.429 --> 02:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
ignoring overvotes or the
 
02:39:37.990 --> 02:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
term and it makes it easier to program
 
02:39:39.270 --> 02:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
accuvope machines because they don't
 
02:39:43.830 --> 02:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
have to program in the number for
 
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
that constitutes uh overvote
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
um i think the approval voting will show
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
its best in the presidential primary
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
where we usually have a field of about
 
02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
30 candidates
 
02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
in either party even this past
 
02:40:04.550 --> 02:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
presidential primary on the republican
 
02:40:07.429 --> 02:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
side there were 17 candidates
 
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
in spite of the strength of
 
02:40:13.990 --> 02:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:17.269 --> 02:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
this still works
 
02:40:20.469 --> 02:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
and if you think of a presidential
 
02:40:20.479 --> 02:40:22.070 align:start position:0%
and if you think of a presidential
primary

02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
primary
 
02:40:24.710 --> 02:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
there's often several candidates that
 
02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
you can
 
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
say hey these are these are guys that i
 
02:40:29.510 --> 02:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
think might be
 
02:40:33.349 --> 02:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
who i want for president um
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
and it's not unusual to find that right
 
02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
after our primary or sometimes even
 
02:40:40.469 --> 02:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
before our primary
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
that your favorite candidate has
 
02:40:44.710 --> 02:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
suddenly suspended his campaign
 
02:40:46.550 --> 02:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
so at least in this case you would have
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
been able to
 
02:40:51.349 --> 02:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
vote for several of them if there were
 
02:40:52.790 --> 02:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
several that you
 
02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
thought were okay you would have
 
02:40:58.469 --> 02:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
supported one of those candidates
 
02:41:01.429 --> 02:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
and also in the presidential primary
 
02:41:02.790 --> 02:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
unique in one way in that we're not
 
02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:06.469 align:start position:0%
unique in one way in that we're not
directly

02:41:06.469 --> 02:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
directly
 
02:41:08.630 --> 02:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
deciding who's going to be on the
 
02:41:10.309 --> 02:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
november ballot
 
02:41:14.230 --> 02:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is uh determining the
 
02:41:17.349 --> 02:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
allocation of delegates to the party's
 
02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
national conventions
 
02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
and also
 
02:41:26.710 --> 02:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
we're providing useful information to
 
02:41:29.429 --> 02:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
all the other states that have yet to do
 
02:41:33.990 --> 02:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:36.150 --> 02:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
one thing about the presidential primary
 
02:41:39.269 --> 02:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
the text for this bill should be amended
 
02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
to include the same
 
02:41:47.790 --> 02:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
provisions to be applied to rsa
 
02:41:51.269 --> 02:41:51.279 align:start position:0%
656 colon 31 which deals with
 
02:41:53.269 --> 02:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
presidential primaries
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
separate from all the statewide races
 
02:42:02.710 --> 02:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:05.429 --> 02:42:05.439 align:start position:0%
approval voting also can work in the
 
02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan municipal elections
 
02:42:12.150 --> 02:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
in that the approval voting can handle
 
02:42:15.429 --> 02:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
full ballots so it actually eliminates
 
02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
the need to have a primary election
 
02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
to reduce the number of votes down to
 
02:42:22.710 --> 02:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
two candidates for a one-person office
 
02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:23.590 align:start position:0%
two candidates for a one-person office
or

02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:42:26.790 --> 02:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
to twice the number of of candidates as
 
02:42:29.510 --> 02:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
there are seats to be filled
 
02:42:34.269 --> 02:42:34.279 align:start position:0%
um just by that by virtue of that the
 
02:42:37.349 --> 02:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities can save some uh
 
02:42:39.510 --> 02:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
much needed money just by not having to
 
02:42:46.389 --> 02:42:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:49.510 --> 02:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
i did send an email to the many members
 
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
and i
 
02:42:53.590 --> 02:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
on line five and six where the new i
 
02:42:57.190 --> 02:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
02:42:59.990 --> 02:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
where the new text says vote for one or
 
02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:01.429 align:start position:0%
where the new text says vote for one or
more

02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
add an additional sentence blank will be
 
02:43:05.429 --> 02:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
elected so that
 
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
the voters know how many people are
 
02:43:08.469 --> 02:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
going to be elected for that
 
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
even though they you know they may be
 
02:43:11.670 --> 02:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
voting for three and there's only two
 
02:43:13.670 --> 02:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
going to be elected
 
02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
um that also
 
02:43:20.230 --> 02:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
um oh on line 21
 
02:43:23.349 --> 02:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
after the phrase uh of
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
your choice or choices add the sentence
 
02:43:27.670 --> 02:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
you may vote for
 
02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
more than the number of candidates to be
 
02:43:31.590 --> 02:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
elected that's under the instructions on
 
02:43:33.110 --> 02:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
the ballot
 
02:43:38.710 --> 02:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
those two changes need to also be
 
02:43:46.230 --> 02:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
applied to
 
02:43:49.349 --> 02:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
rsa 656 colon 31 for the presidential
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
primary which was missed in the original
 
02:43:53.910 --> 02:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
build text
 
02:43:57.030 --> 02:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
a small actually non-germane but helpful
 
02:43:57.040 --> 02:43:57.830 align:start position:0%
a small actually non-germane but helpful
amendment

02:43:57.830 --> 02:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:44:00.870 --> 02:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
would be in the middle of line five to
 
02:44:01.830 --> 02:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
leak the words
 
02:44:04.389 --> 02:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
small but for the text size when it's
 
02:44:04.399 --> 02:44:05.830 align:start position:0%
small but for the text size when it's
describing

02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
describing
 
02:44:07.750 --> 02:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
the sentence on the ballot that tells
 
02:44:12.870 --> 02:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:16.389 --> 02:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
i've noticed that i often hear
 
02:44:19.269 --> 02:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
people mention that the we have an aging
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:27.269 --> 02:44:27.279 align:start position:0%
having small type is not a good thing to
 
02:44:29.670 --> 02:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
have there that also applies to the in
 
02:44:32.230 --> 02:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
the line 31.
 
02:44:35.910 --> 02:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
and i would like to
 
02:44:39.030 --> 02:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
comment to a question that uh
 
02:44:43.269 --> 02:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
representing hamlet had asked about the
 
02:44:46.469 --> 02:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing that there would be a
 
02:44:48.870 --> 02:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
candidate would receive 50
 
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
this does not guarantee that candidate
 
02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
will receive 50 percent
 
02:44:57.349 --> 02:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
you could have two people receive 49
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
but uh it also can happen
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
that you can have more than one
 
02:45:04.950 --> 02:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
candidate have
 
02:45:09.030 --> 02:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
greater than 50 um
 
02:45:12.309 --> 02:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
and that was mentioned in that
 
02:45:15.910 --> 02:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
question was uh rank choice voting
 
02:45:18.790 --> 02:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily guarantee greater
 
02:45:20.150 --> 02:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
than 50 percent
 
02:45:22.230 --> 02:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
it's looking for that but once you get
 
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
through all the
 
02:45:27.030 --> 02:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
rankings if somebody still doesn't have
 
02:45:28.230 --> 02:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
greater than 50
 
02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
and also
 
02:45:43.110 --> 02:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
on the uh just to remember
 
02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:53.030 --> 02:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
the constitution our state constitution
 
02:45:55.269 --> 02:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
for the offices of senate
 
02:45:58.230 --> 02:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
governor and executive council
 
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
specifically now use the word plurality
 
02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
for the election that was approved in
 
02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:05.830 align:start position:0%
for the election that was approved in
1912

02:46:05.830 --> 02:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
1912
 
02:46:08.230 --> 02:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention although they
 
02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
left the wording
 
02:46:13.590 --> 02:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
in the sentences now rather poorly
 
02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:17.269 align:start position:0%
in the sentences now rather poorly
structured

02:46:17.269 --> 02:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:19.510 --> 02:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
i would think that it might be worth
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
having a
 
02:46:23.590 --> 02:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
legal opinion that
 
02:46:27.349 --> 02:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
this change in the voting would not
 
02:46:31.030 --> 02:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh affect that uh
 
02:46:35.190 --> 02:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional provisions and that's uh
 
02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:45.680 align:start position:0%

505
 
02:48:35.269 --> 02:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
and i only want to point out two points
 
02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
that might not be intuitively obvious to
 
02:48:39.670 --> 02:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
the committee members
 
02:48:42.630 --> 02:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
the first is that it is only when you
 
02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:43.590 align:start position:0%
the first is that it is only when you
allow

02:48:43.590 --> 02:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
allow
 
02:48:46.389 --> 02:48:46.399 align:start position:0%
voters to freely support all the
 
02:48:47.910 --> 02:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
candidates they want
 
02:48:50.070 --> 02:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
that you can actually tell the level of
 
02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:51.110 align:start position:0%
that you can actually tell the level of
support

02:48:51.110 --> 02:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
all the candidates have and you don't
 
02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:54.389 align:start position:0%
all the candidates have and you don't
currently

02:48:54.389 --> 02:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:48:59.190 --> 02:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
have that today the election
 
02:49:01.750 --> 02:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee members the representatives
 
02:49:03.429 --> 02:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
what the voters really want
 
02:49:05.750 --> 02:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
they are fully capable of designing a
 
02:49:07.190 --> 02:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
political platform
 
02:49:09.269 --> 02:49:09.279 align:start position:0%
that aligns completely with what the
 
02:49:10.630 --> 02:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
voters desire
 
02:49:13.830 --> 02:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
but because of the election system
 
02:49:16.950 --> 02:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
that you currently have voters
 
02:49:19.990 --> 02:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
will split votes between like-minded
 
02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:21.349 align:start position:0%
will split votes between like-minded
candidates

02:49:21.349 --> 02:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
02:49:24.469 --> 02:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
leaving the possibility that a less
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
desired candidate or a less desired
 
02:49:26.399 --> 02:49:27.269 align:start position:0%
desired candidate or a less desired
platform

02:49:27.269 --> 02:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
platform
 
02:49:30.469 --> 02:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
could win the election the second point
 
02:49:33.269 --> 02:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
i wanted to bring up is the idea i'd
 
02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
like you to consider
 
02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
a single seat election but with multiple
 
02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:38.230 align:start position:0%
a single seat election but with multiple
candidates

02:49:38.230 --> 02:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
02:49:41.830 --> 02:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
more than two at least currently today
 
02:49:44.710 --> 02:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
a voter only is allowed to provide one
 
02:49:45.429 --> 02:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
point of
 
02:49:48.790 --> 02:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
input which candidate do they want
 
02:49:51.429 --> 02:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
the system does not know what they think
 
02:49:53.349 --> 02:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
of any of those other candidates it
 
02:49:55.030 --> 02:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
could be three it could be four
 
02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
it has no idea that lack of knowledge
 
02:50:01.269 --> 02:50:01.279 align:start position:0%
goes into determining who wins the
 
02:50:01.279 --> 02:50:02.790 align:start position:0%
goes into determining who wins the
election

02:50:02.790 --> 02:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:50:06.230 --> 02:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
in contrast in an hb
 
02:50:10.230 --> 02:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
505 type election what would happen
 
02:50:13.510 --> 02:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
is that the even if a
 
02:50:16.710 --> 02:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
voter only selected one candidate
 
02:50:18.870 --> 02:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
because they could choose the other ones
 
02:50:20.550 --> 02:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
they are sending a deliberate message
 
02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
that they
 
02:50:23.110 --> 02:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
do not want to support those other
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
candidates so in other words
 
02:50:29.349 --> 02:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
every voter has an input on every single
 
02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
candidate and because all of that
 
02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
information is used
 
02:50:36.870 --> 02:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
to determine the winner the result of
 
02:50:40.150 --> 02:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
every 505 election will give you
 
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
the most approved of candidate every
 
02:50:43.990 --> 02:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
single time
 
02:50:46.150 --> 02:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
it'll give you the most approved of
 
02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
lists of candidates
 
02:50:50.389 --> 02:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
every single time more information into
 
02:50:51.269 --> 02:50:51.279 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:50:53.190 --> 02:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
more power for the voter you get a
 
02:50:54.870 --> 02:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
better result
 
02:50:58.070 --> 02:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
hb 505 is a simple
 
02:51:00.469 --> 02:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
and easy to understand modification to
 
02:51:02.389 --> 02:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
the election rules
 
02:51:04.550 --> 02:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
however provides a lot more power to the
 
02:51:04.560 --> 02:51:05.670 align:start position:0%
however provides a lot more power to the
voters

02:51:05.670 --> 02:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
voters
 
02:51:07.910 --> 02:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
it ensures the most approved of
 
02:51:10.150 --> 02:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
candidates win
 
02:51:12.469 --> 02:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
and it provides to you the current
 
02:51:14.070 --> 02:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
elected officials
 
02:51:16.309 --> 02:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
greater and more robust political
 
02:51:16.319 --> 02:51:17.429 align:start position:0%
greater and more robust political
support

02:51:17.429 --> 02:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
505 is a powerful and smart initiative

02:51:58.160 --> 02:51:59.269 align:start position:0%
working directly with our allies and our
partners

02:51:59.269 --> 02:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
partners
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
overseas and i can tell you from
 
02:52:03.670 --> 02:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
personal experience how easy it is
 
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
for our adversaries to exploit the
 
02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:06.710 align:start position:0%
for our adversaries to exploit the
cracks

02:52:06.710 --> 02:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
cracks
 
02:52:08.950 --> 02:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
within our political parties and between
 
02:52:10.710 --> 02:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
our political parties
 
02:52:13.910 --> 02:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
if all of the states were to enact the
 
02:52:15.910 --> 02:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that you are currently
 
02:52:15.920 --> 02:52:17.190 align:start position:0%
legislation that you are currently
considering

02:52:17.190 --> 02:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
considering
 
02:52:20.550 --> 02:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
we would have a far much a far much more
 
02:52:23.670 --> 02:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
safer country and more robust against
 
02:52:24.950 --> 02:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
these malign
 
02:52:27.510 --> 02:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
influences of these adversary countries
 
02:52:28.070 --> 02:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
who would like
 
02:52:29.830 --> 02:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
nothing more than to see us dissolve
 
02:52:31.349 --> 02:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
from an uncivil war
 
02:52:35.590 --> 02:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:38.790 --> 02:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
further questions did i
 
02:52:41.349 --> 02:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
mr geshman perhaps i'm confused the
 
02:52:41.359 --> 02:52:42.070 align:start position:0%
mr geshman perhaps i'm confused the
representative

02:52:42.070 --> 02:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:52:43.269 --> 02:52:43.279 align:start position:0%
asked if you were a resident of new
 
02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire you said you were not what
 
02:52:47.269 --> 02:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
state are you a resident of
 
02:52:49.110 --> 02:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
i am a resident of the state of nevada
 
02:52:50.630 --> 02:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
madam chairman
 
02:52:54.830 --> 02:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:54.840 --> 02:52:57.110 align:start position:0%
 
witness

02:52:57.110 --> 02:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
witness
 
02:52:58.870 --> 02:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you very much
 
02:53:00.790 --> 02:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
for joining us this morning
 
02:53:03.510 --> 02:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
mr cape
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
um mr k
 
02:53:11.269 --> 02:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
welcome to the election law committee
 
02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
this morning um
 
02:53:17.429 --> 02:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
welcome for your testimony on hb 505.
 
02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for having me and
 
02:53:20.630 --> 02:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak
 
02:53:23.990 --> 02:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
i am a new hampshire resident i
 
02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
went to school in whitefield new
 
02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i attend
 
02:53:30.790 --> 02:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
dartmouth college so i would like to say
 
02:53:32.389 --> 02:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
that approval voting
 
02:53:34.469 --> 02:53:34.479 align:start position:0%
is a marginal improvement within our
 
02:53:36.150 --> 02:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
system with marginal cost
 
02:53:39.110 --> 02:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
but i think what's not been quite so
 
02:53:40.309 --> 02:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
discussed here
 
02:53:41.990 --> 02:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
is the fact that it doesn't have an
 
02:53:44.309 --> 02:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
ordinal component that you are not able
 
02:53:44.870 --> 02:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
to see
 
02:53:47.670 --> 02:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
the difference uh between candidates as
 
02:53:49.510 --> 02:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
far as rankings go
 
02:53:53.110 --> 02:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
so while they've said that if you do not
 
02:53:53.120 --> 02:53:53.670 align:start position:0%
so while they've said that if you do not
approve

02:53:53.670 --> 02:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
approve
 
02:53:55.590 --> 02:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
of a specific candidate you might
 
02:53:57.830 --> 02:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
approve of all the others
 
02:54:00.630 --> 02:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
and vote such a way and that can be
 
02:54:00.640 --> 02:54:01.510 align:start position:0%
and vote such a way and that can be
useful

02:54:01.510 --> 02:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
useful
 
02:54:04.469 --> 02:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
but in other voting systems uh including
 
02:54:05.590 --> 02:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
ranked choice voting
 
02:54:08.710 --> 02:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
that by giving an ordinal uh account
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh ranking of some sort you can more
 
02:54:12.160 --> 02:54:12.630 align:start position:0%
uh ranking of some sort you can more
fully

02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
fully
 
02:54:14.469 --> 02:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
see the spectrum of support that
 
02:54:16.790 --> 02:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
candidates have in comparison
 
02:54:19.510 --> 02:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
to approval voting it's also worth
 
02:54:19.520 --> 02:54:19.990 align:start position:0%
to approval voting it's also worth
noting

02:54:19.990 --> 02:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
noting
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
that when discussing approval voting
 
02:54:26.230 --> 02:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
there is a high level albeit not as high
 
02:54:27.429 --> 02:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
as a plurality vote
 
02:54:29.110 --> 02:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
that we currently have both within the
 
02:54:31.110 --> 02:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
bloc system and not within the bloc
 
02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
system of strategic voting
 
02:54:37.269 --> 02:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
where if two candidates who i might
 
02:54:38.550 --> 02:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
approve of
 
02:54:41.030 --> 02:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
are net connect with each other if i'm
 
02:54:41.990 --> 02:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
being strategic
 
02:54:45.110 --> 02:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
i will not vote for the second place
 
02:54:46.630 --> 02:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
like the neck and neck person
 
02:54:49.269 --> 02:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
i'll go with my favorite choice not
 
02:54:51.349 --> 02:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
showing my approval for the other person
 
02:54:54.230 --> 02:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
so that i can strategically vote to get
 
02:54:56.309 --> 02:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
my preferred candidate ahead
 
02:54:59.349 --> 02:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
while i might have approved of both
 
02:55:01.990 --> 02:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
and different systems can account for
 
02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:02.550 align:start position:0%
and different systems can account for
that

02:55:02.550 --> 02:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:55:05.190 --> 02:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
that is not accounted for within an
 
02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:05.910 align:start position:0%
that is not accounted for within an
approval

02:55:05.910 --> 02:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
approval
 
02:55:10.150 --> 02:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
voting system um approval voting
 
02:55:12.710 --> 02:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
as was said earlier does not ensure a
 
02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:13.429 align:start position:0%
as was said earlier does not ensure a
majority

02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
majority
 
02:55:15.590 --> 02:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
it does not really give an extra claim
 
02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:17.190 align:start position:0%
it does not really give an extra claim
to

02:55:17.190 --> 02:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:55:19.269 --> 02:55:19.279 align:start position:0%
doing too much to get a majority it's
 
02:55:20.469 --> 02:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
showing the percent of voters who
 
02:55:21.750 --> 02:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
approve of a candidate
 
02:55:24.150 --> 02:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
which can be useful information but it's
 
02:55:24.870 --> 02:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
not a
 
02:55:26.870 --> 02:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of the vote and it does not
 
02:55:26.880 --> 02:55:28.630 align:start position:0%
percentage of the vote and it does not
give

02:55:28.630 --> 02:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
give
 
02:55:31.750 --> 02:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
good information on preference
 
02:55:35.429 --> 02:55:35.439 align:start position:0%
on ranking as opposed to a binary
 
02:55:38.710 --> 02:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
of i can live with them or i can't live
 
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
with them
 
02:55:42.630 --> 02:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's distinct from ranked choice voting
 
02:55:44.230 --> 02:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
and i can talk more about ranked choice
 
02:55:44.240 --> 02:55:45.110 align:start position:0%
and i can talk more about ranked choice
voting

02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:55:47.429 --> 02:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
um if people are interested in the
 
02:55:47.439 --> 02:55:49.429 align:start position:0%
um if people are interested in the
differences

02:55:49.429 --> 02:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
differences
 
02:55:51.670 --> 02:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
and i'll be happy to take questions if
 
02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
anyone has any

okay yeah good afternoon madam chair and
 
02:57:48.950 --> 02:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:57:50.230 --> 02:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
stephen cobb
 
02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
and i've already submitted written
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
testimony into the record but i thought
 
02:57:55.830 --> 02:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
i should summarize a couple key points
 
02:57:57.750 --> 02:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
also i could address the points about
 
02:57:59.910 --> 02:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
irv the the ranked choice voting that
 
02:58:01.190 --> 02:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
were raised recently if you have
 
02:58:02.550 --> 02:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
questions about that
 
02:58:04.710 --> 02:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
so my my testimony took the form of an
 
02:58:06.630 --> 02:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
op-ed that was published yesterday
 
02:58:09.510 --> 02:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
in the union leader and my op-ed was in
 
02:58:11.030 --> 02:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
response to one by
 
02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
kelly ayotte and lamontagne
 
02:58:16.790 --> 02:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
back in september now the two of them
 
02:58:17.750 --> 02:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
were calling for
 
02:58:20.469 --> 02:58:20.479 align:start position:0%
post-primary party unity which is a very
 
02:58:21.429 --> 02:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
nice thing
 
02:58:22.950 --> 02:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
and it's nice to hear coming from them
 
02:58:24.790 --> 02:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
together but
 
02:58:27.110 --> 02:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
party unity is not a magical thing that
 
02:58:29.190 --> 02:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
happens automatically
 
02:58:31.910 --> 02:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
it has prerequisites and one of those
 
02:58:31.920 --> 02:58:33.030 align:start position:0%
it has prerequisites and one of those
prerequisites

02:58:33.030 --> 02:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
prerequisites
 
02:58:36.550 --> 02:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
is that the primary be a
 
02:58:39.429 --> 02:58:39.439 align:start position:0%
valid and fair one that people the
 
02:58:39.439 --> 02:58:40.150 align:start position:0%
valid and fair one that people the
voters

02:58:40.150 --> 02:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
voters
 
02:58:42.870 --> 02:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
have confidence in and if you'll recall
 
02:58:45.110 --> 02:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
in 2010
 
02:58:48.469 --> 02:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh kelly ayotte beat lamontagne by a
 
02:58:48.479 --> 02:58:48.870 align:start position:0%
uh kelly ayotte beat lamontagne by a
mere

02:58:48.870 --> 02:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
mere
 
02:58:52.150 --> 02:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
1 percentage point 38 to 37
 
02:58:54.150 --> 02:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
there were two other candidates in the
 
02:58:56.070 --> 02:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
in the primary bill benny
 
02:58:59.349 --> 02:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
and jim bender who got far more
 
02:59:01.670 --> 02:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
than the margin between ayotte and
 
02:59:01.680 --> 02:59:02.790 align:start position:0%
than the margin between ayotte and
lamontagne

02:59:02.790 --> 02:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
lamontagne
 
02:59:04.389 --> 02:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
so that was a classic case of vote
 
02:59:06.790 --> 02:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
splitting and i know very well because i
 
02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
was on the jim bender campaign
 
02:59:12.309 --> 02:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
and all of our efforts did nothing
 
02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
but shift the outcome from
 
02:59:17.910 --> 02:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
llaman probably from la maintained ayat
 
02:59:17.920 --> 02:59:18.469 align:start position:0%
llaman probably from la maintained ayat
as

02:59:18.469 --> 02:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:59:21.510 --> 02:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
how we expect um
 
02:59:24.150 --> 02:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
so you could think this is a rare rare
 
02:59:24.160 --> 02:59:25.670 align:start position:0%
so you could think this is a rare rare
occurrence

02:59:25.670 --> 02:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
occurrence
 
02:59:27.030 --> 02:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how often boat
 
02:59:28.950 --> 02:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
splitting happens to change elections
 
02:59:30.630 --> 02:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
but uh you know it happened again to
 
02:59:33.110 --> 02:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
kelly ayotte in 2016
 
02:59:36.790 --> 02:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
with the spoiler uh aaron day but
 
02:59:39.349 --> 02:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
quite often boat splitting is lurking in
 
02:59:40.150 --> 02:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
the background
 
02:59:41.910 --> 02:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's the threat of it so it's
 
02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
discouraging candidates
 
02:59:46.870 --> 02:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
from entering the race uh from tossing
 
02:59:48.389 --> 02:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
their hat in the ring and now that's a
 
02:59:50.150 --> 02:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
sad thing
 
02:59:52.230 --> 02:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh but fortunately there is a simple
 
02:59:53.510 --> 02:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
solution this
 
02:59:55.110 --> 02:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
voting method that we're discussing
 
02:59:56.870 --> 02:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
today approval voting
 
03:00:01.110 --> 03:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
it has minimal cost and huge impact
 
03:00:03.910 --> 03:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
i it was dismissed recently by speaker
 
03:00:05.429 --> 03:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
as being a
 
03:00:07.030 --> 03:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
only marginal improvement actually would
 
03:00:09.349 --> 03:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
be a dramatic improvement
 
03:00:12.389 --> 03:00:12.399 align:start position:0%
if you look at simulation performance
 
03:00:14.150 --> 03:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
of the various alternative voting
 
03:00:16.389 --> 03:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
methods approval voting has by far
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
the biggest impact for the cost all
 
03:00:22.150 --> 03:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
other alternative methods exist that are
 
03:00:23.510 --> 03:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
actually better
 
03:00:26.710 --> 03:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
in the sense they produce better results
 
03:00:28.790 --> 03:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
but they have a far greater cost in
 
03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:30.230 align:start position:0%
but they have a far greater cost in
complexity

03:00:30.230 --> 03:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
complexity
 
03:00:33.349 --> 03:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
that's voter instructions
 
03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
error rates tabulation
 
03:00:39.349 --> 03:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
recounting the ability to count the
 
03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
votes centrally
 
03:00:46.070 --> 03:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
or locally rather than centrally
 
03:00:49.590 --> 03:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
so i'll just add this if
 
03:00:53.110 --> 03:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
approval voting is not
 
03:00:55.110 --> 03:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
it does not distinguish preferences
 
03:00:56.550 --> 03:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
enough for you
 
03:00:58.230 --> 03:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
you can upgrade it to what's called
 
03:00:59.670 --> 03:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
score voting
 
03:01:01.349 --> 03:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
where you rate the candidates not just
 
03:01:03.429 --> 03:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
zero or one but
 
03:01:06.070 --> 03:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
zero through five if necessary but
 
03:01:07.349 --> 03:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're discussing today
 
03:01:07.359 --> 03:01:07.750 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're discussing today
today

03:01:07.750 --> 03:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:01:11.429 --> 03:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
we're discussing approval voting so
 
03:01:13.990 --> 03:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of bang for the buck approval
 
03:01:14.870 --> 03:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
voting is
 
03:01:18.070 --> 03:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
a no-brainer and i highly encourage you
 
03:01:19.990 --> 03:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
to support it
 
03:01:21.750 --> 03:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
and uh i'll take any questions you might
 
03:01:23.590 --> 03:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
have even though we're
 
03:01:27.110 --> 03:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
close to lunchtime any questions from
 
03:01:30.790 --> 03:01:30.800 align:start position:0%

okay so this bill is a request of the
 
03:03:34.389 --> 03:03:34.399 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office again
 
03:03:37.830 --> 03:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
um this office the office feels that the
 
03:03:40.190 --> 03:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
formula in rsa
 
03:03:43.750 --> 03:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
656.5 it's just too complex
 
03:03:45.750 --> 03:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
and they're going to propose an
 
03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:47.349 align:start position:0%
and they're going to propose an
amendment

03:03:47.349 --> 03:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:03:50.150 --> 03:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
the idea is to put each party columns
 
03:03:50.160 --> 03:03:50.950 align:start position:0%
the idea is to put each party columns
posted

03:03:50.950 --> 03:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
posted
 
03:03:53.510 --> 03:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
an equal number of times as a fairness
 
03:03:53.520 --> 03:03:55.190 align:start position:0%
an equal number of times as a fairness
issue

03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:03:57.830 --> 03:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
every 10 years after redistricting takes
 
03:03:57.840 --> 03:03:58.469 align:start position:0%
every 10 years after redistricting takes
place

03:03:58.469 --> 03:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:04:01.030 --> 03:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's formula for
 
03:04:02.790 --> 03:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
each column rotation
 
03:04:04.790 --> 03:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
tries to have each column and elected
 
03:04:07.349 --> 03:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
office in different positions
 
03:04:09.349 --> 03:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office fields
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
by removing the complex sentence
 
03:04:15.349 --> 03:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
in rsa 656 column 5
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
and adding in an amendment this will
 
03:04:21.030 --> 03:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:23.269 --> 03:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wells will you

i think i'm going to defer to deputy
scamland

03:04:58.070 --> 03:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
after the decennial census we are

recalculating the party column rotation
 
03:05:04.319 --> 03:05:04.630 align:start position:0%
recalculating the party column rotation
that

03:05:04.630 --> 03:05:04.640 align:start position:0%

03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:07.840 align:start position:0%

ballots
 
03:05:13.269 --> 03:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
there was a a court ruling
 
03:05:16.230 --> 03:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
well over a decade ago after some
 
03:05:16.240 --> 03:05:17.110 align:start position:0%
well over a decade ago after some
litigation

03:05:17.110 --> 03:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
03:05:20.469 --> 03:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
about candidate rotations on the ballot
 
03:05:20.479 --> 03:05:21.030 align:start position:0%
about candidate rotations on the ballot
and

03:05:21.030 --> 03:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:05:24.070 --> 03:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
party column rotations where the judge
 
03:05:26.950 --> 03:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
ruled that as a matter of fairness
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
our ballot had to contain rotation
 
03:05:29.040 --> 03:05:30.150 align:start position:0%
our ballot had to contain rotation
schemes

03:05:30.150 --> 03:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
schemes
 
03:05:33.110 --> 03:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that each candidate in the
 
03:05:33.830 --> 03:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
case of
 
03:05:37.190 --> 03:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh the candidate listings or
 
03:05:40.710 --> 03:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
party columns on the ballot had to be
 
03:05:43.110 --> 03:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
rotated so that they would appear in the
 
03:05:43.120 --> 03:05:43.990 align:start position:0%
rotated so that they would appear in the
first

03:05:43.990 --> 03:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:05:48.230 --> 03:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
second third and fourth if necessary
 
03:05:51.510 --> 03:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
positions as equal a number of times as
 
03:05:54.950 --> 03:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
is reasonably possible so there was a
 
03:05:57.269 --> 03:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that was filed that
 
03:05:59.030 --> 03:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
kind of directed the secretary of
 
03:06:03.670 --> 03:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:06.550 --> 03:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
and before i get there i just want to
 
03:06:06.560 --> 03:06:07.349 align:start position:0%
and before i get there i just want to
read

03:06:07.349 --> 03:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
read
 
03:06:11.110 --> 03:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 2 from rsa 5
 
03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
656 colon 5 which says the
 
03:06:16.870 --> 03:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
position of party columns shall be
 
03:06:19.349 --> 03:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
rotated on the ballots used
 
03:06:21.590 --> 03:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
so that each party column shall appear
 
03:06:21.600 --> 03:06:22.630 align:start position:0%
so that each party column shall appear
thereon

03:06:22.630 --> 03:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
thereon
 
03:06:25.670 --> 03:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
to the extent practicable and
 
03:06:27.750 --> 03:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
approximately equal number of times in
 
03:06:28.309 --> 03:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
the first
 
03:06:30.550 --> 03:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
last and each intermediate column
 
03:06:32.790 --> 03:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
position across the state
 
03:06:34.870 --> 03:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh without requiring more than one
 
03:06:37.269 --> 03:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
unique column order or ballot format
 
03:06:39.190 --> 03:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
for each town ward or unincorporated
 
03:06:40.469 --> 03:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
place so
 
03:06:43.830 --> 03:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
that means we don't break ballots up
 
03:06:45.750 --> 03:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
within individual town or award
 
03:06:48.550 --> 03:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
boundaries the ballot is the same
 
03:06:51.190 --> 03:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh no matter who votes on it in a town
 
03:06:53.110 --> 03:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
or city ward
 
03:06:55.349 --> 03:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
um if we were just talking about the
 
03:06:57.190 --> 03:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
party column rotations republican
 
03:06:57.200 --> 03:06:58.230 align:start position:0%
party column rotations republican
democrat

03:06:58.230 --> 03:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
democrat
 
03:07:01.190 --> 03:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
other uh or libertarian or other third
 
03:07:02.870 --> 03:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
party if there was one
 
03:07:06.070 --> 03:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh it would be easy enough but the
 
03:07:08.389 --> 03:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
the language in roman numeral three of
 
03:07:10.389 --> 03:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
that same statute
 
03:07:14.790 --> 03:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
goes on to say that each generic column
 
03:07:16.870 --> 03:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
rotation plan shall be based on a
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
reasonably balanced rotation
 
03:07:22.230 --> 03:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
of party columns within and across all
 
03:07:24.070 --> 03:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
non-floaterial state representative
 
03:07:26.309 --> 03:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
districts those being the smallest
 
03:07:28.230 --> 03:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative districts
 
03:07:29.990 --> 03:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
to which each voting place is
 
03:07:32.630 --> 03:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
apportioned pursuant to part one
 
03:07:34.389 --> 03:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
article two of the constitution
 
03:07:34.399 --> 03:07:35.910 align:start position:0%
article two of the constitution
constitution

03:07:35.910 --> 03:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
03:07:37.750 --> 03:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
and then it says consideration shall
 
03:07:39.590 --> 03:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
also be given
 
03:07:42.469 --> 03:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
uh to reasonably minimize any obvious
 
03:07:42.479 --> 03:07:43.750 align:start position:0%
uh to reasonably minimize any obvious
substantial

03:07:43.750 --> 03:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
03:07:46.469 --> 03:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
and avoidable imbalances in party column
 
03:07:47.910 --> 03:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
rotation within
 
03:07:50.870 --> 03:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
senate districts so essentially what
 
03:07:52.230 --> 03:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
that means is
 
03:07:54.630 --> 03:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
that in the process of determining the
 
03:07:56.710 --> 03:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
party column rotations
 
03:07:58.469 --> 03:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
you don't want to create a situation
 
03:08:02.469 --> 03:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
where in a senate district for example
 
03:08:04.630 --> 03:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh all or most of the towns in that
 
03:08:05.830 --> 03:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
senate district
 
03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
end up being in rotation column number
 
03:08:09.760 --> 03:08:11.429 align:start position:0%
end up being in rotation column number
one

03:08:11.429 --> 03:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:08:14.230 --> 03:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
the statute says that we have to sort
 
03:08:17.590 --> 03:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
that out so that we can spread those
 
03:08:21.110 --> 03:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
towns out as evenly as possible as well
 
03:08:23.429 --> 03:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
and so then we get to the the sentence
 
03:08:24.950 --> 03:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
that is in question
 
03:08:27.990 --> 03:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
in this piece of legislation the average
 
03:08:30.870 --> 03:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
deviation from equal rotation
 
03:08:33.269 --> 03:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
for the first party column position
 
03:08:34.070 --> 03:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
measured across
 
03:08:36.469 --> 03:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
the state as a whole and based on
 
03:08:36.479 --> 03:08:37.830 align:start position:0%
the state as a whole and based on
population

03:08:37.830 --> 03:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
population
 
03:08:39.830 --> 03:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
according to the last decennial federal
 
03:08:39.840 --> 03:08:40.870 align:start position:0%
according to the last decennial federal
census

03:08:40.870 --> 03:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
census
 
03:08:43.590 --> 03:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
shall be as close to zero percent as is
 
03:08:43.600 --> 03:08:44.790 align:start position:0%
shall be as close to zero percent as is
practicable

03:08:44.790 --> 03:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
practicable
 
03:08:47.830 --> 03:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
but in no event greater than one percent
 
03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:48.230 align:start position:0%
but in no event greater than one percent
um

03:08:48.230 --> 03:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
as it turned out in the last 10 years
 
03:08:54.389 --> 03:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
we got much closer to zero percent than
 
03:08:56.389 --> 03:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
we did to one percent
 
03:08:59.349 --> 03:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
but it was a huge effort um it took
 
03:09:01.429 --> 03:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
several weeks
 
03:09:04.389 --> 03:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
to put in place i will admit that i
 
03:09:06.389 --> 03:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
don't understand the formula on
 
03:09:09.510 --> 03:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
how we got there and there's probably
 
03:09:11.030 --> 03:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
only one or two people
 
03:09:14.230 --> 03:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
that worked on that that
 
03:09:16.070 --> 03:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
maybe could explain it to you in an
 
03:09:18.150 --> 03:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
understandable way so
 
03:09:20.469 --> 03:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
what we would like to do is come up with
 
03:09:22.070 --> 03:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
a formula that is a little bit more
 
03:09:22.080 --> 03:09:23.349 align:start position:0%
a formula that is a little bit more
transparent

03:09:23.349 --> 03:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
03:09:25.990 --> 03:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
and easy to understand we think that
 
03:09:28.070 --> 03:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
that is achieved by removing that
 
03:09:28.080 --> 03:09:29.190 align:start position:0%
that is achieved by removing that
sentence

03:09:29.190 --> 03:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
03:09:32.550 --> 03:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
and giving us the flexibility to
 
03:09:36.290 --> 03:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
comply with the intent of the statute
 
03:09:36.300 --> 03:09:38.070 align:start position:0%
comply with the intent of the statute
[Music]

03:09:38.070 --> 03:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:09:41.429 --> 03:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
in as reasonable you know a deviation as
 
03:09:44.550 --> 03:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
is possible if the committee feels that
 
03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:45.190 align:start position:0%
is possible if the committee feels that
that

03:09:45.190 --> 03:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:09:47.670 --> 03:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
sentence still needs to be in there then
 
03:09:49.750 --> 03:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
we would simply suggest that you
 
03:09:51.750 --> 03:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
change the one percent to two or three
 
03:09:51.760 --> 03:09:52.790 align:start position:0%
change the one percent to two or three
percent

03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:09:57.269 --> 03:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:59.190 --> 03:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
and with that madam chair i'll be happy
 
03:10:02.389 --> 03:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
to try and answer any questions
 
03:10:04.870 --> 03:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
i'm glad that it's not critical that
 
03:10:04.880 --> 03:10:05.429 align:start position:0%
i'm glad that it's not critical that
this

03:10:05.429 --> 03:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:10:08.710 --> 03:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
legislation get passed this session uh
 
03:10:10.150 --> 03:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
but it does
 
03:10:12.630 --> 03:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed before next session
 
03:10:12.640 --> 03:10:13.910 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed before next session
uh

03:10:13.910 --> 03:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:10:15.590 --> 03:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
at the same time that redistricting is
 
03:10:18.229 --> 03:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
taking place
 
03:10:19.590 --> 03:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee

i i've confirmed with the host legal

counsel on this
 
03:10:35.590 --> 03:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
because of the controversy over the
 
03:10:37.110 --> 03:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
years of location
 
03:10:39.750 --> 03:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
trying to column from the ballots you
 
03:10:39.760 --> 03:10:40.150 align:start position:0%
trying to column from the ballots you
think

03:10:40.150 --> 03:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:10:41.750 --> 03:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
you would make a reference for what
 
03:10:43.429 --> 03:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
decision was that aikens versus
 
03:10:45.110 --> 03:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
secretary of state was that the one you
 
03:10:47.670 --> 03:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
were referring to or
 
03:10:50.630 --> 03:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh that yes that would be that would be
 
03:10:50.640 --> 03:10:51.269 align:start position:0%
uh that yes that would be that would be
the

03:10:51.269 --> 03:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:10:54.150 --> 03:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that ended up with a judge
 
03:10:57.269 --> 03:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
ruling that we had to rotate
 
03:11:00.309 --> 03:11:00.319 align:start position:0%
order of candidates and party columns if
 
03:11:02.550 --> 03:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
we were to delete this
 
03:11:04.710 --> 03:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
sentence do you have any constitutional
 
03:11:11.110 --> 03:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:15.030 --> 03:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh we don't uh the statute was
 
03:11:18.150 --> 03:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
was actually uh uh
 
03:11:21.349 --> 03:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
passed by cliff below who was one of the
 
03:11:21.359 --> 03:11:22.150 align:start position:0%
passed by cliff below who was one of the
plaintiffs

03:11:22.150 --> 03:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
in the against uh case and there may
 
03:11:26.229 --> 03:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
have been an additional case that
 
03:11:29.110 --> 03:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
um that followed up after the aikens
 
03:11:30.710 --> 03:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
case that required this
 
03:11:33.990 --> 03:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
and so this was designed by a state
 
03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:35.030 align:start position:0%
and so this was designed by a state
senator

03:11:35.030 --> 03:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
senator
 
03:11:38.469 --> 03:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh according to the way that he felt
 
03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
the rotations uh should take place
 
03:11:43.990 --> 03:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh i believe that what we are proposing
 
03:11:46.229 --> 03:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
is still in compliance with
 
03:11:48.710 --> 03:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know constitutional requirements
 
03:11:48.720 --> 03:11:49.590 align:start position:0%
uh you know constitutional requirements
and

03:11:49.590 --> 03:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:51.750 --> 03:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
would be consistent with what the court
 
03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:53.110 align:start position:0%
would be consistent with what the court
ordered

03:11:53.110 --> 03:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
ordered
 
03:11:55.110 --> 03:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further questions
 
03:11:58.710 --> 03:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:00.550 --> 03:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm having trouble hearing
 
03:12:00.560 --> 03:12:01.830 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm having trouble hearing
again

03:12:01.830 --> 03:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:12:05.269 --> 03:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i just pam and if tech is listening
 
03:12:07.910 --> 03:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
there has been a definite echo in this
 
03:12:07.920 --> 03:12:08.550 align:start position:0%
there has been a definite echo in this
room

03:12:08.550 --> 03:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
room
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
from i believe the
 
03:12:15.670 --> 03:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
sound system somehow and the testimony
 
03:12:18.389 --> 03:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
from the witnesses has been muted
 
03:12:18.399 --> 03:12:19.429 align:start position:0%
from the witnesses has been muted
compared

03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
compared
 
03:12:22.389 --> 03:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
or certainly a lower decibel and
 
03:12:24.070 --> 03:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's agreeing it's not just my
 
03:12:24.080 --> 03:12:24.950 align:start position:0%
everybody's agreeing it's not just my
hearing

03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:12:27.910 --> 03:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
um than it was prior to the break so
 
03:12:29.750 --> 03:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
there is definitely still something
 
03:12:31.670 --> 03:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
going on with the sound
 
03:12:35.349 --> 03:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:37.269 --> 03:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
