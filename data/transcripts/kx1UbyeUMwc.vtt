opportunity to testify and present
 
00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:15.419 align:start position:0%
information to the committee because of
 
00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
the number of people who may wish to
 
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:18.539 align:start position:0%
testify there may be a time limit
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
imposed on each person testifying which
 
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
is permissible under house rule 100.
 
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
appropriate subject matter for
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
testifying will be limited to specific
 
00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
instances of where there seem to be
 
00:08:38.329 --> 00:08:38.339 align:start position:0%
irregularities in process procedure or
 
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
adherence to rules and statutes
 
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
and I want to emphasize that if you come
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
up here and talk in generalities it is
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
not helpful to us you will not influence
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
us because you've not given us anything
 
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
to consider make it specific to a case
 
00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:56.820 align:start position:0%
and the specific problem you had with
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
those testifying about subject matter
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
related to a court case or who submit
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
documentation related to a court case
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
should know that both will be made part
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
of the public record
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
therefore subject matter that is either
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
confidential or maybe under seal should
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
not be discussed or submitted to the
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee as disclosure of such matters
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of Statute or of a
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
court order
 
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
and the committee reserves the right not
 
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
to accept written or oral testimony or
 
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
materials which would in its judgment
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
violate the foregoing
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
and with that our valued committee
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
researcher who is up first to make a
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Court Improvement I
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
thought we were the New Hampshire Court
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:06.060 align:start position:0%

00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Court Improvement project
 
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
and then judge Ashley is going to
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
describe one of our more recent
 
00:10:58.009 --> 00:10:58.019 align:start position:0%

00:10:58.019 --> 00:11:00.050 align:start position:0%
initiatives related to permanency
hearings

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the Court Improvement
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
project we are a hundred percent
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
federally funded
 
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
our funding comes through the U.S
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
the administration for Children and
 
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.389 align:start position:0%
the administration for Children and
Families

00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
Families
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
and as a Federal Grant I have a federal
 
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
representative in Boston with whom I
 
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
work closely he and I together work on
 
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
federal requirements for the court
 
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
Improvement project what the national
 
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
initiatives are that Court Improvement
 
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
projects are encouraged to consider and
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
also he's available to answer any
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
questions or address any concerns I may
 
00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:35.150 align:start position:0%
questions or address any concerns I may
have

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
all states have received Court
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
Improvement project funds and have
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
created their own Court Improvement
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
projects so New Hampshire is part of
 
00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:44.459 align:start position:0%
this national movement that began in
 
00:11:44.459 --> 00:11:47.470 align:start position:0%
this national movement that began in
1994.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
nationally the purpose of the Court
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
Improvement project is to improve child
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
welfare outcomes and there are three
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
parts to that and I'd like to share
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
those parts with you and also talk to
 
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
you about how New Hampshire has
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
responded to those parts
 
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
so the first part is collaboration
 
00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:07.019 align:start position:0%
between the judicial branch and the
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
child agency and as applicable tribes
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire beginning in 1994
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
when the court Improvement project funds
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
were accepted in New Hampshire
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
collaboration for us has been one of our
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
strengths there's a very very strong
 
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:24.140 align:start position:0%
collaboration between the court system
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
dcyf we've expanded that to all
 
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in child protection matters
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
so that includes the Attorney General's
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
office Casa of New Hampshire the
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
judicial Council Office of child
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
advocate dcyf and also parent attorneys
 
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
so all of our work that we do as
 
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary and those groups are
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
again National purpose to improve child
 
00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
welfare outcomes the way we do that in
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire primarily has been around
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
Court protocols developing Court
 
00:12:58.079 --> 00:13:00.769 align:start position:0%
Court protocols developing Court
protocols

00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
protocols
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
and I'd like you to refer to the second
 
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.250 align:start position:0%
and I'd like you to refer to the second
handout

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
so we're developing core protocols
 
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.750 align:start position:0%
so we're developing core protocols
really

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
with a goal of consistent practice in
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
the circuit courts throughout the state
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
consistent practice procedures process
 
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
that's the goal of the Court Improvement
 
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
and also of our protocols
 
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
and when we talk about court protocols
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
what by that what we mean is we've
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
developed a document that includes
 
00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
federal law state law New Hampshire
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court cases and also nationally
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
best practices so anytime we refer to to
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
court protocols that's what we're
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
referring to all of that work we're
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.769 --> 00:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
that second handout that we gave you
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
that's a picture of our what's on the
 
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
judicial Branch's website related to
 
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect cases and you can see
 
00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
there we've developed a number of
 
00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
protocols I know it's small but if you
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
go to the judicial Branch's website for
 
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect cases this is what you'll
 
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.509 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect cases this is what you'll
see

00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
we also included on the website links to
 
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
trainings that we've developed when we
 
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
develop protocols we often develop a a
 
00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:17.459 align:start position:0%
video training just because there's so
 
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
much turnover for all the stakeholders
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
so these training videos are available
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
they're between 6 minutes and 50 minutes
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
but they're a great introduction high
 
00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:28.019 align:start position:0%
level overview of the protocols that
 
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
I just want to highlight a couple of the
 
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
protocols on that second handout the
 
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
first one is protocols relative to abuse
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
neglect cases and that's really the
 
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
foundation of our work excuse me what
 
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
does this look like I'm drowning in
 
00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
paper the second handout the culture
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah absolutely
 
00:14:53.689 --> 00:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
so the process protocols yeah yes yep
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's okay
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
um so the protocol is relative to abuse
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
neglect cases that's work that we began
 
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
in the late 1990s we rolled it out in
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
2000 and it's a actually I have it for
 
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.670 align:start position:0%
2000 and it's a actually I have it for
you

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
this is what it is these are our court
 
00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
protocols the initial effort of the the
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
court Improvement project there's a
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
chapter dedicated to each hearing type
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
and abuse neglect cases and it's really
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
the first guidance that we've had in New
 
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for all of the stakeholders as
 
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
they prepare for court hearings and it's
 
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
also guidance for the courts for judges
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
so that they again consistent Court
 
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339 align:start position:0%
practice we want consistent core
 
00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
practice throughout the circuit courts
 
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and so this guides them
 
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
in that regard
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
the last at the bottom of that page it
 
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
says 2012 protocols relative to Children
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
and Youth in court
 
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:48.500 align:start position:0%
that's an example of a national
 
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
initiative to encourage children in
 
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:54.500 align:start position:0%
court to come to the court hearings
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard nationally that kids want to
 
00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
be part of the process they very much
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
want to meet the judge have an
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come into court it's it's
 
00:16:05.329 --> 00:16:05.339 align:start position:0%
their option they're not required to do
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
it if they'd like to do it they're able
 
00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
to come and so we develop protocols to
 
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
set out what that would look like how
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
kids would be invited to court when they
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
came to court what that process would
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
look like so those are our children and
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
youth in court protocols
 
00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
the third handout I'd like to refer can
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
we stop on that handout and see if
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
who inputted
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
to you for this document who'd you talk
 
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.689 align:start position:0%
to you for this document who'd you talk
with

00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
so again multi-disciplinary committee so
 
00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:44.339 align:start position:0%
we had courts input from courts from
 
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
dcyf from parent attorneys from the
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
judicial Council from DC I think I said
 
00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:51.710 align:start position:0%
judicial Council from DC I think I said
dcyf

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
and Casa of New Hampshire
 
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
so as we develop them the way it works
 
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
is we have multi-disciplinary committees
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
that develop these protocols and it's
 
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
not only the group that's convened but
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
we really encourage folks to take back
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
to their stakeholder group questions
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
concerns drafts of protocols and then we
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
came together to finalize the protocols
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:20.579 align:start position:0%
appearing Pro Se some of them to input
 
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
because their experiences we've learned
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
can be somewhat different sure
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely sure
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
um so just to clarify the cases that the
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
court Improvement project is focusing on
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
are our abuse and neglect cases okay and
 
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:37.820 align:start position:0%
so while we have many many
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigants in divorce
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
and parenting cases domestic violence
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
cases all of those types of things and
 
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
our abuse and neglect cases in New
 
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.570 align:start position:0%
our abuse and neglect cases in New
Hampshire

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
almost everybody has attorney
 
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.190 align:start position:0%
almost everybody has attorney
representation

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
of course the agency has attorney
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
representation but the parents by and
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
large have attorney representation
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
except if they're a non-petitioned
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
parent so the statutes in New Hampshire
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
do not allow the court to appoint an
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
attorney for non-petitioned parent
 
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
unless they are a household member and
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
so there are some folks who do not have
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
counsel and they would be those few
 
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
self-represented folks who are coming to
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
the abuse and neglect cases but all of
 
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
the petitioned parents everyone who was
 
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
petitioned with an abuse or neglect case
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
they have the right to court appointed
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
counsel Madam Vice chair
 
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
and what's a petition here thank you for
 
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
that question
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
um so if the division for children youth
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
and families after doing an assessment
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
in an investigation believe that they
 
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
need to bring a court case to address
 
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
the abuse or neglect in other words they
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
don't believe that they can assist fully
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
with protection of that child
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
outside of the court process then they
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
will file a petition with the court
 
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
essentially asserting that the mother
 
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
and or the father or both have neglected
 
00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
the child and they'll explain how or
 
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
have abused the child and they'll
 
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
explain how in that petition it is not a
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
criminal case
 
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
you see these are civil matters so they
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
are petitioned into court for whatever
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
that case is in and sometimes it is both
 
00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect so one case can have
 
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:28.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh just uh for
 
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.390 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh just uh for
clarification

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
um in references Children and Youth
 
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.220 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect uh are youth 16
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
consistently 16 and older and children
 
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
are 15 below
 
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
um we don't really necessarily Define
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
what's a youth and what's a child when
 
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
we talk about children and youth it's
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
just that sometimes we recognize that
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
the 17 year olds don't like to be called
 
00:19:59.090 --> 00:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
children so we might use that broader
 
00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
phrase of Youth but there's no specific
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
definition there are certain
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
laws that do specify what we can order
 
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
for a permanency hearing for instance
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
for someone who is of a certain age and
 
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
but other than that there isn't a
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
specific definition of child or youth
 
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
okay and a follow-up for me follow up
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
I saw a reference 16
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
um 16 year olds
 
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
um so are some statute or or some of the
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
understanding that a youth will be 16.
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
um Let me let me answer that I think
 
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
I've got a a clearer answer than what I
 
00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
gave before
 
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
in a case when it when we get to the
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
point after a parent is petitioned and a
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
finding is made of abuse or neglect then
 
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
and the child or youth Israel has been
 
00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
removed from parents care
 
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:55.820 align:start position:0%
generally speaking there's some
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
asterisks to that but generally speaking
 
00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:00.419 align:start position:0%
the parents have 12 months to resolve
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
the issues and hopefully reunify if we
 
00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
get to that point and we're having a
 
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
permanency hearing then if the parents
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
haven't satisfied the statutory grounds
 
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
to have that child return to them then
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
the court has to select a different
 
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
permanency plan than reunification
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
there is one permanency plan there's
 
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
only a couple of options adoption
 
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
through termination or Surrender
 
00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
parental rights guardianship
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
or what we call Apple another planned
 
00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
permanent living Arrangement which is a
 
00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:36.419 align:start position:0%
mouthful but afla by federal law can
 
00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:39.299 align:start position:0%
only be ordered for a youth who is 16 or
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
older so that's where you're seeing the
 
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
16 reference and we have a small number
 
00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:45.419 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who fit into that
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
category and so we often refer to them
 
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
as our Apple youth very good thank you
 
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
any other questions from anybody
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh yes way down the end there thank you
 
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify about the protocols
 
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
um I think that it was um the first
 
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
Witnesses said they're based on federal
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
law case law statutes and best practices
 
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
so is there really these are a road map
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
for everyone attorneys in Pro Se so
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
there's not really a lot of public input
 
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
into these These are kind of uh
 
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.730 align:start position:0%
into these These are kind of uh
objective

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
objective
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
points that need to be hit correct yes
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's correct and I would just add to
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
that to the extent dcyf has parents with
 
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
with lived experience they would bring
 
00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:33.059 align:start position:0%
that feedback to us that's how we would
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
would get that information from parents
 
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
you may continue great
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
so the third handout and and this fits
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
very nicely the third handout is in
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
addition to developing protocols the
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
next step for us is to say are there
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
core forms that we need to develop to
 
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
support the protocols support state law
 
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
federal law and so we often develop
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
forms we develop standard court orders
 
00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
again consistent practice is the goal
 
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
for us and so I've included the notice
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
that goes out to a petition parent so a
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
parent against who yes that's the one we
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
also have two other forms very similar
 
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
to this one for a non-petition parent
 
00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
who's a household member so that
 
00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059 align:start position:0%
non-petition parent living with with the
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
petition parent and as judge Ashley said
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
that non-petition parent the court has
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
the discretion to appoint that
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
non-petition parent an attorney in the
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect case and the protocol is
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
strongly strongly recommend that the
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
courts exercise their discretion and
 
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
appoint that non-petition parent and
 
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.710 align:start position:0%
appoint that non-petition parent and
attorney

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
so this is a great form this is another
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
roadmap this is the form that a petition
 
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
parent would receive and again a
 
00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
non-petition parent who's a household
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
member gets a separate form and then we
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
have a third form very similar for a
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
non-petition non-household parent and it
 
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
walks them through the process very very
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
well section two is their financial
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility that's on page one
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
section three again this is a petition
 
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
parent indicating you have a court of
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
you have a right to a court appointed
 
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.430 align:start position:0%
you have a right to a court appointed
attorney

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
Roman 4 is telling that petition parent
 
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
that your child is going to be appointed
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
a guardian ad litem in this case and
 
00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
then on the back page
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
section five is is a request giving this
 
00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:24.059 align:start position:0%
petition parent information about a
 
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
request that a non-petition parent could
 
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
make and that request is that if we have
 
00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:30.419 align:start position:0%
a non-petition parent in an abuse or
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
neglect case that parent is able to say
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
I'd like my child to be placed with me
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
and if there's an objection to that by
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
dcyf what that results in is the court
 
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
scheduling what's called a parental
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
Fitness hearing and at that parental
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
Fitness hearing the judge is going to
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
decide if that non-petition parent is
 
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
fit or unfit if the court finds that the
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
position the non-petition parent is fit
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
then their child is going to be placed
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:24:59.390 --> 00:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
section six this question sure so far
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
was that your hand or not okay
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
um under the ad litem I was under the
 
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
impression that the uh parents in
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
question uh have to pay for the guardian
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
ad litem or is that only in divorce
 
00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.090 align:start position:0%
ad litem or is that only in divorce
cases

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
so yeah this is the guardian ad litem
 
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.059 align:start position:0%
for their child
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
but you're yes in abuse and neglect
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
cases again very different from the
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
divorce parenting Arena and every abuse
 
00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
and neglect case the court is required
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
to appoint Casa a casa volunteer as the
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
guardian ad Liden for the child so there
 
00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
is never a cost to the parents to answer
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
your question there's never a cost to
 
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
the parents for a guardian Adeline in an
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect case that is very
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
different from a divorce parenting we
 
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
have to appoint Casa if there's Co if
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
there is a casa volunteer available
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
um sometimes they do not have enough
 
00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
volunteers available then we would point
 
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
a point what we refer to as a private
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
Guardian Ad Litem in other words a
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
non-costa guardian ad litem and um and
 
00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:03.299 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council pays for the cost
 
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
of that Guardian Ad Litem in the abuse
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
and neglect case
 
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:21.419 align:start position:0%
so then Romans section 6 is an
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
explanation of the Court hearings in the
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
process and this is this is information
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
that we The Hope here is that the
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
parents the parent will have an attorney
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
and that their attorney will review this
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
form with them with with special
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
attention to the court process what is
 
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
going to happen at each hearing type and
 
00:26:42.649 --> 00:26:42.659 align:start position:0%
then on the last page it lets parents
 
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
know again petition's been filed this is
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
an overview of the court process the
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
last page lets them know that if that
 
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
they're going to have this opportunity
 
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
to correct service is going to be
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
provided by dcyf and they're and if they
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
don't correct the conditions that led to
 
00:26:58.730 --> 00:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
the Court's finding that's assuming that
 
00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:00.179 align:start position:0%
the court makes a finding of abuse and
 
00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
neglect then the division May file a
 
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
petition to terminate their parental
 
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
rights so they're told all of this
 
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
information at the very beginning of
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
that abuse and neglect case
 
00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
how far ahead of time
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
are they told
 
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
when the petition is filed okay right
 
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
away and they're served uh with the
 
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
petition that's sort of the beginning of
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
the case when they're served with that
 
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
the emergency order if there is one but
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
then with the petition this form goes
 
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
with that service packet so they'll have
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
that as soon as they get any information
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
about the case but then as Christy was
 
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
indicating at the first hearing when
 
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
they talk with their attorney they'll be
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
reviewing it with them and then the
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
court reviews this information with them
 
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
on the record at the first hearing so
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
there's several opportunities for them
 
00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:45.539 align:start position:0%
to understand they served in the same
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
way a process server would serve any
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
process anything
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
the um the police departments serve
 
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
these petitions as opposed to the
 
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Department generally speaking
 
00:27:57.049 --> 00:27:57.059 align:start position:0%
you know in New Hampshire that is the
 
00:28:00.289 --> 00:28:00.299 align:start position:0%
way because it they're in touch with the
 
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
situation a little bit more carefully so
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
that's the local law enforcement is who
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
receives this information and then they
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
bring it to the parents what if the
 
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.029 align:start position:0%
bring it to the parents what if the
person

00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
refuses to take the packet
 
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
then their law enforcement would reflect
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
that they left the the packet with them
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
and they would let us know that so that
 
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
their feet consider the job complete and
 
00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:24.179 align:start position:0%
walk away well I I don't know because I
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
don't do the service but again these
 
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
aren't criminal cases so there wouldn't
 
00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:30.059 align:start position:0%
be an arrest of that parent right it's
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
their child that there's an allegation
 
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
who's been abused or neglected we want
 
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
to have the parents involved because
 
00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
ultimately we want there to be
 
00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
permanency for the child make sure the
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
child is safe and then make sure that we
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
are achieving permanency so it's
 
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
important to have the parents involved
 
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
and they may not initially choose to be
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
involved but we will continue to make
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
efforts the court is making those
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
efforts the agency dcyf must make those
 
00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
efforts to continue to get that parent
 
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
all parents involved so there's a
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
presumption that they'll probably
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
receive the packet when it's offered to
 
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
them but in case not there is a very
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
immediate way to say we have done
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
diligence on this they are without
 
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
excuse yes thank you
 
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
representative kadab
 
00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:21.419 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson and thank you
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
judge Ashley for taking my question so I
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
just so I'm understanding correctly for
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
there to be a finding of abuse and
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
neglect would this be done
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
through a judge or are you saying when
 
00:29:33.649 --> 00:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
dcyf may have a finding of I just want
 
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
to understand at what point there's
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
actually a finding if it's through a
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
court hearing and then this 12-month
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
clock sticks after the court hearing or
 
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
if it's through dcyf it is uh so I am
 
00:29:45.649 --> 00:29:45.659 align:start position:0%
referring to cases that are filed with
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
the court so when dcyf files a petition
 
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
with the court then the court will
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
ultimate the first hearing is that
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
preliminary hearing but then we'll be
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
scheduling the adjudicatory hearing
 
00:29:58.970 --> 00:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
which is as I tell the parents this is
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
the trial on the actual merits of the
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
petition and if the court finds abuse or
 
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
finds neglect at that point in time
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's really when the clock starts
 
00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
ticking because it's by Statute by New
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute it's 12 months from
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
that adjudication date that when that
 
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
order goes out except if
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
there's a request for an early
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
permanency hearing there's always the
 
00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:24.539 align:start position:0%
asterisk so there's now statutory
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
exception we might have time to get into
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I see this form
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
was uh January 1st of 22 with a forms
 
00:30:41.529 --> 00:30:41.539 align:start position:0%
prior to this and how often would you
 
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
upgrade to when you hear of problems
 
00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
with parents trying to understand it
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
we're always
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
we're always revising uh this form was
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
not initially made available in 2020
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
this is just the 2020 version is just
 
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
the most recent version
 
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
so and it's a great question anytime we
 
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
develop protocols judge Ashley and I
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
revisit prior court forms court orders
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
and say what do we need to update where
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
do we need to update it we also do that
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
based on feedback we get just just
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
anecdotally we're always soliciting
 
00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:18.299 align:start position:0%
feedback from our multi-disciplinary
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
group and from the folks they hear from
 
00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:22.220 align:start position:0%
to say bring us information
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
and we we spend a lot of time updating
 
00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
forms and quarter court orders great
 
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative Lanza
 
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
thank you um chairman and thank you for
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
um do you have these forms in different
 
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
languages as well
 
00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:45.419 align:start position:0%
um because I know many
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
many people within uh New Hampshire are
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
from different backgrounds and stuff and
 
00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.430 align:start position:0%
from different backgrounds and stuff and
have

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
we do not
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
um that's a the issue of forms is an
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
area that we are continuing to try to
 
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
improve upon as far as what we have for
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
availability and what our techno
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
technological capabilities are
 
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
um but any any forms that of course are
 
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
filed with the court or the court orders
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
have to actually be in English so we
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
those are sort of our standard forms
 
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
have to be in English we would like to
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
have the ability to have them translated
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
into other languages but at this point
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
they're all in English and and they're
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
generally all on our website again the
 
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
link that the doc that first document
 
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.769 align:start position:0%
link that the doc that first document
about

00:32:36.769 --> 00:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
um the you know that lists all of the
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
protocols is one page of the Court's
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
website there are other links on the
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
website that do include the court forms
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
so you can kind of go through those and
 
00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
look at those forms if you'd like to as
 
00:32:48.779 --> 00:32:51.889 align:start position:0%
look at those forms if you'd like to as
well

00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
just another another question do you
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
have translators available within your
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
court system for these people that do
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
not only speak English yes we do thank
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
you for that question
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
um anyone who needs translation services
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
of course for any court hearing would be
 
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
provided that and then if there's anyone
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
who needs that Beyond either if they're
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
up at the window we have the ability to
 
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
contact someone who can translate for
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
them and assist in that capacity
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
you may continue great thank you
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
the other form that we included is um
 
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
it's called dcyf's affidavit to identify
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
and or locate a parent guardian or
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
putative father
 
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
so that should be behind
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
the notice form
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
As you move through the packet it looks
 
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.350 align:start position:0%
like this
okay

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to share this one with you
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
because a significant emphasis of the
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
Court Improvement project has been
 
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
around missing parents
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
and by that we mean when a petition is
 
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
filed against a parent
 
00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
we may have a second parent who is
 
00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:06.419 align:start position:0%
unknown their name we may have their
 
00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:08.339 align:start position:0%
name we may not have their address we
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
may not have a name
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
so the ongoing obligation of dcyf is to
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
continue to look to identify and or
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
located that missing parent and so as we
 
00:34:21.169 --> 00:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
developed protocols we also developed
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
this affidavit and it's it's an
 
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
affidavit that comes into the judge for
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
before every court hearing at which
 
00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
there's a case involving a missing
 
00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:31.550 align:start position:0%
there's a case involving a missing
parent

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
it's a significant significant issue not
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
to have both parents involved engaged at
 
00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the case so this is a
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
great example of collaboration between
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
the court system and the ndcyf we have
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
protocols we develop protocols on
 
00:34:50.329 --> 00:34:50.339 align:start position:0%
missing parents what needs to happen
 
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
when there's a missing parent and then
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
what does happen once that missing
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
parent is identified and located the
 
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
importance of getting that parent served
 
00:34:59.450 --> 00:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
and engaged bringing that parent into
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
the cases into the case and into court
 
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.870 align:start position:0%
the cases into the case and into court
hearings

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
so this is a great example of we develop
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
missing parent protocols and then we
 
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
said how do we support those and we said
 
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
let's develop an affidavit and this
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
affidavit was
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
developed after extensive research of
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing around
 
00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:20.339 align:start position:0%
affidavits what are other states doing
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
when there's a missing parent and an
 
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect case we don't want that
 
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
missing we don't want that case to just
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
continue without ongoing efforts by the
 
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
division to identify locate that parent
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
so this is the affidavit that comes into
 
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
the court before every court hearing
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
with a missing parent gives the court an
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to know what is the division
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
doing what has the division done between
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
the last hearing and this current
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
hearing and then an opportunity for the
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
court to engage dcyf and a colloquy
 
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
around the importance of those ongoing
 
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
efforts and what they should look like
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
between the current hearing and the next
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
hearing again huge huge significance so
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
important to get both parents identified
 
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
engaged and involved in these hearings
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative catab
 
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
I see that this form
 
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.490 align:start position:0%
I see that this form
um

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question I
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
see that this forum was created in 2020
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
was there a form prior to that for this
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
or did it just start did this um
 
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
initiative just start in 2020 I just
 
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
want to understand when the initiative
 
00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:31.079 align:start position:0%
started great question
 
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
um this is not the first form this form
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
actually began as a dcyf form
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
and when we when we developed the
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
missing protocols we said we want we
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to revisit that form and revise
 
00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
it improve it and make it a court form
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
and the Court's expectation is that this
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
form is going to come in before every
 
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
you may continue great
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
so the other thing we do we develop
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
protocols we develop court orders forms
 
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
the other thing we do is try to evaluate
 
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
our efforts and so we've shared with you
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
today some survey results and this goes
 
00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
to the protocols that we developed
 
00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:17.339 align:start position:0%
coming back to the 16 year old youth
 
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
so for a 16 year old youth with apla as
 
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
their permanency plan
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
parents were were not able to meet the
 
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
standard for their youth to be returned
 
00:37:26.579 --> 00:37:27.829 align:start position:0%
standard for their youth to be returned
home

00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
adoption is not an appropriate
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
permanency plan for for that youth a
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
guardianship isn't a pro is not an
 
00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:35.579 align:start position:0%
appropriate permanency plan for that
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
youth so we have apla another planned
 
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
permanent living Arrangement and what
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
our protocol is set out for is that when
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
when the courts have an apple Youth and
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
at this time there are about 30 of them
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
in the state so a very small universe
 
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
but a universe of Youth at significant
 
00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
risk and we know that these are young
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
people at risk for homelessness
 
00:38:02.569 --> 00:38:02.579 align:start position:0%
pregnancy prison substance misuse so as
 
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
much as it's a small Universe of Youth
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a group at high high risk
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
and so our response to that was to
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
develop protocols and those are the
 
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
protocols on the Court's website they're
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
called protocols relative to post
 
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
permanency hearings for Apple youth
 
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
and it's it's a shift for the court what
 
00:38:23.569 --> 00:38:23.579 align:start position:0%
we set out in the protocols we want the
 
00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
courts to have a more informal hearing
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
we want to shift away from the parties
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
reporting to the courts about the status
 
00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
of the case and we want it to become a
 
00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
discussion really between the judge and
 
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
the youth
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
again these are young people they're 16
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
17 18. they could be out on their own in
 
00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
a very short time and so what we
 
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
developed with these protocols we said
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
we want to help these young people to
 
00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
create some to develop some life skills
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
and so we want them to come to court we
 
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
want them to talk to the judge we want
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
them to take responsibility for their
 
00:38:58.609 --> 00:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
life what's what it's going to look like
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
at the end of this case when this case
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
closes and all of these folks are no
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
longer in their life
 
00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
so those are the protocols we've
 
00:39:08.569 --> 00:39:08.579 align:start position:0%
developed and then we said we want to
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
know how we're doing have have these
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
protocols achieved one of the outcomes
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
for us and one of those outcomes is that
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
these young people not only come to
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
court but they have a positive
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
experience in coming to court and they
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
come back that we want them to come back
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
so these there's a survey that they can
 
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:28.220 align:start position:0%
do online it's I believe 17 questions
 
00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
short should take them about five
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
minutes they can do it online if they do
 
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
it they get a gift card because we're
 
00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:38.099 align:start position:0%
trying to incentivize them to complete
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
this and let us know about their
 
00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
experience in court
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
and so we've just given you some of the
 
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
results from the question about did you
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
feel today's court hearing was a
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
positive experience and why and as you
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
see there almost 80 percent of them had
 
00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
a positive experience
 
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
and then the other question is do you
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
plan to come back do you come plan to
 
00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
come back and almost like 96 of them
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
said they want to come back and as you
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
look at these comments you'll see that
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
it does reflect that they're having a
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
positive experience coming to court
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
they're wanting to advocate for
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
themselves they recognize the importance
 
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
of being part of the process and
 
00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
planning for their future
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
um so anyway this is again an example of
 
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
what we do when we create protocols it's
 
00:40:25.609 --> 00:40:25.619 align:start position:0%
not only creating the protocols but it's
 
00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
some effort to find out how have we done
 
00:40:31.329 --> 00:40:31.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
I'd be curious to know what the other
 
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.670 align:start position:0%
I'd be curious to know what the other
questions

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:40:46.609 --> 00:40:46.619 align:start position:0%
are you said there were 17 questions
 
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
sure and the survey is online so that
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
um again on the web page the survey you
 
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
can access online general questions how
 
00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:58.619 align:start position:0%
old are you was it an in-person or
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
remote hearing who was the judge you saw
 
00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
today is this is it the same judge
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
you've seen in the past which court were
 
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
you in questions like that
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
if I could follow up
 
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.370 align:start position:0%
if I could follow up
um

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
so then there isn't a question that says
 
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
did you feel today's court hearing was a
 
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
negative experience
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
there's not but
 
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
there is not and um is there a question
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
that asks do you have any suggestions
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
about ways that this could be improved
 
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
our final question is an opportunity for
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
them to provide any comments they have
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
when your testimony is finished and you
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
give us a survey as to how we think you
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
did what's the gift card we get
 
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
I would have settled for less but I
 
00:42:03.849 --> 00:42:03.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
but it's better than nothing I do have a
 
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.089 align:start position:0%
but it's better than nothing I do have a
question

00:42:08.089 --> 00:42:08.099 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
um for
 
00:42:09.359 --> 00:42:10.510 align:start position:0%
um for
um

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
Deputy administrative judge Ashley
 
00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.329 align:start position:0%
Deputy administrative judge Ashley
um

00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
reports like this feedback forms like
 
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
this might this be profitably extended
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.079 --> 00:42:31.010 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
um I know that was a push question it
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
was leading the witness
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
um it is we're very fortunate of course
 
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
to have the funding that we do have for
 
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
the court Improvement project for this
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
narrow niche of cases that we handle in
 
00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
the circuit court for abuse and neglect
 
00:42:46.859 --> 00:42:47.810 align:start position:0%
the circuit court for abuse and neglect
cases

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:52.579 align:start position:0%
um there are efforts that are made to
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
see what we have available for other
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
resources that would allow us to have
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
this similar not necessarily this type
 
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
of a survey because this is very
 
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
specific to these youth but to have more
 
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
General survey for court users because
 
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
we think that we can get a lot of input
 
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
from that because it seems like now with
 
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
my I was going to say my research but my
 
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
research assistance research that we're
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
like now the fifth group that's whacking
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
at this in 20 years
 
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
um it could be wisely a wise investment
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
of money for more forms for more aspects
 
00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:30.500 align:start position:0%
of circuit court
 
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
so that this could be an ongoing process
 
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
and not something we have to assemble
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
every five years or so and there may be
 
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
more information about this later but
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
there's a pilot project right now for a
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
similar survey if you will and we're
 
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
really hoping to utilize the pilot
 
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:53.220 align:start position:0%
nature of this that's happening right
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
now to see how receptive folks are to
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
giving that feedback in other words how
 
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
many actually participated in the survey
 
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
and that kind of information to see if
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
we can then translate that in a broader
 
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
pilot project that's in one of the rural
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
up counties that had a year of
 
00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:14.099 align:start position:0%
conceptualization and has been actually
 
00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
functioning for about three or four
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
months now
 
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
um the well the pilot that I am thinking
 
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
of is the pilot that's going on in in
 
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
Brentwood with their some kiosks and and
 
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
there's some technology going on there
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
um there was a there was a grant that
 
00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
was available to Institute that uh or
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
some Grant funds and so we are hopeful
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
that the report after that process is
 
00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
instructive not only for the results
 
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
that came back but but the actual
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
process itself of trying to get the
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
feedback in other words was that a good
 
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
way to do so sort of folks who are there
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
in the courthouse it's not the actually
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
the pilot project I was thinking of do
 
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
you know the one I was thinking of
 
00:44:59.450 --> 00:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
up count up country somewhere in small
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
County and well we've got a few Pilots
 
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
going on and so maybe that's an issue
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
that we can touch base on the next time
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
we come back in could well be thank you
 
00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative ball
 
00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson just for
 
00:45:16.859 --> 00:45:18.109 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson just for
justification

00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
justification
 
00:45:18.119 --> 00:45:19.309 align:start position:0%
justification
um

00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:19.319 --> 00:45:20.569 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:45:20.569 --> 00:45:20.579 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
this uh questionnaire this is just for
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
the children is there another one that's
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
for the parents who um were involved in
 
00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
the same court
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
it's just a survey for youth with apple
 
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
as their permanency plan okay so 16 plus
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
but you are just a follow-up
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
um but you're just said that you are
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
thinking about doing it also for the
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
parents to see is did I understand that
 
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.530 align:start position:0%
parents to see is did I understand that
correctly

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
what I was really referring to with
 
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
Sharon Pearson is whether or not generic
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
surveys are helpful in getting feedback
 
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
on all case types for the court so at
 
00:45:59.329 --> 00:45:59.339 align:start position:0%
this point there is an initiative to
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
have a survey for cases for parents in
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
the abuse and neglect field but we could
 
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
certainly consider that
 
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
um to see if that is something that
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
would be helpful likely we would talk
 
00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
with the parent attorneys to see if they
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
think that that is something that would
 
00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:14.339 align:start position:0%
be a good initiative
 
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
because the Federal grant to fund this
 
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
committee hasn't come through not quite
 
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
you may continue great
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
so what I'd like to turn to now is part
 
00:46:29.329 --> 00:46:29.339 align:start position:0%
three of the national purpose of
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
improving child welfare outcomes and
 
00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
that is for court Improvement projects
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
including ours to support legal
 
00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:38.339 align:start position:0%
representation for parents for Children
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
and Youth and also for the child welfare
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
agency that's the one
 
00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
so it's the it says National Association
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
of council for children at the top
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
so what we've done in New Hampshire what
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
I'd like to focus on is our our
 
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
efforts to support parent attorneys
 
00:46:56.569 --> 00:46:56.579 align:start position:0%
parent attorneys appointed in abuse
 
00:46:59.329 --> 00:46:59.339 align:start position:0%
neglect cases to represent parents and
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
we're really really pleased to be doing
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
this work parent attorneys it's an
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
important stakeholder group for us it's
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's a challenge because unlike
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
the public defender the this group of
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys there isn't a public defender
 
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
like organization that oversees parent
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
attorneys in 169 C cases so a lot of
 
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
these folks are Solo practitioners my
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
understanding from from working with the
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
judicial council is there about 70 plus
 
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
parent attorneys for 169 C cases about
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
70 plus
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
not enough there's a there's a shortage
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
of attorneys taking these cases and so
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
what we said we as a group again a
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary group coming together
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
to say how can we support this really
 
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:50.339 align:start position:0%
important stakeholder group and what we
 
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
decided to do was
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
um two things the first seems
 
00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
it's taken a long time but we we have a
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
list serve now we've the court
 
00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
Improvement project has helped to
 
00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
develop a listserv that's available for
 
00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
parent attorneys we felt that that would
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
be a valuable resource for them a
 
00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
community for parent attorneys place for
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
them to ask questions concerns and so
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
what we're doing on the court
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
Improvement project side is we're using
 
00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
our our some of our resources our funds
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
to pay an attorney a stipend a New
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire attorney to facilitate that
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
listserv we don't want to be part of
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be confidential to
 
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
parent attorneys but we we made it so
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
that we brought it to New Hampshire
 
00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
we're paying an attorney so that she'll
 
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
facilitate it the other thing she's
 
00:48:37.849 --> 00:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
doing is bringing back to us any themes
 
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
that she sees as part of that listserv
 
00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
so again that's an opportunity for input
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
from parent attorneys we also hope from
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
their their clients parents but we very
 
00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
much want her to bring back not case
 
00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
specific no case specific information
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
but just the themes what are the issues
 
00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:56.220 align:start position:0%
the systemic issues that as that we
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
could possibly address
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
so that's the first thing we've done for
 
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
parent attorneys the second thing is we
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
have contracted with the National
 
00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
Association of council for children for
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
that group to develop a two-day
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
eight-hour New Hampshire specific
 
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
training for parent attorneys
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it's the first of
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
its kind for parent attorneys we're also
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
going to make it available to law
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
students hoping to expose them to abuse
 
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
and neglect cases encourage them to go
 
00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
into this work when they graduate from
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
Law School
 
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
the training is free for law students
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
free for parent attorneys all of it is
 
00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
being supported by the court Improvement
 
00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.550 align:start position:0%
being supported by the court Improvement
project

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
and I've given you the agenda for that
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
training it's going to be as I say it's
 
00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:44.339 align:start position:0%
a two-day commitment so parent attorneys
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
it's two days two days eight hours of
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
training and it's October 6th and
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
December 1. and this is the invitation
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's gone out to parent attorneys
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
again that Universe of 70 plus parent
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
attorneys encouraging them to
 
00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:00.020 align:start position:0%
participate in this two-day training
 
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
and if this was designed after again
 
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
feedback we we love love to fit solicit
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
feedback so the court Improvement
 
00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
project helped to coordinate
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
brainstorming sessions focus groups with
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court judges and also parent
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys asking them what are the needs
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
what are the strengths what are the
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
weaknesses how can we develop a training
 
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
that really is not only for new parent
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys but also experienced parent
 
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
attorneys there's a lot involved in this
 
00:50:32.089 --> 00:50:32.099 align:start position:0%
work there's federal law is extensive
 
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
state law there's just so much to learn
 
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
so this is the training that's that's
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
been developed the other nice thing
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
about it is there are two New Hampshire
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are working with the
 
00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
National Association of council for
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
children working on the materials for
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
the training again New Hampshire
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
specific it's going to be a webinar it's
 
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
also going to be available for up I
 
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
believe it's a year like so that the
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
trainings will be offered this year and
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
then for the next year parent attorneys
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
are going to be able to access this
 
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
training and again we've dedicated
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
significant CIP resources to this work
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
because we think it's so critical that
 
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
parent attorneys be well prepared you
 
00:51:11.809 --> 00:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
see there's a section here on day one
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
adjudication and trial skills that's
 
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
something that judges identified as a
 
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
need and parent attorneys identified as
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
a need I think everybody agreed that
 
00:51:23.569 --> 00:51:23.579 align:start position:0%
that was an area where there was some
 
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
room for improvement and so we brought
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
that to the National Association of
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
council for children and said this is
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
what folks in New Hampshire have
 
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:32.099 align:start position:0%
identified it's what they said will
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
really again the goal here is high
 
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
quality legal representation for parents
 
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
in 169c cases
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative Smith please for a
 
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much going back
 
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
the very first page of this very helpful
 
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh packet that you gave us
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
um under two it says Court protocols and
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
training for judges and RSA 169c
 
00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:04.670 align:start position:0%
training for judges and RSA 169c
stakeholders

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:52:08.089 --> 00:52:08.099 align:start position:0%
have I missed something I haven't in
 
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
this packet seen anything about training
 
00:52:15.609 --> 00:52:15.619 align:start position:0%
for judges
 
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
it's a great question and I what I
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
should have said we do a lot of
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
trainings for judges to answer your
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
question we do a lot of trainings judge
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
Ashley and I when when judges are
 
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
appointed to the bench she and I spend
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
three days with newly appointed judges
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
and it's dedicated to abuse and neglect
 
00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.470 align:start position:0%
and it's dedicated to abuse and neglect
cases

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
um part of that training includes Court
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
observation we spend a morning and
 
00:52:40.849 --> 00:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
afternoon in court and then we debrief
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
the other part of the day
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
um it's it's an extensive training that
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
we do with judges we also do ongoing
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
trainings the judges meet every other
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
month and often abuse and neglect will
 
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
be part of the agenda just ongoing our
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
ongoing work our ongoing efforts and
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
those trainings go well beyond abuse and
 
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:00.710 align:start position:0%
those trainings go well beyond abuse and
neglect

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
neglect
 
00:53:02.809 --> 00:53:02.819 align:start position:0%
if follow up
 
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
I am pleased in New Hampshire that we do
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
not elect judges
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
we end up with a theoretically a better
 
00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:18.660 align:start position:0%
quality of Judge than if we went through
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
an election process
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
however I wonder if you have given any
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
thought to
 
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
whether can a Judicial candidates have
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
had any experience in in your particular
 
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
Focus abuse and neglect
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm in this committee we're
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
interested in somewhat in that and
 
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
another broad category which is
 
00:53:49.849 --> 00:53:49.859 align:start position:0%
generally the responsibilities of within
 
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
the family court
 
00:53:54.049 --> 00:53:54.059 align:start position:0%
so that we have
 
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
candidates for Family Court who have or
 
00:54:02.089 --> 00:54:02.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:02.099 --> 00:54:04.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
as part of the Judiciary we don't
 
00:54:08.809 --> 00:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
actually have input into the selection
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
of the judges who are nominated and then
 
00:54:14.329 --> 00:54:14.339 align:start position:0%
confirmed that's really in the executive
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
branch they and so the governor handles
 
00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:17.829 align:start position:0%
branch they and so the governor handles
that

00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
and what we
 
00:54:23.329 --> 00:54:23.339 align:start position:0%
do when we have a judge who is appointed
 
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
to our bench who is we do these
 
00:54:27.049 --> 00:54:27.059 align:start position:0%
extensive training so as Christie was
 
00:54:30.049 --> 00:54:30.059 align:start position:0%
saying we will explain all sort of Soup
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
To Nuts abuse and neglect cases you are
 
00:54:35.569 --> 00:54:35.579 align:start position:0%
correct that there may be judges who are
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
coming in who don't have any experience
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
with abuse and neglect cases at all
 
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
that would have been me when I was
 
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
actually nominated
 
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
um to the bench because I didn't have
 
00:54:47.809 --> 00:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to be involved in abuse
 
00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
and neglect cases and it actually isn't
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
that unusual for our judges to not have
 
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
experience because as we've talked about
 
00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
the people who are involved in these
 
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
cases are dcyf so we'll be maybe a dcyf
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
attorney but other than that on that
 
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
side of it we have volunteer Casa of
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
folks and then we have folks who do this
 
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
um parents attorney representation often
 
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
sole practitioners those it is very
 
00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
unusual to have broader attorneys
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
involved in our abuse and neglect cases
 
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
it's kind of an insular field if you
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
will so it is very common that judges
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
who are appointed to the Circuit Court
 
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:32.339 align:start position:0%
don't actually have much of any
 
00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
experience maybe they were a private gal
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
at some point and so they had some some
 
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
insight so they're often coming to this
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
work without much knowledge what
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
benefits them though is that the
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
statutes in abuse and neglect are
 
00:55:50.329 --> 00:55:50.339 align:start position:0%
very extensive so there's clear
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
statutory guidance from the legislature
 
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
as to what sort of the rules of the road
 
00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
are and then we have extensive protocols
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
as Christie's been discussing here for
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
quite some time and those are always
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
available to the judges and then we will
 
00:56:07.849 --> 00:56:07.859 align:start position:0%
do the new judge training with them and
 
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
then we're there all of the time for
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
support thereafter so I have learned
 
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:14.339 align:start position:0%
from my fellow judges through the years
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
and now here I am sitting here with
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of experience in abuse and
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
neglect cases and I'm the one who's
 
00:56:22.609 --> 00:56:22.619 align:start position:0%
answering the questions when folks have
 
00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
questions on the bench but it is an
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to continue to
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
educate our Judiciary on these important
 
00:56:32.329 --> 00:56:32.339 align:start position:0%
issues so thank you for that question
 
00:56:32.339 --> 00:56:33.710 align:start position:0%
issues so thank you for that question
follow-up

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:56:38.089 --> 00:56:38.099 align:start position:0%
thank you um so you do you've described
 
00:56:38.099 --> 00:56:39.410 align:start position:0%
thank you um so you do you've described
extensive

00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
00:56:41.809 --> 00:56:41.819 align:start position:0%
um introductory training the beginning
 
00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:44.119 align:start position:0%
of the process
 
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
are there and we're looking now just at
 
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:50.089 align:start position:0%
are there and we're looking now just at
um

00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:50.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect I understand we're not
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
looking at the other areas in family
 
00:56:54.839 --> 00:56:56.170 align:start position:0%
looking at the other areas in family
court

00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:56.180 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:01.140 align:start position:0%
is there supervision that's ongoing and
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
is there accountability that's ongoing
 
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:07.940 align:start position:0%
in terms of evaluation
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
of of the judges
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question so as as we
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's the initial training
 
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
but then there is ongoing trainings that
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
we continue to sort of touch upon
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
issues and abuse and neglect cases and
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
it may be that we're revisiting certain
 
00:57:29.569 --> 00:57:29.579 align:start position:0%
protocols certain statutory requirements
 
00:57:31.609 --> 00:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
because we are getting feedback and we
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
do get feedback from the stakeholders
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
that is what is most helpful about the
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
collaboration that we have in this field
 
00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
is that we are able to get some input
 
00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
back about you know broad brush input
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
back about how things are going in
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state because
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are different needs in
 
00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state resource
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
needs Etc or doesn't seem like the you
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
know the the court staff or the judge is
 
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:01.140 align:start position:0%
understanding the process maybe there's
 
00:58:03.049 --> 00:58:03.059 align:start position:0%
someone new it's the security desk and
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
they're not letting the child in even
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
though the child's going to actually be
 
00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:08.220 align:start position:0%
coming to this particular hearing so
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
there's always the need for that ongoing
 
00:58:13.849 --> 00:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
Loop the feedback and the revisiting of
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
the issues and then there is the need to
 
00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
train on the new issues that arise so
 
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
when there's a legislative change for
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
instance events and sometimes we're
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
involved with that legislative process
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes we are not involved but their
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
needs to we need to make sure that
 
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
everyone understands that there is a
 
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
change in the law
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
and this is how it's going to impact
 
00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
these particular cases and I know we're
 
00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:42.059 align:start position:0%
probably well past our time but the last
 
00:58:44.329 --> 00:58:44.339 align:start position:0%
handout that you have is just
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
one piece of the information that we
 
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
provided to the court when the
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
permanency statute changed in January of
 
00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
2022 we provided this handout not just
 
00:58:58.609 --> 00:58:58.619 align:start position:0%
to our judges but to our court staff to
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
the dcyf staff and attorneys to Casas
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
and private gals to parent attorneys to
 
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
anyone who who would take a piece of
 
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
paper from us really
 
00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
um but just to folks who needed to
 
00:59:14.329 --> 00:59:14.339 align:start position:0%
understand that it is complicated the
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
statute is complicated but it had very
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
specific and necessary changes that
 
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
would lead to better permanency for
 
00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
children and it was going to change the
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
process a bit including having that
 
00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:26.339 align:start position:0%
early permanency hearing that we
 
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
probably don't need to go into today but
 
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
some significant changes that came out
 
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
of a legislative committee and we worked
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
very hard to educate everybody that we
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
could on the issues we are out of time
 
00:59:38.569 --> 00:59:38.579 align:start position:0%
but I do have one final question maybe
 
00:59:41.089 --> 00:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
there's one or two more representative
 
00:59:43.849 --> 00:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
gay you want to be in on this on the
 
00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:46.700 align:start position:0%
second page age of this document
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
for the Friday December 1st Gathering of
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
your cohort 1 to 3 P.M this session will
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
emphasize advocacy for reunification and
 
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
representative gay this is an issue that
 
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
is important to you so I'm wondering if
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
it might be valuable for you to touch
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
base with attorney Lamont at some point
 
01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
prior to this because we're going to
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to go forward with some
 
01:00:17.809 --> 01:00:17.819 align:start position:0%

01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect for this training or
 
01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
uh yes and no what I can tell you is the
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
the two the woman we're working with
 
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
from the National Association of council
 
01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:02.339 align:start position:0%
for children she's done similar
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
trainings in other states so she's
 
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
bringing that experience to us we always
 
01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
are interested our starting Place always
 
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
is have other states done something that
 
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
we're interested in doing and if they
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
have we want to know about it we want to
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
build on it so that's we've looked at
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
other agendas that this group has done
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
in other states I mean all of that has
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
been part of the review process
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
in more of the border states especially
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
up north Vermont Maine if they're coming
 
01:01:33.049 --> 01:01:33.059 align:start position:0%
in practicing in New Hampshire do we
 
01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
reach out to them for trainings it's a
 
01:01:35.099 --> 01:01:36.289 align:start position:0%
reach out to them for trainings it's a
great

01:01:36.289 --> 01:01:36.299 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
um I believe we plan to we haven't yet
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
done that but it's a great question we
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
were going to we're actually meeting
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
next week I meet on a regular basis with
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
the woman from the National Association
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
of council for children and we're always
 
01:01:50.329 --> 01:01:50.339 align:start position:0%
talking about how can we bring this to
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
more people we want to advertise in the
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
bar news so we want to go well beyond
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
the Outreach to the 70 plus great
 
01:01:59.569 --> 01:01:59.579 align:start position:0%
suggestion thank you thank you
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth thank you Mr
 
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
chairman it will be quick
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
um is there a fee cap on the um amount
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
of legal fees that these attorneys are
 
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
paid and what is the average hours that
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
these attorneys spend over the 12 months
 
01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:14.339 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
great question there is a fee cap and
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
that is by Court rule that was recently
 
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
increased as far as the hourly rate so
 
01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
that we are hoping is going to prompt
 
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
some more folks to be able to afford
 
01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
really to do this type of work because
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen anyone yet really
 
01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:38.339 align:start position:0%
getting rich with this type of work but
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
at least they can they're certainly very
 
01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
good advocates for their clients I don't
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
think I can speak to the average that
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
the the average amount there whatever
 
01:02:51.049 --> 01:02:51.059 align:start position:0%
the cap is often they're
 
01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
pushing beyond that but they can't bill
 
01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
for whatever they're pushing beyond that
 
01:02:59.450 --> 01:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
so the rates are they have improved I
 
01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
guess I will put it that way they have
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
improved and we and that just happened
 
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.339 align:start position:0%
last year so we've yet to necessarily
 
01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
see the the needle move much but we're
 
01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
hoping that there will be some new folks
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
coming in particularly as Christy said
 
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
trying to get this into the law school
 
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
law students to have them interested in
 
01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
this type of important work
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
if I could just add the there is a cap
 
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
depending on the hearing type and and
 
01:03:27.289 --> 01:03:27.299 align:start position:0%
we've worked very closely with the
 
01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
judicial Council around that cap I think
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
for example uh it's five hours for the a
 
01:03:36.289 --> 01:03:36.299 align:start position:0%
review hearing so it's not a lot of time
 
01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
if you consider the prep work before the
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
hearing the work in the court hearing
 
01:03:41.099 --> 01:03:42.289 align:start position:0%
hearing the work in the court hearing
itself

01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
um so we were we've had a lot of
 
01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
conversations with the judicial Council
 
01:03:47.809 --> 01:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
around that
 
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question would
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
you be able to provide us with you know
 
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
what those caps are and what the
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
financial cap I guess ends up being just
 
01:04:06.289 --> 01:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
you know for example you mentioned that
 
01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
there was a there was a five hour cap
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
further review hearing what does that
 
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
equate to financially
 
01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
um you know I know for example when we
 
01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:17.339 align:start position:0%
heard about the involuntary admission
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
ones it was 150 caps I'm just wondering
 
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
what what the financial amount is if you
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
know we can definitely provide you that
 
01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
information and we'll get that over to
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you and with that thank you so
 
01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
much we may be bringing you back if we
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
wake up in the middle of some night and
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
had a question we wish we thought of
 
01:04:38.329 --> 01:04:38.339 align:start position:0%
when you were here we'll give you a call
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
you don't have to answer your phone in
 
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
the middle of the night however so thank
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
you for coming thank you for all the
 
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
so now it looks like we do not have
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
another presentation from an agency and
 
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
we can move right into pink card
 
01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
questions and before we do a couple
 
01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
little little business items there is no
 
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
meeting of this group next week
 
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
no meeting May 30. there will be a
 
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
meeting on the 6th of June under Vice
 
01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:15.140 align:start position:0%

having our cohort meeting in Seattle
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
on June 13th I think that's going to be
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
court day and we are slowly finding out
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh where and when and who and how and
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
can we come early to look around at
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
things and can we stay a little later
 
01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
and ask some questions so um Miss Daya
 
01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
will be keeping us up to date as she
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%

01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:20.540 align:start position:0%
none of you attest to being nickel
 
01:06:23.809 --> 01:06:23.819 align:start position:0%

say it's Gilbert this week
 
01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:57.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.089 --> 01:06:59.099 align:start position:0%
and you know the rules of five minutes
 
01:07:02.329 --> 01:07:02.339 align:start position:0%
and make it important so I did go ahead
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
and request 10 minutes upon that if I
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
could be proceeding with that but we'll
 
01:07:14.329 --> 01:07:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:16.849 --> 01:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
so good morning thank you for hearing
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
this testimony as such I've been here

prior and I'm here yet again
 
01:07:24.059 --> 01:07:25.130 align:start position:0%
prior and I'm here yet again
um

um
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
so you heard over the last few weeks uh
 
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
several instances you heard from
 
01:07:35.329 --> 01:07:35.339 align:start position:0%
director rimsa from dcyf himself blame
 
01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
the division for a lot of these
 
01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
shortcomings in the Family Division A
 
01:07:44.529 --> 01:07:44.539 align:start position:0%
lot of these delays and uh continuing
 
01:07:48.049 --> 01:07:48.059 align:start position:0%
flaws of our courts
 
01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
um simply a lot of constituents are
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
blaming the judges when reality is it is
 
01:07:58.490 --> 01:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.569 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:59.569 --> 01:07:59.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
we must get to practicalities specifics
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
so again the main issue here is that
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
takes up these courts hearings is 169 C
 
01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
and chins and delinquencies for dcyf
 
01:08:18.729 --> 01:08:18.739 align:start position:0%
as we heard already
 
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
dcyf attested to the fact that they are
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
continuously waiting on criminal
 
01:08:27.849 --> 01:08:27.859 align:start position:0%
aspects on why they are delayed or why
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
169 C's or chins or delinquency is
 
01:08:35.289 --> 01:08:35.299 align:start position:0%
delayed or one reason or another
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
as you also heard that the issue in my
 
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
own is post-conviction therapy that
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
cannot be afforded to me as you also
 
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
know there's a statutory obligation to
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
reunify or terminate within 12 months to
 
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
provide permanency for these children my
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
case has been going on for three and a
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
half years the mother in this case with
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
the child separated has been going on
 
01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:08.209 --> 01:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
dcyf has recently admitted they have no
 
01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:10.259 align:start position:0%
grounds for termination with myself
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
there is no criminal aspect to my case
 
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
there never will be a criminal aspect to
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
this case that being said there is a
 
01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:22.460 align:start position:0%
criminal aspect on the other end
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
moving forward back in 2020 May of 2020
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
to start this off dcyf originally did
 
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
not provide that the non-accused parent
 
01:09:39.169 --> 01:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
um for one reason or another obviously
 
01:09:44.329 --> 01:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
that was during covid it came to a point
 
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
where we exhausted all options for
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
placement of this child no foster homes
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
no residential placements were taking
 
01:09:53.530 --> 01:09:53.540 align:start position:0%
children at the time so dcyf
 
01:09:58.990 --> 01:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
inadvertently went ahead under 169 C
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
19e and conducted the custody hearing
 
01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
for parents not charged
 
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
in that parents on the accused side and
 
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
Casa themselves are not allowed to
 
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
testify adverse information against the
 
01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:19.460 align:start position:0%
parent the only purpose the only
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
prosecutor entity in those hearings for
 
01:10:26.209 --> 01:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
those parents that to be found fit or
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
not fit is dcyf themselves and the
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
parent defending themselves no other
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
entity is allowed to testify adversely
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
against the parent
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh what dcy have failed to mention at
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
that permit at the uh hearing to Define
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
if the parent was fit or unfit was the
 
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
fact that back in 2015 one other child
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
nearly died in that household with
 
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
bleeding on the brain and a broken arm
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
what dcy have failed to mention is that
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
they closed out three open assessments
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
against the mother in attempts to place
 
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
that child into that home what dcy have
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
failed to mention to the court is that
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
they have 30 plus other allegations in
 
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
cases for abuse and neglect against the
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
mother with her other children what dcuf
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
failed to mention that we did not find
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
out until later on that the house was
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
infested with bed bugs roaches fecal
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
matter and urine are you running the
 
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.810 align:start position:0%
matter and urine are you running the
media

01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
media
 
01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
man I'm just it sounds like this is
 
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
testimony regarding one specific case
 
01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
details without provide I mean
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
are we is this appropriate testimony I
 
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
guess is what I'm asking it sounds like
 
01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
a disgruntled person talking about a
 
01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:50.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
yeah I I imagine and I am sharing in the
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
absence of um of the chair
 
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
um I had not realized what he was doing
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
I think that the point that my colleague
 
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
makes is quite
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
um relevant
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
um we are not a trial court correct as
 
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
you know we also are not
 
01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
um here uh in terms of assessing blame
 
01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:23.780 align:start position:0%
or not on
 
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
dcyf understandable what we would like
 
01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
to know is in your experience in the
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
family court
 
01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
have you suggestions about changes in
 
01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.950 align:start position:0%
have you suggestions about changes in
procedure

01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
based on your experience and can you
 
01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
provide the documentation before the
 
01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
points that you are trying to make that
 
01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
is correct and that exactly what I was
 
01:12:53.209 --> 01:12:53.219 align:start position:0%
getting at is the fact that Casa and
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
myself were not able to attest diet five
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
to those allegations that dcyf
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
themselves was failing to admit simply
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
because of kovid being an option and
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
they exhausted all options for placement
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
had Casa and I been able to attest to
 
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
that the child would not be harmed
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
so so moving forward with the
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory process so or let me back
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
up further for a second so obviously
 
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
with 169c 19e we need to revise that so
 
01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
that adverse testimony may be provided
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
from Casa and the other party against
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
potentially uh parents not petitioned
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
moving towards to the adjudicatory
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
process in this case
 
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
we were not allowed to go forth and
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
have the CAC interviewed reviewed by the
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
judge under camera because of covid I'm
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
going to be a good guy and inform you
 
01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
that although you have been at five
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
minutes you're going to get two and no
 
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:54.830 align:start position:0%
minutes you're going to get two and no
more

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
sounds good thank you so uh going
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
forward then we will go ahead and speed
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
this up quite a bit uh so during that
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
adjudatory process the judge did not
 
01:14:08.689 --> 01:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
allow us to review the CAC
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
during that we do not know if the judge
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
or did not that's the only thing I can
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
blame upon the judge is that we should
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
have been allowed to review that CAC
 
01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.590 align:start position:0%
have been allowed to review that CAC
interview

01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
interview
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately we do not have grounds
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
for appeal uh based on that adjucatory
 
01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
process the dispositional obviously is
 
01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
for post-conviction therapy that is not
 
01:14:29.630 --> 01:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
afforded because dcyf cannot find a
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
party that is uh providing
 
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
post-confiction therapy for individuals
 
01:14:36.970 --> 01:14:36.980 align:start position:0%
that are not convicted uh under 169 C 31
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
Immunity Clause any party that testifies
 
01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
is immune from Criminal liability and
 
01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
civil liability
 
01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh moving forward to 2021 the dcyf
 
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
removed the child from the mother for x
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
y and z
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
and allegations of criminal charges that
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
are still pending in criminal
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
investigations through this last two
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
years dcyf is continually attempt to try
 
01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
to place the child back in against
 
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
objection of the judge against the
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
objection of Casa against objection of
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
all of the parties and providers for the
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
child these ongoing issues are still
 
01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.930 align:start position:0%
child these ongoing issues are still
there

01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
so so realistically where we're at is
 
01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
you know dcyf is not complying with 169
 
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
c31 dcyf's not complying with 169 c25
 
01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
which is the confidentiality
 
01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
um there's been a number of issues
 
01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:38.780 align:start position:0%
within this case regarding that
 
01:15:43.729 --> 01:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
and overall it has led to this child be
 
01:15:45.649 --> 01:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
being re-victimized under the
 
01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
supervision of dcyf
 
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
um and that's kind of where we're at
 
01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you however
 
01:15:58.370 --> 01:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
this is about civil court this is not a
 
01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
committee about dcyf correct so that
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
being said the judge has ordered dcyf to
 
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
walk one way or another and dcyf is
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
refusing to follow the judge's orders
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
okay that still may be off topic but it
 
01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
is an important thing and we'll have to
 
01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
figure out what do we do with that
 
01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
information correct and anything you
 
01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
will have my written
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
documentation regarding this very soon
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and 11 copies 10 for
 
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
each of us and one for the files thank
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes Stephanie house
 
01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.370 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes Stephanie house
could

01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
actually thank you
 
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
um I didn't know if there's anyone here
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
from uh dcyf or from the judicial branch
 
01:16:44.209 --> 01:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
that could respond to the CAC interviews
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
and um really Who has possession or
 
01:16:48.530 --> 01:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
right to to those there was a lot
 
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
brought up I don't know if it's so
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
outside but it just was confusing so I'm
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
wondering if that could be clarified by
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
any one of those departments if they're
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
present no there was I'm not going to
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
allow that to go forward because again
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
it is off our topic our topic is really
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
the court the court made a ruling are
 
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
someone's beef is with that somebody
 
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
isn't following the Court's rulings and
 
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
that's a different topic perhaps for
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
another committee I don't want to pursue
 
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
that so I'll be interested in seeing
 
01:17:17.689 --> 01:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
that Court ruling because I that doesn't
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
make sense to me thank you
 
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
that's fair I'd like to see that too the
 
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for your time
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
my name is Stephanie
 
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
you look like you were about to say
 
01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.090 align:start position:0%
you look like you were about to say
something

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
I often look that way okay even when I'm
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
not but I will to given the chance
 
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
children's Law Center of New Hampshire
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you you were going to say that yes
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
I was okay would you say that please yes
 
01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
and the litigation director for the
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
children's Law Center of New Hampshire
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
which is a new legal services nonprofit
 
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
that was authorized to commence business
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of November last year by the
 
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court we provide
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary representation of
 
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
children so we represent children who
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
are court involved in either delinquency
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
chins or abuse and neglect cases we also
 
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
represent them in matters involving
 
01:18:23.149 --> 01:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
special education needs and other legal
 
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
needs that present themselves to the
 
01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:26.090 align:start position:0%
needs that present themselves to the
child

01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
and I hope you have handouts at some
 
01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:29.209 align:start position:0%
and I hope you have handouts at some
point

01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
um I we plan to come back to this this
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
special house committee and we will have
 
01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
handouts at that time
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm here a bit unexpectedly because
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
our executive director I believe has
 
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
coveted so did not want to share that
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
with you so I've come in her stead
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
um so I come from that perspective and I
 
01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
also come to speak with you from the
 
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
perspective of a former foster parent
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
and the current parent of an adopted
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
child that we adopted out of foster care
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that I wanted to
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
talk to the special committee about in
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
terms of the legal process in abuse and
 
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
neglect proceedings is that New
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of only 14 states that
 
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
don't provide children with lawyers in
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect proceedings
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
and what the research has shown is that
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
children when they have legal
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
representation in abuse and neglect
 
01:19:24.729 --> 01:19:24.739 align:start position:0%
proceedings they reach permanency faster
 
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
and their outcomes in general are much
 
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
better and that's why the National
 
01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
Association of council for children is
 
01:19:34.510 --> 01:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
working with
 
01:19:38.050 --> 01:19:38.060 align:start position:0%
legislators in New Hampshire on passing
 
01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
amended legislation to broaden the scope
 
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
of legal representation for children in
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect cases I'm going to ask
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
you to clarify something you said 14
 
01:19:51.229 --> 01:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
states do have this or don't have this
 
01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of only 14 who do
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
not offer counsel for children thank you
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.090 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:19:59.090 --> 01:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead representative so you say
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has proposed
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
legislation on this
 
01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:07.430 align:start position:0%
legislation on this
um

01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
it's important
 
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
there is a committee that is considering
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
amending legislation to 169 C I think
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
it's 10 which has a very narrow
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
provision by which courts at the at the
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
moment can appoint counsel for children
 
01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
um right now New Hampshire law is that
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
courts can only appoint counsel for
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
children when the child's expressed
 
01:20:35.450 --> 01:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
interest the child or youths expressed
 
01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
interest is contrary to the Casa's
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
determination of what is in the child's
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
best interests so if there's a conflict
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
there then Casa is instructed to inform
 
01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
the court and the court can appoint
 
01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
council at that time could you tell us
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
what the bill number is what the
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee is I mean where the end of
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
this session's legislative process and
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'm the only one on the
 
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
committee who isn't aware of this
 
01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:03.659 align:start position:0%
would let me provide you that
 
01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
information via email after today
 
01:21:10.970 --> 01:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
to all of you yes thank you
 
01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
um does Chris
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead
 
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes our esteemed
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
Stellar I'm giving you a chance to get
 
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
to a mic
 
01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
be non-parallel non-parel
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
we did see a bill HB 535 in children and
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
family did come through
 
01:21:36.169 --> 01:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
um on uh legal representation and I
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if this is a provision you're
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
speaking about you said hb10 I don't
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
know if that was added to it but I did
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
do research previously I can send to the
 
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.270 align:start position:0%
do research previously I can send to the
committee

01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes somebody from
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
children to family lot not being the
 
01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.169 --> 01:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman just to clarify
 
01:21:57.169 --> 01:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
on this so I believe it's 5 35 and we've
 
01:21:59.330 --> 01:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
retained it I think that the language
 
01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
there was some issue with the language
 
01:22:02.930 --> 01:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
so we're just working on that but it is
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
something that we're interested in thank
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
you and if I said hb10 I apologize I
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
think I meant 169 C10 which is the
 
01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
current provision by which Council can
 
01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
be appointed under those narrow
 
01:22:16.669 --> 01:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
circumstances so as you look at us and
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
in your mind can tell who's on Judiciary
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
from who's on children and family law
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
you could seek out any of us or them who
 
01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
are on children and family law if you
 
01:22:29.689 --> 01:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
wish to input to us because we've kept
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
it and they kept it and they're going to
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
work on it right
 
01:22:35.689 --> 01:22:35.699 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and I'll just say
 
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
from my perspective as a foster parent
 
01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
and adoptive parent when our child was
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
going through this process she happened
 
01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
to have a was in agreement with what the
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
casa was recommending and the judge in
 
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
that particular case was very careful
 
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
also to hear from her and as the court
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
Improvement project indicated to you
 
01:23:00.410 --> 01:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
earlier they have created protocols
 
01:23:02.570 --> 01:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
about encouraging children to be present
 
01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:04.739 align:start position:0%
at these hearings and to speak with the
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
judges in these hearings because that is
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
a benefit to the child it provides the
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
child a sense of agency in a process
 
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
where they feel like their life is in
 
01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
somebody else's control and it is a
 
01:23:22.090 --> 01:23:22.100 align:start position:0%
similar benefit when counsel is
 
01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
appointed to represent the child's
 
01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
actual interest that the child feels
 
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
like somebody is here fighting for me
 
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
for what I want the child feels like
 
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
they're they have some agency and
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
control over over their their experience
 
01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
and I know from my own child's
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
experience that that was incredibly
 
01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
valuable and we were very lucky to have
 
01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
the players in the system that she had
 
01:23:46.729 --> 01:23:46.739 align:start position:0%
she you know still sees the judge around
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
town and thinks of him as her judge
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
um and so that has been very valuable
 
01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
for her and we just wish that more
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
children who were in this process in New
 
01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:00.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could see the benefits there
 
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
another Point could we yes of course the
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
last uh the hearing that we heard talked
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
about there's only 70 family judges in
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
the state about
 
01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.490 align:start position:0%
the state about
um

01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
lawyers thank you parent attorneys
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
um about how many attorneys have
 
01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:21.300 align:start position:0%
experienced representing children in
 
01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
roughly thank you for the question it's
 
01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
a very good question we've been trying
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
to figure out how often attorneys get
 
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
appointed to represent children in abuse
 
01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
and neglect cases and the number is
 
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
vanishingly small the next point that I
 
01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
was going to make was that New Hampshire
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
has a lot of really great statutes that
 
01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
protect children's rights in these
 
01:24:48.649 --> 01:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
proceedings for children who also have
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
special education rights and needs there
 
01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
are all sorts of statutes that bring in
 
01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
special considerations there's the
 
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
foster child Bill of Rights which
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
establishes many important Rights for
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
kids in this situation
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
there are almost no New Hampshire
 
01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court opinions interpreting
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
those statutes that protect the rights
 
01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
of children in these cases because we
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
have not found a single New Hampshire
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case that was brought on
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of a child in an abuse and
 
01:25:24.649 --> 01:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
neglect proceeding and so these statutes
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
aren't well developed these statutes
 
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:29.219 align:start position:0%
aren't familiar to all of the players
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
because there isn't the kind of back and
 
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
forth about what the statute means and
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
when does it need to be applied because
 
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court isn't being asked to
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
take a look at these particular statutes
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
that deal with the child's rights
 
01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
because there's nobody in the courtroom
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
at the trial court level in the family
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
court that is advocating for these
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
particular statutes on behalf of the
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
child would it be your opinion that when
 
01:25:57.169 --> 01:25:57.179 align:start position:0%
children and family law does a work
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
session on this retained Bill HB 535 it
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to have some of those
 
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
folks maybe somebody from
 
01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:07.490 align:start position:0%
folks maybe somebody from
um

01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court Family Division maybe from
 
01:26:13.129 --> 01:26:13.139 align:start position:0%
the Supreme to weigh in on because I I
 
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
know that the courts asked the
 
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
legislature periodically hey give us
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
something and would it be your opinion
 
01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
that in addition to yourself being there
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
a few members of the court system would
 
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
be helpful to the work we're doing I I
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
think so I think so again it's not that
 
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court doesn't hear 169 C
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
cases there are two points of mandatory
 
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
appeal in that process but they are
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
points that are of significance to
 
01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
parents and not necessarily of
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
significance to the children and the
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
rights that are protected by New
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law for the children and so
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
the the those statutes that are focused
 
01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
on the child's rights don't often get
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
brought up and we're going to continue
 
01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
with questions if there are any and do
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
we have any representative Smith
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you said that you uh
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
your organization was created by the
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court no New Hampshire has a
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
statute that if uh to create a legal
 
01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:11.649 align:start position:0%
statute that if uh to create a legal
services

01:27:11.649 --> 01:27:11.659 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
non-profit providing
 
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
um legal services to the Indigent the
 
01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court has to
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
approve that agency and so we're an
 
01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
independent non-profit agency but we
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
were approved to operate by the New
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court in late November
 
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
of last year thank you very much can you
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
tell me where your funding comes from
 
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
right now our funding comes from private
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
donations exclusively exclusively at
 
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
this point yes thank you do you uh do
 
01:27:40.930 --> 01:27:40.940 align:start position:0%
you recognize any um
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
overlap with the disabilities rights
 
01:27:43.679 --> 01:27:44.450 align:start position:0%
overlap with the disabilities rights

often represents children in special
 
01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
education matters and so that's an area
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
in which we have overlap they don't
 
01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
often represent children in abuse and
 
01:28:14.090 --> 01:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
neglect proceedings thank you any other
 
01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:15.830 align:start position:0%
neglect proceedings thank you any other
questions

01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
the 36 states that have appointed
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
attorneys is there an age that's a
 
01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:27.910 align:start position:0%
attorneys is there an age that's a
commonality

01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
commonality
 
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh where
 
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
they would start appointing that's a
 
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
good question and I don't know the
 
01:28:35.689 --> 01:28:35.699 align:start position:0%
breakdown of those 36 States but I
 
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
believe that that is
 
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
sometimes a common area where States
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
will say children or youth at a certain
 
01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:43.930 align:start position:0%
will say children or youth at a certain
age

01:28:43.930 --> 01:28:43.940 align:start position:0%
age
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
shall be given counsel so some states do
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
do cut off things in terms of age and I
 
01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
think I think that there is some
 
01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:56.330 align:start position:0%
think I think that there is some
um

01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
that makes sense because children have a
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
hard time expressing their own interests
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
and to an appoint an attorney to
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
represent them that that attorney would
 
01:29:07.729 --> 01:29:07.739 align:start position:0%
be appointed to represent their
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
expressed interest and for children who
 
01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
cannot express their their own interests
 
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
that would be a hard relationship to to
 
01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
work through great thank you
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony thank
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
you and the chair would like to ask the
 
01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:22.129 align:start position:0%
you and the chair would like to ask the
researcher

01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:22.139 align:start position:0%
researcher
 
01:29:24.729 --> 01:29:24.739 align:start position:0%
um since we're going to be doing a 535
 
01:29:28.970 --> 01:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
work session HB 535 have have I asked
 
01:29:31.129 --> 01:29:31.139 align:start position:0%
you my usual question of what do the
 
01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:37.610 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:39.350 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
could you send me another one
 
01:29:45.169 --> 01:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%

residence is in Manchester currently
um

01:30:15.169 --> 01:30:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
I want since the issue is one of Court
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
procedure and adherence to the law
 
01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take to the liberty of
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
speaking to you about a case which I
 
01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
know intimately uh some of you may also
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
know but I'm going to refrain from using
 
01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
any names
 
01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.330 align:start position:0%
any names
uh

01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:39.169 --> 01:30:39.179 align:start position:0%
there is a member of your body
 
01:30:43.250 --> 01:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
who was accused of
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect in regard to medical
 
01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.350 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect in regard to medical
treatment

01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
dcyf got involved
 
01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
and in the proceedings of the case
 
01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
they violated statute repeatedly
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh first of all they failed to meet
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
statutory deadlines
 
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
for when the permanency you know for the
 
01:31:10.729 --> 01:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
uh after the ex parte hearing you have a
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
your your first hearing that was not
 
01:31:15.370 --> 01:31:15.380 align:start position:0%
held within the statutory requirement
 
01:31:18.050 --> 01:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
other statutory deadlines for subsequent
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
hearings were also missed
 
01:31:22.490 --> 01:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
were reasons given
 
01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:23.870 align:start position:0%
were reasons given
um

01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
no not to the best of my knowledge and I
 
01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
was in Intimate discussion yes
 
01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
yeah well no I well okay I know yes
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh you said they is this DC dcyf or is
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
this the court the court actually failed
 
01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
to meet the failed to schedule within
 
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
period required by Statute
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
I suspect that is due to a lack of
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
adequate number of judges
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
and I for one am an advocate for there
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
being more judges
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
as strange as that may seem
 
01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
um I think it would
 
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
the reason that there is a state of New
 
01:32:05.570 --> 01:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is to punish Injustice and to
 
01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
provide Equity better than the people
 
01:32:09.169 --> 01:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
could themselves if there were no
 
01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
government and to the degree that
 
01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
you as a government fail to do so
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
um you failed your first purpose and if
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
if more judges are required to achieve
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
Justice then more are required
 
01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
um and I would well
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
different topic but in 2006 I was uh
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
pleased to achieve my first passage of
 
01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.550 align:start position:0%
pleased to achieve my first passage of
legislation

01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:32:45.169 --> 01:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
and it was uh to require that in dcyf
 
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
hearings that all evidence be submitted
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
five days before the hearing so that
 
01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
there was adequate time for discovery
 
01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
the court failed to enforce that
 
01:32:57.290 --> 01:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
and in this particular case they were in
 
01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:58.390 align:start position:0%
and in this particular case they were in
fact

01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
reams of data transmitted to the defense
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
obviously the ability to even see if
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
this was relevant material was
 
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.050 align:start position:0%
this was relevant material was
inadequate

01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
now this isn't a this isn't a sore loser
 
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
complaint because in fact
 
01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
they won the case
 
01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
and and the judge in the end said this
 
01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
is a wonderful family this should never
 
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
have happened
 
01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
so even the judge
 
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
him or herself attested to yes and
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
there's a matter of the court record
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
but the problem is is that the the judge
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
in the process did not enforce the
 
01:33:49.850 --> 01:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
statute upon dcyf and make sure that the
 
01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
defense had adequate discovery now one
 
01:33:55.209 --> 01:33:55.219 align:start position:0%
of the reasons in in in
 
01:33:58.129 --> 01:33:58.139 align:start position:0%
respect to the previous speaker
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
the family made the effort and expense
 
01:34:01.199 --> 01:34:02.810 align:start position:0%
the family made the effort and expense
of

01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh obtaining independent legal counsel
 
01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
and I think that was probably key in the
 
01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
and I think he would the the individ the
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:22.370 align:start position:0%
the uh
parent

01:34:22.370 --> 01:34:22.380 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:23.870 align:start position:0%
parent
uh

01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
would be inclined to introduce
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
legislation to that effect that such
 
01:34:32.689 --> 01:34:32.699 align:start position:0%
should be the norm and available
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
and that there should be a stated
 
01:34:36.770 --> 01:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the for the family to
 
01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.149 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the for the family to
obtain

01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
obtain
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
legal counsel for the child
 
01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
that that is
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
you know the child is after all an
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
interested party in this
 
01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
if there's really harm then the child
 
01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
needs to be protected if it's a spurious
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
case the child needs to be protected
 
01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
from the state question from the vice
 
01:34:58.370 --> 01:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
chair yes
 
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
hello Representatives good to see you
 
01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:02.689 align:start position:0%
hello Representatives good to see you
um

01:35:02.689 --> 01:35:02.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
who were you proposing uh pay for the
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
legal counsel provided for the child if
 
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
the family can in this case the family
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
could I think that would fall to the
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
family but if the family is Indigent and
 
01:35:21.530 --> 01:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
unable to then uh just as we have uh
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to protection in
 
01:35:27.649 --> 01:35:27.659 align:start position:0%
criminal cases I think uh in the case of
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
a holy innocent party there's an
 
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
obligation there
 
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
but on the part of the state
 
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
or private contributions whatever
 
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.129 --> 01:35:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a couple more minutes
 
01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:46.679 align:start position:0%
because I interrupted you during the
 
01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
five no
 
01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:49.970 align:start position:0%
five no
um

01:35:49.970 --> 01:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
I just want to
 
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
encourage I'm going to tell you one
 
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
thing that happened to me very recently
 
01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
and this and this is really why you are
 
01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:58.850 align:start position:0%
and this and this is really why you are
here

01:35:58.850 --> 01:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
the given the frequency of divorce
 
01:36:07.330 --> 01:36:07.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
virtually everyone in this state
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
has been before the family court or
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
knows someone who has been before the
 
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
family court
 
01:36:20.689 --> 01:36:20.699 align:start position:0%
and therefore the family court is the
 
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
face of the Judiciary in New Hampshire
 
01:36:25.810 --> 01:36:25.820 align:start position:0%
the people's opinion of the family court
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
is there a opinion of the Judiciary as a
 
01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.530 align:start position:0%
is there a opinion of the Judiciary as a
whole

01:36:30.530 --> 01:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
and at its foundation this is all about
 
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
preserving the reputation and honor of
 
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
having just returned from wintering in
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
South Carolina I took the opportunity to
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
go back to my town of Fremont to get my
 
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
car inspected and my truck and uh
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
as I was there I met one of my former
 
01:36:56.450 --> 01:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
constituents who was also getting his
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
truck inspected
 
01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.689 align:start position:0%
truck inspected
and

01:36:59.689 --> 01:36:59.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
I introduced myself and then he thanked
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
me for having been his representative
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
and and I said well you know I'm still
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
involved and this is what I'm going to
 
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
do tomorrow be here before you today
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
and I mentioned the subject matter of
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
the committee being the review of the
 
01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
the family court
 
01:37:16.739 --> 01:37:18.110 align:start position:0%
the family court
and

01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
his immediate response like word
 
01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
association response
 
01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
was they're messed up
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
would he be willing to come and give
 
01:37:35.209 --> 01:37:35.219 align:start position:0%
specific issue I have not a clue I I he
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
was just a former constituent that was
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
that was a public reaction to the state
 
01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:42.659 align:start position:0%
much appreciated
 
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
but it underscores what we know and
 
01:37:46.729 --> 01:37:46.739 align:start position:0%

intentions flattery and expressions of
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
appreciation do not count against your
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
my name is Ed Bryants I'm from the

Cheshire county I live in Marlboro New
 
01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:48.169 align:start position:0%
Cheshire county I live in Marlboro New
Hampshire

01:38:48.169 --> 01:38:48.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:38:48.179 --> 01:38:48.770 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
um

01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
my testimony may be a little different
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
because I have a functioning and best
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
interest co-parenting Arrangement that
 
01:38:57.770 --> 01:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
I've had for almost 10 years now my
 
01:38:59.810 --> 01:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
family court experience goes back 10
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
years when a Judicial decision was
 
01:39:04.610 --> 01:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
rendered with a favorable outcome I'll
 
01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
touch briefly on a few key failures I
 
01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
experienced and will ask the committee
 
01:39:11.090 --> 01:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
to have me expand on a few points if if
 
01:39:13.550 --> 01:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
it's of any interest I'd also like to
 
01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
ask this committee to respect the fact
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
that I have a mutually respectable
 
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
co-parenting relationship and absolutely
 
01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
do not wish to open any Old Wounds or
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
rehash hold conflicts I respect my
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
co-parent too much appreciate that give
 
01:39:29.149 --> 01:39:29.159 align:start position:0%
us a few specific negatives that we can
 
01:39:32.689 --> 01:39:32.699 align:start position:0%
consider I like to use my own and just
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
to give you guys a little reference I'm
 
01:39:36.169 --> 01:39:36.179 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the New Hampshire for
 
01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
equal shared parenting division it's a
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
national effort I've worked with time to
 
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
put kids first we've created a
 
01:39:49.390 --> 01:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's a
 
01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
co-parenting seminar as a tool for the
 
01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
judicial system to use when parents file
 
01:39:57.530 --> 01:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
for divorce or custody it basically
 
01:39:59.570 --> 01:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
teaches them to make your kids the first
 
01:40:04.010 --> 01:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
priority not disrespect your ex
 
01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:06.590 align:start position:0%
priority not disrespect your ex
um

01:40:06.590 --> 01:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
I also work uh I'm a board member on the
 
01:40:13.610 --> 01:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
MPS board for peer support I run a
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
co-parenting collaborative group to
 
01:40:19.129 --> 01:40:19.139 align:start position:0%
myself and a female that we meet weekly
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
and have people going through mental
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
health issues because of dealing with
 
01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
the family court system and it gives
 
01:40:27.129 --> 01:40:27.139 align:start position:0%
them a relief
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
my first distinct point is with Guardian
 
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
items I believe we all can agree
 
01:40:34.189 --> 01:40:34.199 align:start position:0%
Guardian items are the ears and eyes of
 
01:40:36.050 --> 01:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
the Court their job is to look at
 
01:40:38.090 --> 01:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
conflict in my opinion look for any
 
01:40:39.890 --> 01:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
dangers that would deem apparent unfit
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
and unable to safely parent their child
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
my Guardian guardian litem and I from
 
01:40:46.729 --> 01:40:46.739 align:start position:0%
the start had an unproductive
 
01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
relationship I was likely conflict of
 
01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
personalities but I was completely aware
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
of her recommendations would weigh heavy
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
in a judge's decisions I was ordered to
 
01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
pay half of an initial thousand dollar
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
fee and then was met with several
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
motions for the the gal limit to to
 
01:41:05.090 --> 01:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
increase the limit I was not being heard
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
and often was hung up when trying to
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
attempt her and my only recourse to
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
reply with a motion to deny the
 
01:41:14.810 --> 01:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
increases as a pro se litigant
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
I would ask for not
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
sorry but Char I would ask the judge to
 
01:41:24.050 --> 01:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
charge the jail for theft of services
 
01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
because she was not doing her assigned
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
job in retaliation the guardian litem
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
would turn her reports more and more
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
negative towards me
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
um in my place of worship I found an
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
unsigned ex parte motion stamped with
 
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
the law office that my my ax had
 
01:41:43.010 --> 01:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
retained it was a joint motion by the
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
petitioner in the guardian ad litem in
 
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
other words the guardian litem as a
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
mutual third party should never have
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
been a party to a joint motion so that's
 
01:41:54.890 --> 01:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
one of the points I'd like to point out
 
01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:55.729 align:start position:0%
one of the points I'd like to point out
um

01:41:55.729 --> 01:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
after four administrative delays and at
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
a full evidential hearing it was the
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
ex-party motion had to do with they
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
considered me to be a flight risk that
 
01:42:07.609 --> 01:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
was the eminent danger that was
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
presented to the court at my full
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
evidentiary hearing almost two years
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
later it was revealed the Flight Risk
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
came about from a Facebook post to my
 
01:42:19.729 --> 01:42:19.739 align:start position:0%
father who had been diagnosed with stage
 
01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
four lung cancer he lived in Virginia
 
01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
and I simply expressed that I would love
 
01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
for him to meet his granddaughter
 
01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
that took my child from me for two years
 
01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh visitations I'll skip that the
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
Advocacy Center I went to after being
 
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
assaulted by my co-parent before it was
 
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
ex-wife refused me assistance but
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%

through that program in adnoc Center for
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%

01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
recommended and provided the other party
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
with a lawyer or helped them get a
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
lawyer it was at that time
 
01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:00.350 align:start position:0%
lawyer it was at that time

that 30 seconds okay
uh

01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:09.119 --> 01:43:11.030 align:start position:0%
uh
basically

01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:43:13.729 --> 01:43:13.739 align:start position:0%
the probably most important point is
 
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
during the time as I was getting visits
 
01:43:17.570 --> 01:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
with my child they were not being met by
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
the other party and contacting the
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
police to help enforce Force the written
 
01:43:25.609 --> 01:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
court orders uh the police would often
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
say that this is a civil matter go to
 
01:43:29.689 --> 01:43:29.699 align:start position:0%
court file a contempt charge those were
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
never dealt with that part needs to be
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
strengthened I have a Texas statute that
 
01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
was just passed that deals with that
 
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
I'll hand it into you guys so it's sort
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
of a template okay to address what I was
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
hoping to bring does anybody have any
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes uh counselor go ahead
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth thank you for
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
allowing me to ask a question
 
01:43:53.050 --> 01:43:53.060 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking it in your
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
materials that you're passing in do you
 
01:43:57.290 --> 01:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the Facebook post which
 
01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
you said you just said I'd love for my
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
child to meet you and based on that the
 
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
court took away or your child children
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
were taken away from you for two years
 
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
just so do you have that Facebook post
 
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
and that court order I could probably
 
01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
get it for this cases 10 years old
 
01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question and I and
 
01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
I respect that that caught your
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
attention I just recently last year had
 
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
five large storage totes of all my court
 
01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
litigation and I had a bonfire I was
 
01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
happy to get rid of it I'm sure it's
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
still court record and if that was
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
important for you and you'd like to see
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
it I could I could get that for you
 
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
documentations of things are important
 
01:44:37.609 --> 01:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
uh people say do you not trust me that's
 
01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
not the issue we want to so be able to
 
01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
verify what you say that when we draw
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
conclusions it is because we are
 
01:44:46.850 --> 01:44:46.860 align:start position:0%
convinced absolutely so and I would also
 
01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
suggest to you and to representative
 
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
it's a uh on the specific uh court case
 
01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you provide to the
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
front the specifics that way we can
 
01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
check it out some of us are familiar
 
01:45:05.570 --> 01:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.410 --> 01:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
even better thank you and and to you
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
Miss Mr
 
01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
um uh Brian's uh if if you could get the
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
information of that specific case where
 
01:45:21.890 --> 01:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
the allegation of uh impropriety on the
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
courts again we want to verify yes okay
 
01:45:27.770 --> 01:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it and it's frankly it was
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
in a broader range for you folks to uh I
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
see the same thing repeated often
 
01:45:33.649 --> 01:45:33.659 align:start position:0%
because I deal with a lot of family
 
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
court and if you know a few people who
 
01:45:37.970 --> 01:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
are willing to testify and provide
 
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
specific things about their case and not
 
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
generalizations about other things or
 
01:45:45.410 --> 01:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
people would be happy to hear them going
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
forward we're going to be meeting June 6
 
01:45:50.689 --> 01:45:50.699 align:start position:0%
20 and 27. and again I appreciate what
 
01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
you guys are doing and that's fluff
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
after I've talked got it thank you and
 
01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give one more shot to
 
01:45:58.729 --> 01:45:58.739 align:start position:0%
Melinda Nicolosi from Cambridge Mass
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
traffic is bad coming north I know but
 
01:46:04.609 --> 01:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
not here okay and now uh chair
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
recognizes Paula wermi you've asked to
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
speak so this is your chance
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
I do not Paula you are recognized for
 
01:46:15.410 --> 01:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
five minutes we mean it
 
01:46:18.050 --> 01:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
give it your best shot thank you sir I
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
didn't even bring up my notes
 
01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:21.410 align:start position:0%
didn't even bring up my notes
um

01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
and actually I didn't have a lot of oral
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
testimony today why is it specific to
 
01:46:30.669 --> 01:46:30.679 align:start position:0%
the point yes I wanted to highlight that
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
dcyf court records
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
are not considered dcyf records under
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
the statute and parents can submit them
 
01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
I think most parents would prefer to
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
redact their child's name
 
01:46:48.649 --> 01:46:48.659 align:start position:0%
and certainly I've tried not to give you
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh children's names or even ligands
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
names in
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
written materials I've given you these
 
01:46:57.890 --> 01:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
people don't know me and I don't wish to
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
out them
 
01:47:02.689 --> 01:47:02.699 align:start position:0%
to the committee unnecessarily
 
01:47:02.699 --> 01:47:04.250 align:start position:0%
to the committee unnecessarily
um

01:47:04.250 --> 01:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
also with respect to
 
01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:08.090 align:start position:0%
also with respect to
um

01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:11.930 --> 01:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
what uh representative Itza said
 
01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:13.129 align:start position:0%
what uh representative Itza said
was

01:47:13.129 --> 01:47:13.139 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:47:15.890 --> 01:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm also familiar with that case
 
01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm familiar with the fact that
 
01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
there was no preliminary hearing because
 
01:47:23.810 --> 01:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
the judge ended the hearing
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
when dcyf was finished with their
 
01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:29.090 align:start position:0%
when dcyf was finished with their
presentation

01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:32.330 --> 01:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know the specifics of what was
 
01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
said because that's the one thing he
 
01:47:36.530 --> 01:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell me I think for a fact you
 
01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
gave us a fact
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
that the hearing was ended abruptly okay
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
we'll check that out too
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
please but he can't he can't legally
 
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
give you a transcript you've made that
 
01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:51.350 align:start position:0%
give you a transcript you've made that
illegal

01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
so it's got to be his testimony I think
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
we'll worry about that okay
 
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.530 align:start position:0%
we'll worry about that okay
um

01:47:57.530 --> 01:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
I think some of the speakers here today
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
have been excellent they've given me
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
ideas for future written testimony
 
01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
um councilor that's not important okay
 
01:48:16.129 --> 01:48:16.139 align:start position:0%
say specifics of a case to us or you are
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
wasting our time
 
01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:19.790 align:start position:0%
wasting our time
okay

01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:48:21.890 --> 01:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
um the specifics of the cases are in my
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
this is one copy
 
01:48:29.090 --> 01:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I I'm in a living situation
 
01:48:31.609 --> 01:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
where I can't I don't even have room for
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
a printer and I'm paying for all those
 
01:48:36.649 --> 01:48:36.659 align:start position:0%
copies give you a question is this one
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
copy ten copies that you didn't staple
 
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
one copy one copy thank you
 
01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:44.530 align:start position:0%
one copy one copy thank you
um

01:48:44.530 --> 01:48:44.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:49.129 --> 01:48:49.139 align:start position:0%
and I I also figured out that I can get
 
01:48:50.930 --> 01:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
the committee copies of even old
 
01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:53.090 align:start position:0%
the committee copies of even old
testimony

01:48:53.090 --> 01:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
um toward the end by putting them on
 
01:48:57.590 --> 01:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
thumb drives if you're interested
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
that'll make it easier for everybody to
 
01:49:01.850 --> 01:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
see and it'll actually be cheaper than
 
01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:03.649 align:start position:0%
see and it'll actually be cheaper than
paper

01:49:03.649 --> 01:49:03.659 align:start position:0%
paper
 
01:49:03.659 --> 01:49:04.790 align:start position:0%
paper
um

01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
01:49:07.679 --> 01:49:08.450 align:start position:0%
so with that
um

01:49:08.450 --> 01:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:11.709 --> 01:49:11.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the two-week break I will
 
01:49:15.010 --> 01:49:15.020 align:start position:0%
Endeavor to submit testimony
 
01:49:17.930 --> 01:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
more in a fashion
 
01:49:20.570 --> 01:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
that you can file it in categories in
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
the future
 
01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:23.270 align:start position:0%
the future
um

01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm certain I'll be back in two
 
01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:26.450 align:start position:0%
and I'm certain I'll be back in two
weeks

01:49:26.450 --> 01:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:49:29.649 --> 01:49:29.659 align:start position:0%
if you attest that you will give us
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
specific details with specific
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
objections in specific cases and not
 
01:49:40.370 --> 01:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
side bunny Trails I will call on you
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
again okay
 
01:49:44.810 --> 01:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
I've had some medical issues this week
 
01:49:47.810 --> 01:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
and I didn't get to the oral testimony I
 
01:49:49.129 --> 01:49:49.139 align:start position:0%
would have endeavored to do that you
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
should have pulled your pink cards
 
01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
because you have basically wasted our
 
01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:54.790 align:start position:0%
because you have basically wasted our
time

01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:58.729 --> 01:49:58.739 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry Mr chair but when someone
 
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
comes to testify
 
01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:03.719 align:start position:0%
for many people even if they're
 
01:50:05.810 --> 01:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
experienced it's traumatic and I think
 
01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:13.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:16.930 --> 01:50:16.940 align:start position:0%
to challenge
 
01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
them and I I hope we can keep a slightly
 
01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
higher level
 
01:50:27.169 --> 01:50:27.179 align:start position:0%
and Madam Vice chair if this person in
 
01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:29.699 align:start position:0%
question were not an attorney
 
01:50:33.050 --> 01:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
and had not agreed to testify with
 
01:50:34.970 --> 01:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
useful information
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
for the first time and went off on a
 
01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:39.050 align:start position:0%
for the first time and went off on a
sidebar

01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
sidebar
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
I would have responded differently
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Vivian Gerard Mr
 
01:50:45.119 --> 01:50:47.330 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Vivian Gerard Mr
chair

01:50:47.330 --> 01:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
do you have a question
 
01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
my question really is about
 
01:50:57.290 --> 01:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
expectations of some of the witnesses I
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
noticed that that pile of paper is at
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
least 50 if not a hundred pages and I
 
01:51:04.490 --> 01:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
didn't see that it was delineated or hot
 
01:51:05.689 --> 01:51:05.699 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think the expectation of the
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
committee is that we are going to be
 
01:51:10.850 --> 01:51:10.860 align:start position:0%
able to read documents like that that
 
01:51:13.729 --> 01:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
are not don't have specific
 
01:51:16.250 --> 01:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
you know a table of contents that tell
 
01:51:18.290 --> 01:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
us what concerns so I I don't know I
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
know I'd ask you earlier when we were
 
01:51:21.410 --> 01:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
going to get the documentation because
 
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
for me my memory isn't so good I kind of
 
01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
need to get what they're giving us then
 
01:51:27.770 --> 01:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
and also I'm concerned about getting
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
that much information in two or three
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
weeks and then not remembering what the
 
01:51:34.129 --> 01:51:34.139 align:start position:0%
testimony was it it isn't as beneficial
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
sure would like to ask a member of the
 
01:51:39.649 --> 01:51:39.659 align:start position:0%
committee to skim through it and if it
 
01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:43.139 align:start position:0%
to the degree and where it contains
 
01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
specific things about specific cases
 
01:51:48.770 --> 01:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
that we will then can consider as we
 
01:51:51.950 --> 01:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
make recommendations we'll keep that
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
the part of it that is not relevant to
 
01:51:55.679 --> 01:51:57.050 align:start position:0%
the part of it that is not relevant to
us

01:51:57.050 --> 01:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:51:59.350 --> 01:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
will still keep but will flag
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
accordingly so that when we go to read
 
01:52:04.970 --> 01:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
through things we will be reading
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
through the things that are important to
 
01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
us lest we miss some of them for being
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
bogged down in things that are not
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
relevant so I I was going to ask this
 
01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
later but I'll ask it now is there
 
01:52:18.290 --> 01:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
somebody would like to take a quick read
 
01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
through that and do the relevant versus
 
01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
other matters delineation
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
it looks like sheep
 
01:52:27.890 --> 01:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman it looks like
 
01:52:34.490 --> 01:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
she did give specific topics in here and
 
01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
then she also gave printouts of examples
 
01:52:39.530 --> 01:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
of the things that she was suggesting or
 
01:52:43.070 --> 01:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
alleging were issues so I I think she
 
01:52:45.229 --> 01:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
just provided a lot of information in
 
01:52:47.209 --> 01:52:47.219 align:start position:0%
here but she did provide like some
 
01:52:49.010 --> 01:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
covers over the different things as I'm
 
01:52:51.169 --> 01:52:51.179 align:start position:0%
looking I believe correct me if I'm I'm
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
wrong attorney worm it looks like that
 
01:52:55.370 --> 01:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
you provided some specific things that
 
01:52:56.689 --> 01:52:56.699 align:start position:0%
you thought should be changed or were
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
problems and then you provided examples
 
01:53:01.609 --> 01:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
of them and and some case studies
 
01:53:05.149 --> 01:53:05.159 align:start position:0%
to the degree that is true then you
 
01:53:07.609 --> 01:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
clerks can go through it and separate
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
them by the specific topics and somehow
 
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
get them into the relevant folders for
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
consideration and it looks like there's
 
01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
a lot more wheat and a lot less chat the
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
chaff than I feared so thank you and
 
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for doing that
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:42.410 --> 01:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
the poster child of copies you've come
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
to my other committee well armed with
 
01:53:48.970 --> 01:53:48.980 align:start position:0%
printouts in multiple colors sometimes
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
we will not hold that against you good
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you chairman and members of the
 
01:53:57.229 --> 01:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
chair committee
 
01:53:59.090 --> 01:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to thank the judge Ashley
 
01:54:01.070 --> 01:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
that came in earlier because she
 
01:54:03.649 --> 01:54:03.659 align:start position:0%
actually proved my point these agencies
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
come into you today and tell you what
 
01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
they're paid to be telling you they're
 
01:54:11.689 --> 01:54:11.699 align:start position:0%
not telling you reality of what happens
 
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
in the real world and they just tell you
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
to go get an attorney and I feel like
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
she was specifically painting myself
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
even as this pitcher and making you feel
 
01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
and look like an abuser to lose your
 
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
children and as I had provided to the
 
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
committee in the past and it's actually
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
in the packet that you have right there
 
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
I have proved that the judges were
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
biased and they were disparaging me in
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
my case the the transcripts were
 
01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
modified there was false DVS false dcyf
 
01:54:45.649 --> 01:54:45.659 align:start position:0%
reports false police reports that proved
 
01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
harassment just in that JCC
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
report that I gave you which is page two
 
01:54:54.109 --> 01:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
you will see that these judges allowed
 
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
constant harassment in my case
 
01:54:58.729 --> 01:54:58.739 align:start position:0%
um even though I went to the Supreme
 
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
Court on five appeals
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
um you got a different outcome depending
 
01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
on different judges
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
and as we all know we've had a series of
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
bad judges in our in our system but the
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
fact that if if any one of us had child
 
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
support and it went to the Appeals
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
who is child support who who in child
 
01:55:25.570 --> 01:55:25.580 align:start position:0%
support allows
 
01:55:28.729 --> 01:55:28.739 align:start position:0%
your case to be put on hold when you're
 
01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
supposed to be getting monthly child
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
support obligations and I'm not the only
 
01:55:35.689 --> 01:55:35.699 align:start position:0%
one in that package I believe it's a
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
last page I gave you Genevieve Ward's
 
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
child support obligations as well as
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
myself both of you have done this with
 
01:55:46.370 --> 01:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
her permission absolutely okay and as
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
you can see that only goes up to 2022
 
01:55:52.250 --> 01:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
and she has at to this day over a
 
01:55:55.010 --> 01:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in arrears I
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
was very lucky I had Judge Karen that
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
was amazing trying to make use of my
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
case because of the way it's come out to
 
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
fix these things but bcss has different
 
01:56:10.850 --> 01:56:10.860 align:start position:0%
categories whether you're a title four
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
the the what they don't tell you is not
 
01:56:17.629 --> 01:56:17.639 align:start position:0%
every case is an enforcement case that
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
some cases end up being a collection
 
01:56:23.450 --> 01:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
agency and they pictured me as a
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
non-title 4 case which again you don't
 
01:56:28.250 --> 01:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
know these things until you don't know
 
01:56:31.010 --> 01:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
them and to interrupt here
 
01:56:33.050 --> 01:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
um you're giving us broader statements
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
but the documentation is here yes it
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
will say where when what how who that we
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
like better than that okay I emailed you
 
01:56:44.930 --> 01:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
it's I believe it was a 15 page document
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
last week after our last hearing that
 
01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
said facts and background which was
 
01:56:52.729 --> 01:56:52.739 align:start position:0%
every single date every single situation
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
and who the judges were on that
 
01:56:57.530 --> 01:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
particular document it's about four
 
01:56:57.540 --> 01:56:58.669 align:start position:0%
particular document it's about four
inches

01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
inches
 
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
of actual backup information and I only
 
01:57:04.370 --> 01:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
have a small amount with me that I just
 
01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
presented to judge king recently so
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
everything that I tell you is true and I
 
01:57:11.209 --> 01:57:11.219 align:start position:0%
have a document that backs everything up
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
that's the secret word and I gave you
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
every document
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
um listed on that facts and background
 
01:57:20.089 --> 01:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
but if you want further I could
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
certainly provide it but what I would
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to um
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
funnel back to is with child support
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
they treat people as a collection agency
 
01:57:32.209 --> 01:57:32.219 align:start position:0%
and not everybody knows that and if
 
01:57:34.609 --> 01:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
you're not considered a title IV they do
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
not do any enforcement whatsoever and in
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
my case
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
I got the letters of wage assignments
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
being supposedly taken I got the
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement letters and all of that was
 
01:57:50.510 --> 01:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
provided to you with dates and Who
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
provided it
 
01:57:55.070 --> 01:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
the problem is if you have this Melissa
 
01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
Pence and Mesa which is their legal
 
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
department this woman put my case on
 
01:58:03.050 --> 01:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
hold just as she did Genevieve Ward and
 
01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
Genevieve Ward cannot take the time to
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
come in here today but our cases are so
 
01:58:11.689 --> 01:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
very close because they
 
01:58:14.330 --> 01:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
change the court orders they put the
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
cases on hold and it appears that they
 
01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
have more power than these judges have
 
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
do they provide reasons for putting them
 
01:58:24.770 --> 01:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
on hold yeah they told me that because I
 
01:58:27.410 --> 01:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
my case was in appeals which I've been
 
01:58:29.209 --> 01:58:29.219 align:start position:0%
in the court system for nine years so
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
that just tells you where my child
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
support has been on hold for nine years
 
01:58:37.070 --> 01:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they're the change in
 
01:58:39.890 --> 01:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
these orders around and on my case which
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
I gave you they come up with these these
 
01:58:45.290 --> 01:58:45.300 align:start position:0%
positive balances and with no
 
01:58:47.209 --> 01:58:47.219 align:start position:0%
explanation so that it looks like you
 
01:58:48.770 --> 01:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
got all these credits on your account
 
01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
and when you challenge that you ask for
 
01:58:52.970 --> 01:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
an audit you ask for a supervisory
 
01:58:55.250 --> 01:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
review you asked for the judicial
 
01:58:58.129 --> 01:58:58.139 align:start position:0%
hearings and I even asked for a right to
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
know which I also gave to you that was
 
01:59:03.490 --> 01:59:03.500 align:start position:0%
in March I've been asking for this since
 
01:59:07.970 --> 01:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
2016. there is no procedure for while
 
01:59:10.370 --> 01:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
something's under repeal the money to be
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
paid into an escrow account no no they
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
just stop everything all together and
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
whatever was the previous one that
 
01:59:21.169 --> 01:59:21.179 align:start position:0%
nobody argued on and in my case it was
 
01:59:26.030 --> 01:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
in the amount of 533 dollars so in 2021
 
01:59:28.370 --> 01:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
it's changed many times along the way
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
but 2021 is when we finally got it to
 
01:59:36.050 --> 01:59:36.060 align:start position:0%
the point that my case law wasn't too
 
01:59:38.209 --> 01:59:38.219 align:start position:0%
much it was into effect but the point
 
01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
being here is even like when I request
 
01:59:42.530 --> 01:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
the right to know the process I used
 
01:59:44.209 --> 01:59:44.219 align:start position:0%
from Mount ruthia which you'll have his
 
01:59:46.430 --> 01:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
testimony as well he got his information
 
01:59:49.250 --> 01:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
I didn't get mine but it just seems
 
01:59:51.410 --> 01:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
weird because bcss says they have no
 
01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
interest in these cases and I just don't
 
01:59:55.790 --> 01:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
see anything that's consistent I don't
 
01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
see that what they're telling us is true
 
02:00:00.169 --> 02:00:00.179 align:start position:0%
to their word okay good thank you thank
 
02:00:02.089 --> 02:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
you thank you now a couple things um
 
02:00:04.970 --> 02:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
first of all uh Ms Ward you referenced
 
02:00:07.729 --> 02:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
who couldn't be here could she send us a
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
one or two pager with her specific case
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
so it's the same kind of deal but with
 
02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
the specifics listed so that we could
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
put that in the folder and secondly uh
 
02:00:24.290 --> 02:00:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
I want to compliment you this is usable
 
02:00:29.930 --> 02:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
information this is
 
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
um stuff that's going in the folder to
 
02:00:34.370 --> 02:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
be considered when we look at specific
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:47.930 --> 02:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes uh Randall Collier from
 
02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:50.030 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes uh Randall Collier from
sorry

02:00:50.030 --> 02:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:00:53.870 --> 02:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
to come on up if that's you
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
to the last person on the end you know
 
02:00:58.430 --> 02:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
if this was a quiz show I'd say come on
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
down but you may address the group
 
02:01:02.689 --> 02:01:02.699 align:start position:0%
you're going to turn need to turn the
 
02:01:10.250 --> 02:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:12.169 --> 02:01:12.179 align:start position:0%
good morning special committee thank you
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
for hearing me Randall Collier from Keen
 
02:01:16.490 --> 02:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
um just want to give you an update uh
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
from my common law Rita Satori that I
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
submitted to Supreme Court
 
02:01:23.930 --> 02:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
um last month they actually denied
 
02:01:25.450 --> 02:01:25.460 align:start position:0%
um the appeal
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
for the false allegations of domestic
 
02:01:29.689 --> 02:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
violence and that was the paper that I
 
02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
gave you and I was a uh the Supreme
 
02:01:33.649 --> 02:01:33.659 align:start position:0%
Court rules for extensions for
 
02:01:36.290 --> 02:01:36.300 align:start position:0%
reconsideration to file the appeal uh
 
02:01:37.970 --> 02:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said it was discretionary
 
02:01:39.290 --> 02:01:39.300 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't within the 30-day
 
02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:42.300 align:start position:0%
window however it had all questions of
 
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
law in it
 
02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
um and I was just curious like I'm not
 
02:01:48.169 --> 02:01:48.179 align:start position:0%
really familiar with the dcyf part but
 
02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
if the if the judge takes the kids away
 
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
from the dcyf for abuse
 
02:01:57.530 --> 02:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
does that go to a criminal court or does
 
02:01:59.810 --> 02:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
that stay in the equity court if anybody
 
02:02:01.729 --> 02:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
has an answer to that later on and I'm
 
02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
02:02:05.209 --> 02:02:05.219 align:start position:0%
um but if it is Criminal Court then why
 
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
is it separated when they separate
 
02:02:10.030 --> 02:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
parents in equity Court without abuse
 
02:02:14.270 --> 02:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's a good question to find out
 
02:02:15.709 --> 02:02:15.719 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to give you the
 
02:02:21.410 --> 02:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:27.649 --> 02:02:27.659 align:start position:0%
to to
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
um dovetail on on that question I wonder
 
02:02:32.330 --> 02:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes too because
 
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
uh when you start making some serious
 
02:02:39.169 --> 02:02:39.179 align:start position:0%
accusations against somebody uh
 
02:02:41.450 --> 02:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
that can slop over into a criminal
 
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
complaint and yet
 
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
the rules are still family I mean
 
02:02:49.129 --> 02:02:49.139 align:start position:0%
there's a gray area there that needs to
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
be addressed in my opinion but that's
 
02:02:55.010 --> 02:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
just me okay Madam Vice chair it's all
 
02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:59.390 align:start position:0%
just me okay Madam Vice chair it's all
yours

02:02:59.390 --> 02:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:13.850 align:start position:0%
 
here

02:03:13.850 --> 02:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:27.050 --> 02:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam Vice chair
 
02:03:33.410 --> 02:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to follow up with a very
 
02:03:36.050 --> 02:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
positive suggestion that I heard last
 
02:03:38.050 --> 02:03:38.060 align:start position:0%
time from Miss bartello
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
involving uh offering more support staff
 
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
to judges possibly in the form of
 
02:03:47.629 --> 02:03:47.639 align:start position:0%
clerk's paralegals and not what and what
 
02:03:47.639 --> 02:03:48.669 align:start position:0%
clerk's paralegals and not what and what
not

02:03:48.669 --> 02:03:48.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
in support of that very positive
 
02:03:54.109 --> 02:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
suggestion I'd like to offer a specific
 
02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
case slice
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
as to why I believe that's
 
02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:01.370 align:start position:0%
as to why I believe that's
uh

02:04:01.370 --> 02:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
really necessary
 
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
you've heard testimony from Miss Silva
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
about a wonderful jurist
 
02:04:13.250 --> 02:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh I've sat through many hearings
 
02:04:14.930 --> 02:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
presided over
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh by that officer and I think he does a
 
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
wonderful job but in my case he was
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
simply overworked
 
02:04:24.239 --> 02:04:26.209 align:start position:0%
simply overworked
and

02:04:26.209 --> 02:04:26.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:30.050 --> 02:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
the issue I'm raising is a very poor
 
02:04:36.530 --> 02:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
order from an otherwise very good judge
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
quite specifically on December 18 2020
 
02:04:42.410 --> 02:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
which is a Friday
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
the other party filed a motion for an
 
02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
extension of a protective order it was
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
not even marked ex parte
 
02:04:56.930 --> 02:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
and by Monday morning that was sort of
 
02:05:00.490 --> 02:05:00.500 align:start position:0%
rubber stamped and granted
 
02:05:05.330 --> 02:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
certainly I have a remedy on appeal and
 
02:05:07.129 --> 02:05:07.139 align:start position:0%
you know was able to get a positive
 
02:05:10.089 --> 02:05:10.099 align:start position:0%
order out of our Supreme Court
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
regarding that
 
02:05:16.669 --> 02:05:16.679 align:start position:0%
but I would respectfully suggest
 
02:05:20.570 --> 02:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
go through all of that just having some
 
02:05:27.169 --> 02:05:27.179 align:start position:0%
more resources where he had time to
 
02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
actually read that where he had time to
 
02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
hear from both sides
 
02:05:36.109 --> 02:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
where there was time to really figure it
 
02:05:36.119 --> 02:05:37.010 align:start position:0%
where there was time to really figure it
out

02:05:37.010 --> 02:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:38.390 align:start position:0%
out
uh

02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:40.970 --> 02:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
before it went up on appeal might have
 
02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
been a much more cost effective
 
02:05:46.129 --> 02:05:46.139 align:start position:0%
and better remedy
 
02:05:49.970 --> 02:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
and I would also remark uh begin with
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
regard to this jurist
 
02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:53.450 align:start position:0%
regard to this jurist
um

02:05:53.450 --> 02:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
before the
 
02:05:59.450 --> 02:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
Joint Committee where chief justice
 
02:06:03.410 --> 02:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
McDonald gave his presentation uh you
 
02:06:05.570 --> 02:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
also heard testimony from Miss ortolano
 
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
in which she won her case before you
 
02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
know this judge yet filed a complaint
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
anyway simply because it took so long
 
02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:19.010 align:start position:0%
anyway simply because it took so long
and

02:06:19.010 --> 02:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:21.129 --> 02:06:21.139 align:start position:0%
you know that's just there to support
 
02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
these good people really need the
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
resources they need to get it right at
 
02:06:31.490 --> 02:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
the trial court level
 
02:06:33.709 --> 02:06:33.719 align:start position:0%
so that an appellate court doesn't have
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's about all I have
 
02:06:43.129 --> 02:06:43.139 align:start position:0%
to say on that I can get you a copy of
 
02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
that specific order again December
 
02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:46.810 align:start position:0%
that specific order again December
Friday

02:06:46.810 --> 02:06:46.820 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
02:06:52.010 --> 02:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
December 18 2020 granted Monday
 
02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:56.719 align:start position:0%
December 21st 2020 without any input
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
from the other side and to this day I
 
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
still don't even know the reason it was
 
02:07:04.729 --> 02:07:04.739 align:start position:0%
granted there was no narrative it just
 
02:07:07.729 --> 02:07:07.739 align:start position:0%
says granted and whereas the statute
 
02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
says the court shall state in writing
 
02:07:11.810 --> 02:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
you know it's reasons or reasons and we
 
02:07:13.970 --> 02:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
never got that in its two and a half
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
years later
 
02:07:17.209 --> 02:07:17.219 align:start position:0%
and again
 
02:07:19.729 --> 02:07:19.739 align:start position:0%
you know it's about overwork I think on
 
02:07:22.910 --> 02:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
this order not about
 
02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
any sort of malfeasance on the part of
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
the the judicial officer
 
02:07:29.209 --> 02:07:29.219 align:start position:0%
with that said I'll take any questions
 
02:07:31.250 --> 02:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
02:07:33.589 --> 02:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
questions from my colleagues
 
02:07:36.530 --> 02:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
yes representative law uh thank you
 
02:07:38.689 --> 02:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh
 
02:07:41.689 --> 02:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
the uh well you referenced the 12 2020
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
and the granted on the 21st uh did you I
 
02:07:49.010 --> 02:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
I thought I saw something
 
02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
um familiar to that that you had already
 
02:07:53.330 --> 02:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
submitted with us was that already
 
02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
submitted to us uh no that's not
 
02:07:57.490 --> 02:07:57.500 align:start position:0%
something I've submitted
 
02:07:59.930 --> 02:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
this is separate I'll need to submitted
 
02:08:03.229 --> 02:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
and it's essentially a specific slice to
 
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
really support Miss partello's testimony
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
from the last hearing all right thank
 
02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:08.209 align:start position:0%

thank you the chair recognizes Robert
tangway

02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:32.330 --> 02:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
excuse me you just turned the mic off
 
02:08:33.770 --> 02:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
I thought I understood what was going on
 
02:08:36.290 --> 02:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam uh Vice chair I
 
02:08:38.030 --> 02:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
believe Smith
 
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
um my name is Robert Tanguay I have uh
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
I would like to thank you all for being
 
02:08:44.810 --> 02:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
here this is very important
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I have a two-pronged testimony one is
 
02:08:50.530 --> 02:08:50.540 align:start position:0%
going to be about my personal experience
 
02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh in my life growing up as a fatherless
 
02:08:57.530 --> 02:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
child and the second will be my
 
02:09:00.109 --> 02:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
experience with the court system now how
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
they are not following rules I've been
 
02:09:04.010 --> 02:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
looking up the specific statutes
 
02:09:06.290 --> 02:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
um I I respect
 
02:09:09.290 --> 02:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
your the importance of of your own life
 
02:09:12.729 --> 02:09:12.739 align:start position:0%
experience but here we need to focus
 
02:09:16.189 --> 02:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
exclusively on the Family Court
 
02:09:16.199 --> 02:09:17.390 align:start position:0%
exclusively on the Family Court
right

02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:09:19.250 --> 02:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
so and I understand
 
02:09:22.189 --> 02:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
um Madam uh and I believe that does is
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
relevant um in uh
 
02:09:28.490 --> 02:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
reference to Mr albrecht's testimony I
 
02:09:32.330 --> 02:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
believe it's kind of the 14th article of
 
02:09:34.609 --> 02:09:34.619 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution articles
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
I mean uh remedies are to be free prompt
 
02:09:40.370 --> 02:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
and without denial so basically what's
 
02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
happening is the court is overworking
 
02:09:44.450 --> 02:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
and you will find that this is for
 
02:09:48.649 --> 02:09:48.659 align:start position:0%
specifically at Pro Se individuals and
 
02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
so that's something that we need to uh
 
02:09:55.250 --> 02:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
work into I'm going to ask the uh this
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
group to actually have me come and speak
 
02:10:00.530 --> 02:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
for a period of time 30 minutes which I
 
02:10:03.850 --> 02:10:03.860 align:start position:0%
will provide actual facts and a report
 
02:10:07.310 --> 02:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
and I will do that in writing so uh
 
02:10:11.089 --> 02:10:11.099 align:start position:0%
specifically to answer uh Madam chair
 
02:10:11.099 --> 02:10:12.350 align:start position:0%
specifically to answer uh Madam chair
Smith

02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:13.129 align:start position:0%
Smith
um

02:10:13.129 --> 02:10:13.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:15.010 --> 02:10:15.020 align:start position:0%
what we have
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
is I looked up 173b and the court has
 
02:10:22.729 --> 02:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
issued orders specifically that are in
 
02:10:28.270 --> 02:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
violation of 173 B Section 3 and the
 
02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
opposing part a council who never even
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
filed an appearance in either case which
 
02:10:38.709 --> 02:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:41.330 --> 02:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
recommended that I use our family wizard
 
02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
which would violate
 
02:10:47.109 --> 02:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
the protection order and if you look at
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:55.250 --> 02:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
section three it says if either party
 
02:10:58.189 --> 02:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
Wishes the defendant to be excused from
 
02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
any provision of an order of protection
 
02:11:03.050 --> 02:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
the remedy is to petition the court for
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
modification modification of such order
 
02:11:08.990 --> 02:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
specifically so that a court can't give
 
02:11:11.810 --> 02:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
out another order they must modify the
 
02:11:13.550 --> 02:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
order which is sent to the police and by
 
02:11:15.709 --> 02:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
the way I did not commit domestic
 
02:11:15.719 --> 02:11:17.149 align:start position:0%
the way I did not commit domestic
violence

02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
violence
 
02:11:17.159 --> 02:11:19.910 align:start position:0%
violence
um so

02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:22.010 --> 02:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
there are many such orders uh things
 
02:11:25.070 --> 02:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
that have happened and I can provide the
 
02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
specifics everything I say I can back up
 
02:11:29.570 --> 02:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
in paperwork writing it's with the
 
02:11:33.229 --> 02:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
courts they're just brushing us aside
 
02:11:33.239 --> 02:11:34.550 align:start position:0%
courts they're just brushing us aside
um

02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
so myself in relation to today's
 
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
testimony I
 
02:11:43.729 --> 02:11:43.739 align:start position:0%
my mother left my father when I was one
 
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
month old I did not meet him until I was
 
02:11:49.129 --> 02:11:49.139 align:start position:0%
14 years old he died when I was 18. I
 
02:11:51.169 --> 02:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
had no relationship with him
 
02:11:51.179 --> 02:11:53.209 align:start position:0%
had no relationship with him
uh

02:11:53.209 --> 02:11:53.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:57.229 --> 02:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
I worked down the street at Radio Shack
 
02:11:59.330 --> 02:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
in Concord when there was Radio Shack on
 
02:12:02.570 --> 02:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
Main Street I know the state I know this
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
this world and and the pain that I went
 
02:12:07.490 --> 02:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
through not having a father
 
02:12:10.729 --> 02:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
is the most important
 
02:12:12.890 --> 02:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
I mean it's just it's so hard I had all
 
02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
the ways that I would present that
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and I've cried by myself
 
02:12:21.050 --> 02:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
um but it's
 
02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
we have everybody who's testifying they
 
02:12:24.830 --> 02:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
want to be part of their children's
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
lives and they have they do not want to
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
be here no one wants to be in court no
 
02:12:31.370 --> 02:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
one wants to be here and that's why I
 
02:12:32.990 --> 02:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
honor you for doing the job that you're
 
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:34.430 align:start position:0%
honor you for doing the job that you're
doing

02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
um but there've been
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
besieged by a
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
profiteering type of business that is
 
02:12:46.609 --> 02:12:46.619 align:start position:0%
everybody does what is in their own
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
perceived best interest and when women
 
02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
or fathers It's usually the person with
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
the better family that gets the children
 
02:12:55.729 --> 02:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
whoever can demonstrate that they have
 
02:12:58.490 --> 02:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
the most money legal resources and I've
 
02:13:00.410 --> 02:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
seen it could you provide documentation
 
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
for that please
 
02:13:04.189 --> 02:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
uh yes I could I could we could do a
 
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
study and it would be something no no we
 
02:13:10.490 --> 02:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
you know there was a president
 
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago who had a very
 
02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:13.790 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago who had a very
good

02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:15.370 align:start position:0%
good
um

02:13:15.370 --> 02:13:15.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:18.410 --> 02:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
rubric which he operated under he said
 
02:13:23.089 --> 02:13:23.099 align:start position:0%
trust but verify we need to verify what
 
02:13:26.330 --> 02:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
we need from you understanding that each
 
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
of us you and and each of us have had
 
02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
our own life experiences and they color
 
02:13:36.109 --> 02:13:36.119 align:start position:0%
how we see things we understand that and
 
02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
it's important and in no way am I
 
02:13:42.250 --> 02:13:42.260 align:start position:0%
minimizing it but here we are looking at
 
02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
how the family court functions and we
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
need to know
 
02:13:52.790 --> 02:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
not what your life experience was not
 
02:13:56.450 --> 02:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
what your predisposition is but just the
 
02:13:59.209 --> 02:13:59.219 align:start position:0%
facts we need the facts that show us
 
02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
where the court is doing a good job and
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
where the court is not doing a good job
 
02:14:07.250 --> 02:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
where we could do something
 
02:14:10.189 --> 02:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
to correct those problems and I
 
02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
understand that um so I made several
 
02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations and I would that's why I
 
02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
do ask that I am given more time to
 
02:14:18.530 --> 02:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
present such as the lobbyist that
 
02:14:21.290 --> 02:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
presented last week for the uh domestic
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
violence uh Lobby
 
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
um she was a lobbyist and she said stuff
 
02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
I believe people are actually trying to
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
do things but I have everything uh that
 
02:14:33.050 --> 02:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
I'm saying to back up there are studies
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
and in my own experience and filings
 
02:14:37.370 --> 02:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
with the court I have created a record
 
02:14:40.189 --> 02:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
which verifies such but I can understand
 
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
how we need actual facts
 
02:14:45.229 --> 02:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
um and the court is being presented with
 
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
such facts and you'll see
 
02:14:49.970 --> 02:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
that when they're presented with such
 
02:14:52.490 --> 02:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
facts they don't know the law they
 
02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
violate the law and do so at the expense
 
02:14:58.790 --> 02:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
of pro se litigants because they can get
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
away with it could you show us the
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
documentation please certainly
 
02:15:05.930 --> 02:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:07.729 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:15:09.410 --> 02:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:15:11.450 --> 02:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
um just a clarification
 
02:15:13.010 --> 02:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the question
 
02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
Christmas I thought I heard you say
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
something that the um
 
02:15:20.870 --> 02:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
that the court ordered you to follow an
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
order but was that in violation of a
 
02:15:25.370 --> 02:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
restraining order I'm not I missed
 
02:15:27.770 --> 02:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
something somewhere yes
 
02:15:30.109 --> 02:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
um it was in violation of the protective
 
02:15:32.510 --> 02:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
orders they and they've actually held me
 
02:15:34.609 --> 02:15:34.619 align:start position:0%
in contempt there's an order of contempt
 
02:15:37.609 --> 02:15:37.619 align:start position:0%
for not filing and I filed multiple
 
02:15:40.490 --> 02:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
papers saying hey this is
 
02:15:43.069 --> 02:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
I can't do this so we're just a
 
02:15:45.410 --> 02:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
clarification certainly so were they
 
02:15:48.350 --> 02:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
asking you to use a a communication
 
02:15:50.089 --> 02:15:50.099 align:start position:0%
app to have direct communication with
 
02:15:52.129 --> 02:15:52.139 align:start position:0%
the protected party without changing the
 
02:15:56.089 --> 02:15:56.099 align:start position:0%
order and then I did send a motion
 
02:15:56.099 --> 02:15:57.589 align:start position:0%
order and then I did send a motion
objection

02:15:57.589 --> 02:15:57.599 align:start position:0%
objection
 
02:16:00.229 --> 02:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
and I have the index numbers too so I
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
have all the index numbers and so
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that clarification
 
02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Paul
 
02:16:11.930 --> 02:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:11.940 --> 02:16:13.550 align:start position:0%
 
no

02:16:13.550 --> 02:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:16:16.330 --> 02:16:16.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
okay no no
 
02:16:21.530 --> 02:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
um five minutes I have I actually have a
 
02:16:23.149 --> 02:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
book it's called incentives in the
 
02:16:26.089 --> 02:16:26.099 align:start position:0%
environment and basically the end and
 
02:16:27.410 --> 02:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
it's published and registered in the
 
02:16:29.629 --> 02:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
Library of Congress and um that can be
 
02:16:31.609 --> 02:16:31.619 align:start position:0%
given as testimony too and what I've
 
02:16:33.709 --> 02:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
determined is that people do what's in
 
02:16:36.650 --> 02:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
their perceived best interests so what
 
02:16:38.330 --> 02:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
I'd like to back up is that people are
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
doing what's in their perceived best
 
02:16:43.490 --> 02:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
interest by bullying people who have
 
02:16:45.709 --> 02:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
less resources which isn't a violation
 
02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
of 461a which was made in 2005
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
by this body and has sustained I don't
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
think that the laws per se need to be
 
02:16:59.570 --> 02:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
changed they're just not being followed
 
02:17:01.549 --> 02:17:01.559 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for that
 
02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
clarification I appreciate you taking
 
02:17:06.349 --> 02:17:06.359 align:start position:0%

rep recognizes

02:17:40.190 --> 02:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh members of the committee
 
02:17:42.530 --> 02:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not going to say this as well
 
02:17:44.750 --> 02:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
as Dave but he's not a very good public
 
02:17:48.169 --> 02:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
speaker so I'm back on May 9th in 2013
 
02:17:51.290 --> 02:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
Dave was actually a victim of a domestic
 
02:17:51.300 --> 02:17:52.669 align:start position:0%
Dave was actually a victim of a domestic
violence

02:17:52.669 --> 02:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
violence
 
02:17:54.349 --> 02:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
um he did have some of the judges that
 
02:17:56.810 --> 02:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
we've all experienced over here
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
um and he can obviously verify um if I
 
02:18:03.650 --> 02:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
misspeak here but he in his case
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
um he was brought in as a defense
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
on his domestic violence and the judge
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
actually was trying to find abuse where
 
02:18:12.770 --> 02:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
there was none
 
02:18:16.730 --> 02:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately as we all know that
 
02:18:20.509 --> 02:18:20.519 align:start position:0%
once you are classified as this painted
 
02:18:23.509 --> 02:18:23.519 align:start position:0%
picture you lose everything and
 
02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with Dave he
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
lost all of his property he lost his
 
02:18:32.810 --> 02:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
rights he lost all everything that he
 
02:18:37.549 --> 02:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
owned he he was in a situation that he
 
02:18:41.110 --> 02:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
had to sign over his property and
 
02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:43.009 align:start position:0%
had to sign over his property and
unfortunately

02:18:43.009 --> 02:18:43.019 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
um he he feels like his constitutional
 
02:18:46.990 --> 02:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
rights were lost at the very beginning
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
and as everybody can tell you that once
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
you're a domestic domestic violence
 
02:18:56.929 --> 02:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
victim whether you man a woman is one
 
02:18:59.089 --> 02:18:59.099 align:start position:0%
quick phone call and your rights your
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
everything that you've ever lived for is
 
02:19:03.889 --> 02:19:03.899 align:start position:0%
gone it's changed could you help me just
 
02:19:06.049 --> 02:19:06.059 align:start position:0%
clarify when you say
 
02:19:08.089 --> 02:19:08.099 align:start position:0%
a domestic
 
02:19:10.730 --> 02:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
abuse victim
 
02:19:15.589 --> 02:19:15.599 align:start position:0%
do you mean that he experienced abuse or
 
02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
that he is a victim in your perception
 
02:19:22.610 --> 02:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
or his position a victim of the system
 
02:19:25.849 --> 02:19:25.859 align:start position:0%
so if I may try to clarify that so I was
 
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
in a unique situation and I appreciate
 
02:19:31.610 --> 02:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
uh what representative ball said a few
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
weeks back
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
um there are guys who are victims of
 
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
domestic violence I was actually
 
02:19:38.810 --> 02:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
assaulted by my ex-wife who's larger
 
02:19:40.370 --> 02:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
than I am
 
02:19:45.950 --> 02:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and she was able to craft a uh and I
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
I did nothing I walked away I'm a man
 
02:19:50.750 --> 02:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to complain about it as
 
02:19:53.210 --> 02:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
many guys do so I walked away not
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
knowing that I was going to become the
 
02:19:56.090 --> 02:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
moving party in which the moving party
 
02:19:56.100 --> 02:19:57.349 align:start position:0%
moving party in which the moving party
pays

02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
pays
 
02:19:57.359 --> 02:19:58.929 align:start position:0%
pays
and

02:19:58.929 --> 02:19:58.939 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:02.770 --> 02:20:02.780 align:start position:0%
she was able to then file a 173 B
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
against me
 
02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:07.310 align:start position:0%
against me
um

02:20:07.310 --> 02:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:09.889 --> 02:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
which put me in in a complete defensive
 
02:20:11.690 --> 02:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
position I had a home-based business at
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
the time and these statutes essentially
 
02:20:16.849 --> 02:20:16.859 align:start position:0%
pulled me out of that away from the kids
 
02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
away from the business it shuttered my
 
02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
business completely and put me on the
 
02:20:25.790 --> 02:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
receiving end of of everything and not
 
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
even being able to
 
02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:28.849 align:start position:0%
even being able to
um

02:20:28.849 --> 02:20:28.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
go through a divorce I was in survival
 
02:20:33.410 --> 02:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
mode the entire time
 
02:20:35.690 --> 02:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
and when we had our first domestic
 
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
violence hearing
 
02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:39.050 align:start position:0%
violence hearing
uh

02:20:39.050 --> 02:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
my ex-wife uh couldn't come up with a
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
good story uh judging Picasso asked her
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know where's the abuse I need the
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
abuse and she expressed that she
 
02:20:51.469 --> 02:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
couldn't remember what Bridges had told
 
02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
her to say
 
02:20:55.730 --> 02:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
so then judge and decasso at the well
 
02:20:59.090 --> 02:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
after our allowed 30 minutes
 
02:20:59.100 --> 02:21:00.670 align:start position:0%
after our allowed 30 minutes
um

02:21:00.670 --> 02:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:03.230 --> 02:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
demanded that she have an example of
 
02:21:06.849 --> 02:21:06.859 align:start position:0%
abuse and they did a little sidebar and
 
02:21:09.230 --> 02:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
her attorney said that I sat on her
 
02:21:11.210 --> 02:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
eight months ago and and judgment
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
Picasso said well there it is
 
02:21:16.010 --> 02:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
and and that was it I was I was done it
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
was a good old school Mafia Shakedown
 
02:21:21.530 --> 02:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
from that point on thank you very much
 
02:21:24.530 --> 02:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
for that and you do speak quite clearly
 
02:21:26.690 --> 02:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
and well so I don't think you have to
 
02:21:31.610 --> 02:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
apologize to that and um could uh
 
02:21:34.730 --> 02:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the judge
 
02:21:38.809 --> 02:21:38.819 align:start position:0%
um is no longer on the bench and that he
 
02:21:44.090 --> 02:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
the judge was removed for um cause and
 
02:21:46.849 --> 02:21:46.859 align:start position:0%
that therefore at least in this
 
02:21:49.130 --> 02:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
particular case in the cases involving
 
02:21:51.550 --> 02:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
that judge
 
02:21:54.530 --> 02:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:21:57.170 --> 02:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
the system worked although it did not
 
02:22:00.349 --> 02:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily work to your person after I
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
had been steamrolled the system did work
 
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
however I have no uh remedy to recover
 
02:22:07.969 --> 02:22:07.979 align:start position:0%
anything that I lost
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and and it's it's just uh you know
 
02:22:12.770 --> 02:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
it's telling that when you go in as a
 
02:22:14.450 --> 02:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
pro se
 
02:22:16.849 --> 02:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
um you know I I know on on the orders at
 
02:22:19.070 --> 02:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom it gives you your notice of
 
02:22:22.010 --> 02:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
appellant Rights I would like to see a
 
02:22:24.590 --> 02:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
whole form or or two pages of a form
 
02:22:25.849 --> 02:22:25.859 align:start position:0%
which tells you all the other things I
 
02:22:27.530 --> 02:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
didn't know about JCC complaints I was
 
02:22:31.070 --> 02:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
one of so I'm from 2013. and I was I
 
02:22:33.170 --> 02:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
think I'm one of the earliest ones in
 
02:22:34.610 --> 02:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
our group to have complained against
 
02:22:36.889 --> 02:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
Julian dracasso uh and Marigold Master
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
Del pra who said I don't care how your
 
02:22:41.570 --> 02:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
kids live I had hearings where I was
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
brought in on EX parte's
 
02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
self-represented with her well-financed
 
02:22:48.889 --> 02:22:48.899 align:start position:0%
attorneys and I wasn't allowed to speak
 
02:22:50.990 --> 02:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
and the marital Masa Del Prado would
 
02:22:52.370 --> 02:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
drop his glasses to the end of his nose
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
and look at me
 
02:22:56.570 --> 02:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
and the entire hearing went without me
 
02:22:58.250 --> 02:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
saying a word thank you and what
 
02:23:00.889 --> 02:23:00.899 align:start position:0%

been removed as well thank you very much
I

02:23:06.429 --> 02:23:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:09.050 --> 02:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any
 
02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:12.170 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any
questions

02:23:12.170 --> 02:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:15.050 --> 02:23:15.060 align:start position:0%

02:23:31.150 --> 02:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
your suggestion that there ought to be
 
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
more detailed and clear discussion about
 
02:23:37.550 --> 02:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
the possibility for what happens next
 
02:23:42.050 --> 02:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
including uh appeal Alternatives is
 
02:23:43.610 --> 02:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
something that I think the committee
 
02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
would consider a very helpful suggestion
 
02:23:48.290 --> 02:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
so thank you for being here thank you

um that exhausts the pin cards that we
 
02:24:01.790 --> 02:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
have today is there anyone here who has
 
02:24:03.950 --> 02:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
not submitted a pink art who has not
 
02:24:06.410 --> 02:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
spoken but would like to speak to the
 
02:24:08.690 --> 02:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
committee now
 
02:24:08.700 --> 02:24:34.730 align:start position:0%
committee now
um

02:24:34.730 --> 02:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity my name is
 
02:24:38.290 --> 02:24:38.300 align:start position:0%
Gail drobat from Amherst New Hampshire
 
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
these are from where Amherst New
 
02:24:42.590 --> 02:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay
 
02:24:46.969 --> 02:24:46.979 align:start position:0%
um just a few of the laws 633 4 is
 
02:24:49.070 --> 02:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
interference with child custody
 
02:24:51.889 --> 02:24:51.899 align:start position:0%
and if you read that
 
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if any of you guys have
 
02:24:55.130 --> 02:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
read this before but
 
02:24:58.490 --> 02:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
it's a criminal code in every state
 
02:25:01.309 --> 02:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
when a parent goes
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
to get relief
 
02:25:06.170 --> 02:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
when a parent is interfering with child
 
02:25:08.270 --> 02:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
custody they're told to go back to
 
02:25:10.969 --> 02:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
family court it's a civil matter
 
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
it is a criminal code we need codes
 
02:25:16.849 --> 02:25:16.859 align:start position:0%
enforced in this state this would
 
02:25:19.730 --> 02:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
relieve the courts of being overburdened
 
02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
with these issues
 
02:25:24.590 --> 02:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
and it protects children it protects
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
children to have a right with both
 
02:25:27.889 --> 02:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
parents so
 
02:25:30.889 --> 02:25:30.899 align:start position:0%
that code needs to be enforced whether
 
02:25:34.250 --> 02:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
law enforcement needs retraining on that
 
02:25:37.730 --> 02:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the remedy is but
 
02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
we need to look into that if possible
 
02:25:43.849 --> 02:25:43.859 align:start position:0%
and the next page is Guardian ad litems
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
if you see 461 a16 regarding Garnier
 
02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.230 align:start position:0%
if you see 461 a16 regarding Garnier
enlightens

02:25:50.230 --> 02:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
enlightens
 
02:25:53.570 --> 02:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
2019 January 1st they changed the laws
 
02:25:56.030 --> 02:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
Guardian ad items are no longer to make
 
02:25:58.429 --> 02:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
recommendations to judges
 
02:26:02.510 --> 02:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
it shows bias and
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
we heard the guardian of the light and
 
02:26:06.410 --> 02:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
board speak a few weeks back and he said
 
02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
he kept repeating
 
02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
the Guardians make recommendations it's
 
02:26:14.270 --> 02:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
in the law if you go in you get court
 
02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:15.889 align:start position:0%
in the law if you go in you get court
orders

02:26:15.889 --> 02:26:15.899 align:start position:0%
orders
 
02:26:17.870 --> 02:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
they always say with the guardian's
 
02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations it's against New
 
02:26:23.570 --> 02:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law they cannot do that
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
so again we need enforcement of these
 
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
things we've had several parents testify
 
02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
about fees for Guardian Med items
 
02:26:35.150 --> 02:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
they're paying ten thousand dollars the
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
guardian of litems are allowed since
 
02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:39.410 align:start position:0%
guardian of litems are allowed since
2019

02:26:39.410 --> 02:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
2019
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
23 hours to do their investigation
 
02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
how are they making ten thousand dollars
 
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
in 23 hours
 
02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:51.950 align:start position:0%
in 23 hours
so

02:26:51.950 --> 02:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
if we can
 
02:26:56.690 --> 02:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
could you just give me the citation for
 
02:27:01.969 --> 02:27:01.979 align:start position:0%
that 23 hours yes it is 461 a
 
02:27:07.730 --> 02:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
six um 461 a 16 4 or 5.
 
02:27:11.690 --> 02:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:13.730 align:start position:0%
 
4B

02:27:13.730 --> 02:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
4B
 
02:27:16.070 --> 02:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
they have an hourly rate a maximum fee
 
02:27:17.210 --> 02:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
for the appointment that will be
 
02:27:21.770 --> 02:27:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
the hourly rate
 
02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
will be no more than twice the fund of a
 
02:27:28.610 --> 02:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
state funded case which we don't do
 
02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
anymore but I think that fee was ninety
 
02:27:34.429 --> 02:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
dollars the last time I heard so
 
02:27:34.439 --> 02:27:36.349 align:start position:0%
dollars the last time I heard so
um

02:27:36.349 --> 02:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:38.389 --> 02:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
unless the parties agree they can't go
 
02:27:41.389 --> 02:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
over 23 hours and then if you go down to
 
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
five It also says they can't exceed
 
02:27:46.570 --> 02:27:46.580 align:start position:0%
their fee cap
 
02:27:49.370 --> 02:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
or provide services without prior
 
02:27:52.309 --> 02:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
approval from the court after a hearing
 
02:27:55.490 --> 02:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
I noticed that um
 
02:27:58.730 --> 02:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
this printout does not come from the RSA
 
02:27:58.740 --> 02:28:00.170 align:start position:0%
this printout does not come from the RSA
or

02:28:00.170 --> 02:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:28:04.010 --> 02:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
um or the the supplement has this been
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
changed since the um
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
the state uh
 
02:28:16.969 --> 02:28:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:19.969 --> 02:28:19.979 align:start position:0%
I don't understand your question
 
02:28:22.849 --> 02:28:22.859 align:start position:0%
um representative Mitzi
 
02:28:26.990 --> 02:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
men clarify that statute has not been
 
02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:31.030 align:start position:0%
men clarify that statute has not been
changed

02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
changed
 
02:28:34.730 --> 02:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
the purpose was to show the state no
 
02:28:38.170 --> 02:28:38.180 align:start position:0%
longer fund tal the purpose was to limit
 
02:28:43.849 --> 02:28:43.859 align:start position:0%
J gal to the uh same extent that
 
02:28:47.270 --> 02:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
state-funded Gio if they existed would
 
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
be funded wait and that it could not it
 
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
could not go beyond that without
 
02:28:57.950 --> 02:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
agreement of parties and a confirmation
 
02:29:00.410 --> 02:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
by the judge and that if they did so
 
02:29:06.650 --> 02:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:08.410 --> 02:29:08.420 align:start position:0%
so this is the 2018
 
02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you very much for that
 
02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:13.550 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you very much for that
clarification

02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:15.770 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:29:15.770 --> 02:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:17.570 --> 02:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
in particular cases I know that's not
 
02:29:19.070 --> 02:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
happening they're exceeding their fees
 
02:29:22.969 --> 02:29:22.979 align:start position:0%
without hearings I know a specific and I
 
02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
will provide you the information for
 
02:29:26.929 --> 02:29:26.939 align:start position:0%
this I don't have it today but she was
 
02:29:29.450 --> 02:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
suspended and terminated and continued
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
to work in the party's had to pay so
 
02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
there needs to be oversight somewhere
 
02:29:36.730 --> 02:29:36.740 align:start position:0%
there was a complaint to the gal board
 
02:29:40.010 --> 02:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
