00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
position of assistant commissioner of
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%

and Foods I want to make this very clear
 
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
to all of you this morning this bill
 
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
does not fund the position of the
 
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner those funds were
 
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
already in the
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
budget due to an oversight on the part
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner no statutory
 
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
language for the process of actually
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
hiring the assistant was not submitted
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
for inclusion in House Bill 2 it wasn't
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
until the department attempted to post
 
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
the position that the oversight was
 
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
caught by human
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
resources this bill follows standard
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
procedures used by other agencies and
 
00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill was taken
 
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
directly from other current statutes and
 
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
finally Mr chairman uh this position is
 
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
in immediate need and the hope is that
 
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
it can be fast-tracked as so as to reach
 
00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 align:start position:0%
the governor's desk at the earliest
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
opportunity at this point I will
 
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony um the
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 align:start position:0%

this housekeeping
 
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
and now we'll we'll
 
00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
introduce someone known to us all
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner Shan Jasper Commissioner of
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
Agriculture morning commissioner good
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
committee and my first thing is to
 
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
apologize to you all for having to have
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
this here um I guess we all find out
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
that there are things that we should
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
know and don't know Senator Carson did a
 
00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
good job of explaining it um one good
 
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
thing has come out of this the form
 
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
79d has been changed to make sure that
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
there is now a notation relative to
 
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
statutory um language on it um because
 
00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:13.479 align:start position:0%
nobody caught it through the process I'd
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
never gone through this myself
 
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
um and you know while I could say
 
00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 align:start position:0%
somebody else should have caught it it
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
the buck uh stops here and so I am
 
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for for um the oversight but
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
I ask that you uh continue to fast track
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
this as you say as you see the Senate
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
has because we would like to to hire
 
00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of um things and a lot
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
of Grants going on right now and the he
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
consideration I'm glad to answer any
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%

hope once we get all these things off
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
the table and in time for the next
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
budget uh I do want to make you aware of
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
this this was a conversation I actually
 
00:08:58.509 --> 00:08:58.519 align:start position:0%
had with the governor during uh really
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
my first couple C of years in the
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
position but then Co threw everything
 
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
off and then as I became more aware of
 
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
everything there was to do uh it's got
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
pushed off to the side and I recently
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
did have a commissioner a conversation
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
with the Commissioner of Health and
 
00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:17.959 align:start position:0%
Human Services we are the Department of
 
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food yet we
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
don't have responsible responsibility
 
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
for all the um safety parts of food and
 
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:29.240 align:start position:0%
we should because we have fsma but that
 
00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:32.519 align:start position:0%
really ends at the packing of produce
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
and then HHS takes over after that um
 
00:09:39.389 --> 00:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
without changing their location or
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
anything I would really like to bring
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
all of food safety under the Department
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture markets and food and this
 
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
would be a project that this would this
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh assistant commissioner would work on
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
and probably ultimately be the person in
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
charge of overseeing that division
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
should that happen it's a project that
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
won't cost anything um they would stay
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
where they are there would be no moving
 
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:05.240 align:start position:0%
if this is all feasible and this is
 
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
where we have to look into the statutory
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
language but everybody I have spoken to
 
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
so far says yeah this makes a lot of
 
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
sense to have all of this under one
 
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
agency I've viewed this as within HHS
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
with no disrespect as probably a
 
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
there okay representative camell for a
 
00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner um will you be looking out
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
outside to fill this position or do you
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
think you may have qualified candidates
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
within the within the department so I do
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
have someone who I hope will will apply
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
of course this will be open internally
 
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
and we'll see who else comes out um to
 
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
apply for it but at the moment there is
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
somebody I think who is very well
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
qualified to take on this position and
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
has expressed an interest
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
members representative
 
00:11:11.069 --> 00:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
Earth thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
question why is it that an assistant
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner level position is required
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
rather than something like already in
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
the department as you just indicated you
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
have well technically you already have a
 
00:11:28.829 --> 00:11:28.839 align:start position:0%
deputy but that's the state veterinarian
 
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
um um and there's just it's relative to
 
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
line of authority now you know again
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
this is in the in the budget um in
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
talking about what the appropriate title
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
would be this seemed to be the
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate title given there's a deputy
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
who would remain a deputy um but there
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
is a with the six other divisions that
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
we have um and the thought of of per
 
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps bringing in the other I do think
 
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
it's a appropriate level um and did give
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of thought to to that but
 
00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what else to say on that
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
but thank you representative hle for a
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
question good morning thank you for
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
attending um part two of this bill talks
 
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
about the salary relative to 94 Das or
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
colon 1- a did they oh it is GG I was
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
looking for the salary level it's G G
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
you do you know what step it would
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
be um I don't and that would depend on
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
who applied I know we do have a budget
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
within that off the top of my head I
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
don't remember what it is um frankly if
 
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
the person who applies um who I think it
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
would be would just have to be careful
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there was at least a
 
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
slight increase in from what he that
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
individual is making as a director right
 
00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:18.920 align:start position:0%

at 10 o'clock to have a work session and
 
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
Talk Amongst ourselves if there's any
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
questions I believe all the questions
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
have been answered um we won't be voting
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
on this till 10:30 that's the that's
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
what the calendar says for the exec
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
session which has been posted the same
 
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
has been posted for the same day as the
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
U as the hearing so we've got an
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
extensive calendar to look through we've
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
got some new bills that are coming our
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
way um one of them that's on the table
 
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
is 1570 I believe there's three or four
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
others that may be in the other room I
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
haven't found out yet what the illness
 
00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
is that's keeping Janet out but she's
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
been out most of the last week as well
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
let's try to find out and send her a get
 
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
well cardred it's hard it you can see
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
the difference in not working when she's
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
here and uh not everything gets
 
00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:39.759 align:start position:0%
distributed as evenly as we'd like but
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
Karen karaki is filling in and she's got
 
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
three other committees I think she also
 
00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:46.839 align:start position:0%
has to run around that's why she left us
 
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
her cell phone if there was any
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
immediate need but I would hope you'd
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
all thank her for filling in and uh
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
we'll try to find out what what's
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
holding up Janet and send her get well
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
card so see you all back here at 10:00
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
much good chance to
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.600 --> 00:34:04.990 align:start position:0%
 
7

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
I mean I mean that I mean that's what
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
rich people do okay we'll call our 10
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
o'clock work session on House Bill 395
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
and whatever else we want to discuss one
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that we have 1570 on the
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
desk before us is I'm looking I'm
 
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the scheduling that was done
 
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:26.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps by someone other than Janet and
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
it like they had scheduled 1560 again
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
which has already been tabled there's no
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
need for us to have any hearings on it
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
and I think what what it was supposed to
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
be was
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
1570 70 but we also show a schedule for
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
1579 which looks to read like the same
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
bill so there's some mistakes here we've
 
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
got to work on we don't have the
 
00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:52.839 align:start position:0%
perfectionist Janet yet back so those
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
are the things we wanted to discuss is
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
there any um discussion amongst us on
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
it I Mr chair I I I missed um the
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
discussion but I had talked to Senator
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
Carson before the hearing yep and um as
 
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
a just as a matter of how we do Manpower
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
I don't like the way this is getting
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
done I I've not I've not seen a Manpower
 
00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:29.079 align:start position:0%
analysis to justify it I guess
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper talked about that uh
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
while I was not here um but I I I really
 
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
am not comfortable adding expensive um
 
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
very senior people to the state
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
government well without a clear
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
justification he will uh he'll be back
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
again and we can hopefully have that
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
discussion when he comes the uh
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
the the information I received seemed to
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
be that this had been discussed at the
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
governor's level than it had been
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
discussed at the budget level and I
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
think Dan doesn't remember that that
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
much in going of Peter it was it was
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
discussed yeah thank you Mr chairman it
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
was discussed and accepted in our
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
division at the time so so I had asked
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire before the
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
meeting if he recalled it and he didn't
 
00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
if representative leean recalls it being
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
discussed in division one and and
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
approved then I'll withdraw my concern
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other opposition that
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
we ought to discuss with the
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner yeah I don't I don't
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
remember but but as I I I asked Mike
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
Hoffman and he says basically this is a
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
mess up of the way House Bill 2 was
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
drafted right that that you can add a
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
class an unclassified position without
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill too but you can't add a
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
classified I'm sorry the other way
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
around you can add a classified position
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
without House Bill too but an
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
unclassified position like this you need
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
both right and it and it got the house
 
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
bill one part it didn't get the house
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
bill two part so
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
okay any other concerns among the
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
members um if everybody's ready we'll
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
vote at at 10:30 and and perhaps the
 
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner will be back prior to that
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
and we can have any discussion with him
 
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
uh if anybody has has any concerns about
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
passing this obviously they they feel on
 
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate side and and uh and if we we
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
did anything else with this we'd have to
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
go back to a committee of conference if
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
we did anything other than just pass it
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
clean and I don't know as we're ready to
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
do a committee of conference it came out
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
of the Senate I think unanimous and I
 
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the record though but I'm
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
assuming that from what Senator Carson
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
said Mr chairman
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
yeses just to smooth things over a
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
little bit here uh what we need to bear
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
in mind is that there are two factors
 
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
involved in these things one is money
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
and one is Authority yes and what
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
happened was somehow or rather the thing
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
got got messed around and they created
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh they created the money in the in the
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation but they forgot to give
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
the person for who was getting paid the
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
money the authority to perform the
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
duties that were previously performed by
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
somebody else who changed title to
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
become a
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
veterinarian yes so that's so basically
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
this is providing the authority not the
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
money the money is already within that
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
budget and the position is
 
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.630 align:start position:0%
budget and the position is
funded

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.109 --> 00:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
so we have more time to discuss it if
 
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
you wish all right Mr chair i h having
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
having spent the a a year of my life in
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
Korea doing Manpower analysis I
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
understand the difference between faces
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
and spaces and the spaces are the
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
authorizations and the authorization
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
separate from the money and all I get
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
that but the other thing that happens
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
with a a Manpower request is there's
 
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
usually some kind of a workload
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
justification to back up the fact that
 
00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
it's needed it's it's one thing to
 
00:39:24.309 --> 00:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
authorize it it's the other thing to
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
authorize it in an intelligent
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
cost beneficial discipline kind of way
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
and that's the part I was missing but
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
based on represent of Lehman's
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
representation I'm I'm I'm comfortable
 
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
that they reviewed the the adequacy of
 
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.069 align:start position:0%
that they reviewed the the adequacy of
the

00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
authorization were you here for any of
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh the commissioner's
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
discussion uh no sir I was not I had
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
talked to Carson beforehand let me tell
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
you what I heard from him and if any if
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
I miss any of the other presentation
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
please fill in he's got a lot of
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
projects he's got a lot of
 
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
Grants he's of course he's the
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Agriculture markets and
 
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
food and he felt that the food he had
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
not been able to adequately address
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
within his Department he thinks HHS
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
looks at a portion of it but he thinks
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
it's not really any priority in in HHS
 
00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
which has made me health
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
and and not that portion of the health
 
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
as looking at the food maybe it's about
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
talking about nutrition but not so much
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the
 
00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:39.079 align:start position:0%
food um chain of command or what or food
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
safety food
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
safety uh he didn't think that that was
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
probably emphasized as much in that
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
department as he would like to um seeing
 
00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:51.079 align:start position:0%
it's a major portion it's the only place
 
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
really in the in the state government
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
where it talks about somebody being
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for food so we thinks he
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
know needs to expand that and take over
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
that and perhaps have HHS find out what
 
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
little they do and say you don't need to
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
do it anymore so that that was one of
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
the things he wanted to look at yeah yes
 
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:11.240 align:start position:0%
and he he also said that he'd had
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
somebody internally that he hopes will
 
00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
apply for the job uh uh thank you Mr
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
chair all of that sounds um like it's
 
00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
heading in the right direction so so I I
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
I put in a call this morning to the
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner of DHA HS to find out what
 
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
her situational awareness was on the
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
transfer of responsibilities because
 
00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
even something like that ought to be
 
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
done in a formal agreed upon Manner and
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
if responsibilities are being shifted
 
00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
out of DHHS then that opens up the
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
question should any man money or
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
Manpower transfer with it and so so
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
there's an entire Manpower analysis
 
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
packet here that my obsessive compulsive
 
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
nature wants to see and feel and
 
00:41:58.589 --> 00:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
question that just doesn't exist right
 
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
if if if if we didn't have to do this
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
vote today if we could reschedule the
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
vote I I would like to look at that but
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer to you and the
 
00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
committee on that yeah I I think in in
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
many cases the going to a uh
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
unclassified position from somebody
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
that's already in a classified position
 
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
is probably not a lot of money but it
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
depends on the position they're in now
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what we didn't really get
 
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
into that discussion but I don't think
 
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
this would be a tremendous amount of
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
money if it's a a promotion from within
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
and and then perhaps looking for
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
somebody else to fill in and that other
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
position maybe at an entry level so we
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
may not be spending a lot of money and
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
and obviously there's already money
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
within the budget that was put in there
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
and it's been reviewed so
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
Peter uh thanks Mr chairman yes I'm glad
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
my memory hasn't failed me yet but
 
00:42:59.470 --> 00:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
uh we did discuss this the assistant
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner position and with Benefits
 
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:08.559 align:start position:0%
um technology travel and so forth um was
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
$123,000 for fiscal
 
00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:13.079 align:start position:0%
24 and
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
131,000 for fiscal 25 that did not
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
include the pay raise of 10 and two oh
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
so those those are the numbers we
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
discussed back during the budget process
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you y appreciate
 
00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:29.079 align:start position:0%
filling that in that
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.349 --> 00:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
discussion Dan since we have
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
time sort of on a separate
 
00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:46.359 align:start position:0%
topic do we have any um data on sort of
 
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
the overall state of um what we have to
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
spend and what's coming to us uh that
 
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
you know as
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
requests um
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
um because I'm wondering the last
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
numbers I heard were were that you know
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
SP require requested spending is here
 
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
and our resources are down here and it's
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
like 10 to one so I'm wondering if do we
 
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
know the more current state of perhaps
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
Mike can fill us in what I know the LBA
 
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
is paying attention to
 
00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:23.079 align:start position:0%
this yes M Mike Kane is working on a
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
complete list of all bills with
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation both in the Senate and the
 
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
house and he should have that very soon
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
um and it's a little bit of a a moving
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
picture as you know the weeks go by and
 
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
things are changed on the floor but he
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
would he would have that he could also
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
provide maybe a snap snapshot of the
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
general and education uh trust fund
 
00:44:48.599 --> 00:44:50.470 align:start position:0%
general and education uh trust fund
status

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
as as of close to now yep and I I did
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
get a note from somebody I think it was
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
1666 had gone through a committee and
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
they had removed the
 
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
money and with an amendment but it still
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
has an FN so we'll have to watch for
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
those and see what happens on the list I
 
00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
saw on the wall now there's about 14
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
including this one uh and including 1560
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
and I probably said earlier that the
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
reason why we have this bill before us
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
1570 is because there was some confusion
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
on the wall they still showed 1560 as
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
coming before us and having to to be a
 
00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
hearing again we don't need to do that
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
because it's already been tabled and
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
heard uh but 1579 was listed but it
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
appears to be the the substance of
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
15 1570 rather so there were some
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
problems I've got to um work out in the
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
absence of Janet I'll be working on
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
those today another thing that um I was
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
discussing with representative Emer on
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
scheduling they discouraged scheduling
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
for the following week we won't have a
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
session we've been told that it's looked
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
at as education or I mean as the school
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
education vacation I'm told that some of
 
00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
the division one people are going to be
 
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
out anyway during that week and perhaps
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
some of the rest of you are so I I will
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
not schedule anything for that week but
 
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
the next week into March we'll probably
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
be busy with the bills that we
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
have and and be hearing them at the
 
00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559 align:start position:0%
likely at the division levels first and
 
00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
then come together for a uh an exec
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
session once the divisions have done all
 
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
their work on those bills so that's what
 
00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
you'll be looking for a busy week the
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
first week in March nothing else this
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
week and probably nothing we do have a
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
session on Thursday but um and we'll
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
find out if there a lot of those bills
 
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
survive we'll probably get a few more
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
added to our list and then we'll be busy
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
in in March so um you're right that some
 
00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
bills the the spending has been stripped
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
out but then there's others where
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
spending has been added we already have
 
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of bail bills that want to add
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
15 full
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
magistrates so those are like
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
$150,000 a pop positions you know so
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
there there's stuff going both ways on
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
these amendments you know all right so
 
00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
uh I know that the LBA is is paying good
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
attention of that send me updates as
 
00:47:46.109 --> 00:47:46.119 align:start position:0%
they review them and hopefully some of
 
00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:49.559 align:start position:0%
these will have fiscal notes to the
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
dollar when we finally meet on them so
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
it's all a matter of if the Departments
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
cooperate but I know the LBA is right on
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
top of it and trying to keep us all
 
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
informed so that's that's what we know
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
so far so uh I I don't plan anything if
 
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
if you've already thought ahead to the
 
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
vacation week and going somewhere I I
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to interfere with that and we
 
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
won't have a session either so um after
 
00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
March yes uh division 3 addendum on that
 
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
that's consistent with what you just
 
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
said uh right now division 3's uh had
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
two bills assigned to them one of them
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
looks like it's a mistake that we're
 
00:48:39.069 --> 00:48:39.079 align:start position:0%
going to get checked because it's about
 
00:48:41.309 --> 00:48:41.319 align:start position:0%
special education and Court jurisdiction
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't feel like our jurisdiction
 
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
so we only have one we are not going to
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
meet during the vacation week that we'll
 
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
we'll knock out the one the week
 
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
after and I don't have a schedule yet
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
for going to um um Glenn Brier and um I
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
also asked for us to go over to um um
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
the the the god Hamstead I'm having a
 
00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.109 align:start position:0%
the the the god Hamstead I'm having a
senior

00:49:10.109 --> 00:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
senior
 
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
moment inclen Cliff thank you so much I
 
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
will I will never criticize anyone for
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
again okay so we've tentatively
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled division 2 for Tuesday the 5th
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
probably about 10:30 because it's also a
 
00:49:35.789 --> 00:49:35.799 align:start position:0%
day we meet with chairs and vice chairs
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
in the 9:15 to 10:30 slot division one
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
probably will meet on 10:00 on Wednesday
 
00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
the 6th
 
00:49:47.069 --> 00:49:47.079 align:start position:0%
tentatively and uh division three
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
whenever you maybe you'll see more bills
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
this calendar and feel like fitting
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
something in but if you've only got that
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
one it's just the one now yeah so we'll
 
00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:00.799 align:start position:0%
see what happens uh this Thursday and
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll talk again on that but
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's some of the tenative stuff
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
so far um we got a few more minutes
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
anything else we want to discuss and
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
vote nothing more to discuss all right
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
another 10-minute break and and we'll be
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
back working on just
 
00:50:27.359 --> 00:50:54.430 align:start position:0%
back working on just
thank

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.440 --> 01:00:22.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%
all right I think if we get in our seats
 
01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.349 --> 01:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
session and you'll have one more chance
 
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:34.599 align:start position:0%
before we exact to ask the commissioner
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
any and I think it's just representative
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
Edwards that wishes to ask of the
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner some
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
question may may I commissioner
 
01:00:48.319 --> 01:00:49.870 align:start position:0%
question may may I commissioner
Jasper

01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
Jasper
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
so so because I was an old army Manpower
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
officer I get some OB exessive about
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
some of this and I'm sorry I didn't hear
 
01:00:59.309 --> 01:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
your earlier testimony but one of the
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
things that was re relayed to me is that
 
01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that
 
01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
DHHS has some responsibilities in the
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
food safety area and those
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh are pro more
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
properly uh in your jurisdiction and
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
would be transferred and so that just
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
that just opens the question in my mind
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
has has this potential transfer of
 
01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities been socialized with
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
the anyone in
 
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS and do you happen to know if it's
 
01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
going to have any impact on their
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
Manpower or
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
money thank you for the question so yes
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
I I have had a conversation I'll be it
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
brief with the commissioner um and she
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
is certainly amenable to um having
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
further conversations about it um that
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
is not the primary reason for this this
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
is one of the things um that I think is
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
important the reality is that without an
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner um it's been very
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
difficult for me to get into many of the
 
01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
things that I that I should and I will
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
tell you that in now I'm in my seventh
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
year as commissioner um I have never
 
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
taken more than three personal days off
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
in a row and take very few of those uh
 
01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
it's just really important uh for me to
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
to be here um there have been some trips
 
01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
I was in DC for policy meeting um for 4
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
days with travel um and I it will take
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
me weeks to catch up on what I got
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
behind on in those four days of being
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
out of the office uh and I don't think
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's fair to any commissioner to have
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
to really not be able to say hey I'm
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
going to take my wife and go on vacation
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
for two years that's not even I for two
 
01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
years excuse me for two weeks that's not
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
even an option for me to say I'm going
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
to be gone for uh for two weeks there's
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
just nobody there to to deal with that
 
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
and we have we are when I first came in
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner Merill said the
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
department is in triage mode and the
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
department was I think I've gotten us
 
01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
out of triage but there is not a lack of
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
work for anyone to do so there isn't the
 
01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
ability for me to turn turn anything
 
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
over to anybody even in a short term
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
right now thank
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
you okay I guess we got two more
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative camell thank you Mr chair
 
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr commissioner so along those
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
lines um how well staffed is the
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
department or what percentage of your
 
01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
positions you have filled or how many
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
openings you have
 
01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:52.039 align:start position:0%
currently I think we
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
are fully staffed all although there
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
might be one that is in the adver
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
advertising and when I came in we had 32
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
32 filled full-time positions with six
 
01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
vacancies and we've stayed pretty much
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
in the last two years pretty near full
 
01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.710 align:start position:0%
in the last two years pretty near full
Staffing

01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
Staffing
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative papichi
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
Muller thank you Mr chair my question is
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
not just for the commissioner but for
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
everybody else I don't I think I
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
understand that we already discussed
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
this position and we put the numbers in
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
hb1 but you know the legal language was
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
not inserted in hb2 did that happen the
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
in the original budget that left the
 
01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
finance committee or was it something
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
that was added uh during the you know
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
floor or the Senate phases um thank you
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
for the question no this was in our
 
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
budget request it was approved by the by
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
the governor and it did go through the
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
whole process and just
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
everybody over overlooked it um you know
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
that's just the reality so the only
 
01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
reason we are here is not really to do I
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
need the position or not what's what
 
01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
should the language be which should have
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
been house too yeah when he said it was
 
01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
overlooked it doesn't mean the position
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
he meant the the assignment of the
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
language to put someone in the position
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
my question is this is part of what we
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
voted on as a house finance committee
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
all right any further discussion seeing
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
