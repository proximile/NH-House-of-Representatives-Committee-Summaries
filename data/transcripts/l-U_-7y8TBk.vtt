I pledge allegiance to the pledge of the
 
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759 align:start position:0%
justice for all
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
nine bills that are on that we retained
 
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
during the uh
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
during the course of the uh of the
 
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.809 align:start position:0%
during the course of the uh of the
session

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:43.819 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:46.139 align:start position:0%
and what I'd like to do is I want to
 
00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:48.419 align:start position:0%
make this a relatively informal uh
 
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
meeting what I'd like to do is is get is
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
solicit information from the committee
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
as to uh what bills people have some
 
00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
interest in working on
 
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
um and and maybe to try to see if
 
00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:07.139 align:start position:0%
if it appears that
 
00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:07.730 align:start position:0%
if it appears that
um

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
you know there's a basis for us for us
 
00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
sort of having a different view of the
 
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
bills than we had originally or that
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
there's some basis for people coming
 
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:18.539 align:start position:0%
together to on various types of
 
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
compromises if that's possible and I
 
00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
hope I hope it is
 
00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:22.790 align:start position:0%
hope I hope it is
um

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
so what I'd like to do first
 
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
is take
 
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.730 align:start position:0%
is take
um

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
two bills that I think are they have
 
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
they have they're different in in what
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
the what they cover but they have
 
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
um they are related in the sense that
 
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
they both deal with privacy issues
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
and that is SB 255
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
and SB and house bill 314.
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
um and what I'm what I'm I'm throwing
 
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
this out for everyone's consideration
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking is if we have people
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
that are interested in working on those
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
and I and I would include myself as one
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
who is working who is interested
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
if we would if there would be a way
 
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
that we might combine those bills
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
um to you know to have a more
 
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
comprehensive because 255 is basically
 
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
um deals with uh imposing uh privacy
 
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.530 align:start position:0%
um deals with uh imposing uh privacy
rights

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:26.540 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
establishing privacy rights for
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
individuals related to information that
 
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
is that is in the possession of for lack
 
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
of a better term sort of larger
 
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.670 align:start position:0%
of a better term sort of larger
businesses

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
314 is dealing with providing
 
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
privacy rights for information that may
 
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
originate in the private sector but ends
 
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
up in the hands of government and it's
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
the Privacy versus the government
 
00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:55.019 align:start position:0%
um so maybe
 
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
um it would be possible to uh
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
to combine those in some way
 
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.449 align:start position:0%
and so
um

00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
I I would be interested in working on
 
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
that and I representative Devine also
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
are there other people that have some
 
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
interest in
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry oh wait a minute so all right
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.009 --> 00:10:30.019 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm sorry so um we have
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
Lynn Divine Smith tur who else
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
I think so yeah I think that I think
 
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.110 align:start position:0%
I think so yeah I think that I think
they

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.829 align:start position:0%
they
um

00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
all right other uh Joe Alexander okay
 
00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:53.459 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:10:53.459 --> 00:10:56.509 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.210 --> 00:10:59.220 align:start position:0%
sure let me start so it's Lynn Divine
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
so um and I'm going to ask I'm gonna
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
call on the ranking member to correct me
 
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
if I if I've uh if I misstate anything
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
here but as I understand it
 
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
um if we if we have a subcommittee
 
00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:22.019 align:start position:0%
um we need to we need to give notice
 
00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:23.579 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have a if when we're
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
going to have a uh a meeting
 
00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:29.339 align:start position:0%
um and we can't do it in July and August
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to do anything we have
 
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
to do it we have to do something
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
in June if there's to the extent that we
 
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
have time to do that and then more
 
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:38.990 align:start position:0%
have time to do that and then more
likely

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
likely
 
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
um in uh in September
 
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
um the other the other question I have
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
because I'd like to do this if I can uh
 
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.930 align:start position:0%
because I'd like to do this if I can uh
uh

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:46.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
representative Smith is can we appoint
 
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
somebody that's not a member of this
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
committee to work on it um another rep I
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
um no my understanding is that this is
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
these are bills that are before this
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
committee and this is a sub we would be
 
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:06.140 align:start position:0%
forming a subcommittee of this committee
 
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
we of course can invite anyone we choose
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
other members or people from the public
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
to come and participate in the
 
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work sessions okay of
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
course they can't vote but um they can
 
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
participate I would suggest that you
 
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
might want to appoint a chair of the
 
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee no I I agree whenever you
 
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
want yeah no no that's a great idea so
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to say is I I know
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative Earth has a great
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
interest in this area and I I think he
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
would be a you know uh he's here now and
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
he would have a great deal of of
 
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
valuable input to make so even if he
 
00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:49.019 align:start position:0%
can't sort of formally be a member of
 
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee I think we want to make
 
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
sure that he is you know is notified of
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
the meeting so he can come and that that
 
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
kind of thing I think you would have
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
important input
 
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.110 align:start position:0%
um so
um

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:05.459 align:start position:0%
does somebody want to volunteer to be
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
the chair of the subcommittee I'm more
 
00:13:08.569 --> 00:13:08.579 align:start position:0%
than happy to do it but if somebody
 
00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
wants to volunteer like representative
 
00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:14.459 align:start position:0%
Smith I'd be happy to appoint you as the
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:22.190 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
anything else people want to talk about
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
on the um with regard to those two bills
 
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.329 align:start position:0%
on the um with regard to those two bills
did

00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:32.339 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
um the the only thing I would say on
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
this and obviously we we you know will
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
have more much more detailed discussion
 
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.210 align:start position:0%
on this
um

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.590 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.870 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
one thing that I notice as a substantial
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
difference between 255 and 314 which
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
you know I
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
whether we can bridge this Gap or not I
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know but it would be
 
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
interesting to I mean it would certainly
 
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
be worth a try is one of the big things
 
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.850 align:start position:0%
be worth a try is one of the big things
that

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
um I think was was an issue in in in 255
 
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
being retained is there are some people
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
that believe it it does not call call
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
for a private cause of action right now
 
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
and some people believed it should
 
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
um I was one of those personally that
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
that feel pretty strongly there should
 
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
not be a private right of action but
 
00:14:26.579 --> 00:14:27.530 align:start position:0%
not be a private right of action but
um

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
that's neither here nor there for now
 
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
but the the important thing I was going
 
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
to say is 314 does call for some kind of
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
a private right of action
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
um as I recall and so that you know if
 
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
there if we're going to combine this
 
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
that that is something that um is going
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to work that out how
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
how we deal with that uh and I don't
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
know whether it can be worked out but
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's these are important
 
00:14:56.329 --> 00:14:56.339 align:start position:0%
enough things that um
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
we should uh
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
we should try
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else yes
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I also want to make sure that
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
everyone on the committee knows that
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
um although they haven't been named to
 
00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:14.540 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee they are all
 
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
welcome to show up and participate in
 
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
the work sessions and they will be work
 
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
sessions rather than hearings
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh but then at some point the
 
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would vote and bring that
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee no
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
that's that sounds fine
 
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
um and you know what what just one other
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
thing I um I I thought I specifically
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
asked the clerk about this while we
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
cannot have while these subcommittees
 
00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
cannot have any meetings
 
00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
um in in July or August if somebody you
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
know if there's a if somebody thinks
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
that wants to take a stab at putting
 
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
together a draft of some of some
 
00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
proposed way that we might that these
 
00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:05.459 align:start position:0%
might that and you when you're working
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
on your own that's fine you can do that
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
on your own it's just we can't we can't
 
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
have a discussion about that the
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can't have a discussion or
 
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
a meeting about that until until uh
 
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
September but there's nothing to prevent
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
you know people if you have some time
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
over the summer you want to put pen to
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
paper uh that's great
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
um all right anything else on 255 or
 
00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:28.490 align:start position:0%
um all right anything else on 255 or
314.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
314.
 
00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:31.019 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
00:16:31.019 --> 00:16:32.930 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
um

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
the next bill I'd like to turn to is HB
 
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.749 align:start position:0%
the next bill I'd like to turn to is HB
149

00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
149
 
00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:40.430 align:start position:0%
149
um

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that requires agencies to
 
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
provide periodic updates of when records
 
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
will uh if uh if a municipality or
 
00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:52.259 align:start position:0%
someone else some other agency subject
 
00:16:53.769 --> 00:16:53.779 align:start position:0%
to the right to no law
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
is unable to provide uh a response to a
 
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
request within the usual time which I
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
think is five days then they're required
 
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
updates of when the records will be
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
provided and
 
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
I gotta to be honest with you I think I
 
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
have to say I'm having a senior moment
 
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
here because I'm not quite sure I
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
remember exactly why what the issue was
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
that we retained it but we did and so
 
00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:22.610 align:start position:0%
that we retained it but we did and so
um

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
people have an interest in working on
 
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
this and uh
 
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.810 align:start position:0%
this and uh
sure

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
so when we talked about this bill the
 
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman was just starting up it's my
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
understanding I'm wondering if they had
 
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.090 align:start position:0%
understanding I'm wondering if they had
any

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here from uh that knows
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
anything about in the audience I mean
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
that knows anything about them
 
00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I think that
 
00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
we retained it because we were waiting
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
on kind of maybe a report to see if this
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
bill is even necessary with the with the
 
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman just like like okay okay
 
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:08.990 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman just like like okay okay
um

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
I think it might be wise to reach out
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
and see kind of get a report from the
 
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman and see how many of these
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
cases that they've settled or
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
um adjudicated I guess is the word
 
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.470 align:start position:0%
um adjudicated I guess is the word
um

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
regarding like the timeline on right to
 
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
know requests and making sure that if if
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
this isn't being dealt with by the
 
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman that we deal with it with this
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
film all right
 
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
um so yes representation and again goes
 
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
this is the first time this committee
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
has handled uh the retained bills I also
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
want to point out that
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
um uh we are um
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
at least at the moment still in a
 
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
society where we're free to decide
 
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
things for ourselves that might change
 
00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
but right now that's what it is and uh
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
it might be that no one on the committee
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
wants to invest extra time on any of
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
these bills in that case what would
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
happen is we would not be forming a
 
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.409 align:start position:0%
happen is we would not be forming a
subcommittee

00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:12.419 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
since no one should be compelled to
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
serve on the subcommittee but when the
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
full committee gets together later you
 
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
know probably in October
 
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
um then the full committee would would
 
00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:28.340 align:start position:0%
discuss uh
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
those bills since since there wouldn't
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
be a subcommittee coming in to make a
 
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
recommendation so I just want to point
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
that out as I did not see people
 
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.220 align:start position:0%
jumping up to volunteer right right so
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
you know I wonder if it to sort of um
 
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
follow up on what both you uh and
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander said would it
 
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
make sense to just say
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
um we're not going to do anything on
 
00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:54.059 align:start position:0%
this one until October and in the
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
meantime I'll reach out to the Ombudsman
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
and find out how how things have sort of
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
gone and if there's if there's if we
 
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
need to take some further action we can
 
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
you know we can do it in October Mr
 
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
chair yes
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative trip
 
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
uh since since we are combining 255 and
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
314 together into one subcommittee I was
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
wondering uh since we have we have
 
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
another bill no set of bills that deal
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
with right to know and that would be 149
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
the one that we're discussing right now
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
and uh 652.
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
you know uh if we're going to you know
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
use the logic that uh like bills could
 
00:20:41.049 --> 00:20:41.059 align:start position:0%
be you know looked at at the same time
 
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
uh I I would suggest we combine these
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
two bills together and have the
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee look at them you know
 
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.330 align:start position:0%
subcommittee look at them you know
jointly

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
jointly
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to serve on that
 
00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
committee okay
 
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
um what are people think I I you know I
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
I mean I I'm wondering if these two I
 
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
they it's true that they both deal with
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
the right to know law but they're oh
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
they are different they are you know I
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
think different in a way that maybe 255
 
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
and 314 are not and so I'm just
 
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
wondering if the
 
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
um if that what do people think about
 
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
combining it is it yes thank you Mr
 
00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:19.820 align:start position:0%
chair I think that um
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
149 is not germane to the other two
 
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
bills 314 and 255. so it doesn't sound
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
like a good idea I think the scope of
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
the two privacy bills HB 314 and SB 255
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
are very very
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:45.539 align:start position:0%
I think it would be difficult so it'll
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
Jam everything together in a soup yeah
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know representative De Lorenzo
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
unless I I may have misunderstood a
 
00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp but I think he was
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
suggesting a committee that would
 
00:21:59.450 --> 00:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
combine HB 149 with HB 652 which we
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
haven't yet discussed
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
so um but but I guess even I even there
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that those are kind of
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
close enough that it would make sense
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
but what what do people think
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative they're both
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
um they both um title HP 652 is uh
 
00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
mildly well not really misleading but
 
00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:24.419 align:start position:0%
91a is basically the right to know and
 
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
open meetings law so HP 652 deals with
 
00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:30.659 align:start position:0%
more of an open meetings issue than a
 
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
right to know or you know document
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
retrieval issues so that's a little bit
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
different I mean it's not a terrible
 
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
idea having the same subcommittee deal
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
with both of them but it's even though
 
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
it's the same RSA it's two fairly
 
00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:45.299 align:start position:0%
different functions of the same RSA so
 
00:22:48.649 --> 00:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
they are something that is
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
on now that is perhaps not being
 
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
followed you know it's a five day thing
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
now and it's not being followed whereas
 
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
I perceive
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
sick perhaps not being found 652 as a
 
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
whole new entity so I think they're too
 
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
far apart I think I truly feel that if
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
we find from the Ombudsman that this is
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
not an issue uh the 149
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps we don't need it or do we need
 
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
to be preventative in having it so that
 
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
it doesn't I know it does happen but I
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if it happens enough to reach
 
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
people going to the odd budget so
 
00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:36.299 align:start position:0%
I think they're two different and
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative Smith this was your bill
 
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:43.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
right and I just wondered how strongly
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
you feel about 149 do you feel it can be
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
solved with finding out what the
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
so I may your response
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
um I think the suggestion that we wait a
 
00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:00.049 align:start position:0%
um I think the suggestion that we wait a
bit

00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:00.059 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059 align:start position:0%
um makes a lot of sense and I don't
 
00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:06.419 align:start position:0%
notice that representative De Lorenzo is
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
objecting to that we always
 
00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:12.299 align:start position:0%
um can decide subsequently that we do
 
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
want to have a subcommittee
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
um and we can do that in September or
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
October right so you know what what
 
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
maybe what if we do this
 
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
um why don't we
 
00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.289 align:start position:0%
um why don't we
um

00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
my inclination is that 652 may be
 
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
something that people have some interest
 
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
in working on I I frankly would would
 
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
have some interest in that but why don't
 
00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:36.299 align:start position:0%
we why don't we do this when we get to
 
00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
652 if we if we appoint a subcommittee
 
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
that subcommittee can work and then uh I
 
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
will make the inquiries of the Ombudsman
 
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh and then in October if if you know if
 
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:50.220 align:start position:0%
it decides that we if we decide that we
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
need to do something on uh 149 either
 
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
the whole this whole committee uh can do
 
00:24:59.930 --> 00:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
that or we might we might then task that
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
the 652 subcommittee with dealing with
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
this also or form another or form
 
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
another Circle yeah one of the so that
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
makes sense to everybody
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
all right all right
 
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
um and since we started to talk about
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
652 why don't I turn to that one next
 
00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:18.110 align:start position:0%
652 why don't I turn to that one next
um

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
and I guess
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
I'd start out by saying my inclination
 
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
on 652 I think I may have mentioned this
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
to uh representative Smith was when I um
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
when this first came up I uh really was
 
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
my inclination was that it we didn't
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
really This was
 
00:25:39.649 --> 00:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
um you know a solution in search of a
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
problem and that really that we didn't
 
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
really need to do anything but as I
 
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
heard more at the hearing
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I my my view changed on
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
that that um
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
that maybe there really is something
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
that we need to deal with here and I
 
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
note that um there was a supreme New
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court decision that
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
was referenced during the hearing and I
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
I haven't read it recently but I did
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
really read it right after the hearing
 
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
and there was a
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
a pretty strong separate opinion by
 
00:26:12.649 --> 00:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
Justice Hans Marconi
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
um which sort of said
 
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
you know though even though I mean her
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
view was even the law as it is now there
 
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
she would have interpreted to say that
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
there needed to be some kind of notice
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
or something like that so
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
um uh that kind of reinforced my view
 
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
that maybe there is something that that
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
could be worked on here and so I would
 
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
be willing to work on a subcommittee if
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
other people did anybody else have an
 
00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059 align:start position:0%
interest in that representative trip
 
00:26:42.059 --> 00:26:42.890 align:start position:0%
interest in that representative trip
um

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative Perez how about somebody
 
00:26:53.409 --> 00:26:53.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
the Rd Isle yes
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
that representative yes I'm interested
 
00:27:07.549 --> 00:27:07.559 align:start position:0%
okay okay all right good so got drafted
 
00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:08.690 align:start position:0%
okay okay all right good so got drafted
yes

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
be informal so
 
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.810 align:start position:0%
be informal so
um

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
I think this works both ways I know
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
there's something in court right now
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
about a
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
people who are mentioned in
 
00:27:25.279 --> 00:27:27.169 align:start position:0%
people who are mentioned in
letters

00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
letters
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
not being able to get
 
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
that letter
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
say if you wrote a letter against me
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
and I wanted that letter to see that
 
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
letter it's some places are withholding
 
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
that even with a right to know so it has
 
00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:45.419 align:start position:0%
gone to court it is in court
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
so I think it works both ways it also
 
00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:51.539 align:start position:0%
could work towards that
 
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
helping that as well am I making sense
 
00:27:57.769 --> 00:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
uh because people because if I have a
 
00:27:59.570 --> 00:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
letter against me and you won't share it
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
with me you just say oh so and so said
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
you're blah blah blah
 
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
I should have a right to get that letter
 
00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
and I think people are
 
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
not allowing that to happen with the
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
right to know and I think this could
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
help that as well
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
okay that might be the case I mean one
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
of the big
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
issue that that I was still left with on
 
00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:24.539 align:start position:0%
652 is
 
00:28:24.539 --> 00:28:26.029 align:start position:0%
652 is
the

00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
how you know the way it
 
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
the way the statute now is worded if if
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
this is going to be there's a there's a
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
there's a right of to have a meeting uh
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
not public if there's going to be if
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to be talking about someone
 
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
that in a way that might adversely
 
00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
affect the person's reputation and the
 
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
pro and and the proposal was if that's
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
the case then you ought to give notice
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
to that person right and the problem I
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
have is
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
that's awfully broad I mean I tried I
 
00:28:59.690 --> 00:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
think maybe after hearing talk about you
 
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
know what if the person that you're
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
going to be talking adversely about
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
lives and lives in Singapore do you you
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
know do you have to give notice to that
 
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.549 align:start position:0%
know do you have to give notice to that
person

00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
um or or what you know if it does it
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
make a difference whether the person
 
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be talking about is
 
00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:15.539 align:start position:0%
a citizen of the of the jurisdiction
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
that's going to be having the discussion
 
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh as as opposed to not
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
um I I I I'm I guess I'm just worried
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
about sort of unintended consequences
 
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
that um of of of of uh
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
imposing the notice but maybe there's a
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
way that we can you know that we can
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
narrow that in a in a to that would make
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
sense to everybody so
 
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.029 align:start position:0%
sense to everybody so
um

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
isn't that a good example of why we need
 
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee to talk about these
 
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
things and just work it out and we
 
00:29:51.049 --> 00:29:51.059 align:start position:0%
certainly never want to interfere with
 
00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
anyone's right to travel right right
 
00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
that's very true so I so I right now I
 
00:30:00.649 --> 00:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
have uh Lynn Tripp Perez and Delorenzo
 
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
um anyone else have an interest in
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
working on that subcommittee and uh does
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
somebody want to volunteer to be the
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'll volunteer
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
I'll be the chair
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
all right there we go there you go and
 
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo will be the
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:30:26.279 --> 00:30:27.590 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.029 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
I have a question yeah since uh these
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
are subcommittee meetings I I assume
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
there's some requirement for record
 
00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:39.419 align:start position:0%
keeping the minutes or something is that
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
correct uh yeah yeah right so uh would
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
would we need a secretary or uh would
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
there be a a researcher which would be
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
present during these meetings that could
 
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
do that I think the researchers um are
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
already overworked and we won't
 
00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
have them assume the responsibility that
 
00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
should be held by someone on the
 
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
committee but it's since you don't need
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
to know in advance I would suggest when
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
the first meeting of the subcommittee is
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
called and people have rested and
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
recuperated over the summer
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
um somebody will likely be willing to
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
step up and say they would serve as
 
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
Clerk of the subcommittee I don't think
 
00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
that's needs to happen now all that
 
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
needs to happen is there has to be
 
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
someone authorized to call the first
 
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
meeting and we're doing that by naming
 
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
the chairs right
 
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.250 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:57.409 --> 00:31:57.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.090 --> 00:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:03.299 align:start position:0%
um the next uh is 283 House Bill 283
 
00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
this is the bill that limits rental
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
application fees to 35 or the cost of
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
the background check whichever is less
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
and then there's some other
 
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
um all other I think if I'm
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
if I've summarized correctly I think the
 
00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
language of the original Bill said all
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
other fees charge as a part of the
 
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
application process must be refundable
 
00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.130 align:start position:0%
application process must be refundable
um

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
anybody have an interest in working on
 
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.070 align:start position:0%
anybody have an interest in working on
that

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580 align:start position:0%

00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%

I'm sure why not all right or again
 
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:20.029 align:start position:0%
 
trip

00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%

um

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.049 align:start position:0%
 
man

00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059 align:start position:0%
man
 
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
um I I'm comfortable doing it if that's
 
00:33:41.169 --> 00:33:41.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:48.299 align:start position:0%
uh all right uh House Bill 641 LED
 
00:33:48.299 --> 00:33:53.769 align:start position:0%
uh all right uh House Bill 641 LED
inspections

00:33:53.769 --> 00:33:53.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
oh all right I'm sorry yeah no if we
 
00:33:59.289 --> 00:33:59.299 align:start position:0%
could do 360. that's fine um
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah no I had it in a different order
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
362. this is the bill that eliminates
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
the right of um
 
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
that the proposal was that the this bill
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
would eliminate the right of a defendant
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
to remove cases from the Human Rights
 
00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:20.690 align:start position:0%
to remove cases from the Human Rights
Commission

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:23.339 align:start position:0%
after the Human Rights Commission finds
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong I please anyway anybody on
 
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
the committee correct me I think one of
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
our concerns on this was we um
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
thought that there might be broader
 
00:34:43.609 --> 00:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
issues with the Human Rights Commission
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
in terms of um of the timeliness of
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
of its work product and stuff like that
 
00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:51.419 align:start position:0%
and I think that among other things was
 
00:34:51.419 --> 00:34:52.730 align:start position:0%
and I think that among other things was
what

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
um was what sort of led to it being
 
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
retained so
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
um do people have an interest in working
 
00:34:59.810 --> 00:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
representative Manos
 
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099 align:start position:0%
D Lorenzo I I believe that all the
 
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
issues um
 
00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.390 align:start position:0%
issues um
around

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:35:11.089 --> 00:35:11.099 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission are being
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
taken care of and I think it would make
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
sense to
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
test the bill
 
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
it's straight it's clear-cut and it's
 
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
the building speaker
 
00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm sorry representative kuta
 
00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
respectfully I I'd love to join it I
 
00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.290 align:start position:0%
respectfully I I'd love to join it I
think

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:53.339 align:start position:0%
I appreciate all the work that was done
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just very concerned
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
that the number of cases that are being
 
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
to be frank it seemed like the the
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
committee was dysfunctional like it
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't completing cases I mean the
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
number that had been completed per year
 
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
was so low and it seems like this is
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
just putting a Band-Aid onto it and I do
 
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate the work that was
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
done and I and I mean no disrespect I
 
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:20.579 align:start position:0%
just think we need to do a little bit of
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
a deeper dive to see why it's taking so
 
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
long to complete these cases having
 
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
somebody pull them out is one thing but
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
if they're just not able to complete the
 
00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
cases that's not servicing anybody so we
 
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
need to figure out either how to get
 
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
them to service the cases or if the
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
model just isn't working
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
maybe the cases need to be moved to a
 
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
court and we need to be funding the cost
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
of it being completed in court but but
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
to have a commission that
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
cases are just sitting you know in a
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
black hole and nobody's getting any
 
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
findings it just doesn't seem right you
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
know that for anybody involved
 
00:36:58.970 --> 00:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
yes representative D Lorenzo uh thank
 
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
um addressing um
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
representative kotob's concerns um there
 
00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
an audit a performance audit by the LBA
 
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
and that will be this year it could be
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
could have even started
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
um additionally
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
um the governor
 
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
um authorized spending for another
 
00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:29.099 align:start position:0%
um worker in the Human Rights Commission
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
office so that's why I feel that things
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
are being taken care of all right thank
 
00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:35.099 align:start position:0%
you fine so you know what the the one I
 
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
guess what I one of the things that um
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
that I think is an issue here is that um
 
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.910 align:start position:0%
that I think is an issue here is that um
the

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.050 align:start position:0%
the
the

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
main argument As I understood it of the
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
people who wanted who Advocate the
 
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:52.740 align:start position:0%
change that was proposing the bill was
 
00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:55.619 align:start position:0%
it's on it's unfair the way the way the
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
law works right now
 
00:37:59.329 --> 00:37:59.339 align:start position:0%
a claimant
 
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
has mud is required to file a claimant
 
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
who claims that they were uh that they
 
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
were discriminated against in violation
 
00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:11.099 align:start position:0%
of the Human Rights Act has to go to the
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission with the
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
complaint in the first instance
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
and then is not allowed to remove the
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
matter for I believe it's 180 days
 
00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
um at the 180 day point they can remove
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
if they want to but they don't have to
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
the plan the claimant doesn't have to
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
the way the law works right now
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
once the Human Rights Commission
 
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
by uh makes a finding of probable cause
 
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
and as I recall
 
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
that was one of the big problems is that
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
it took an inordinate amount of
 
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
sometimes years for the for the Human
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission to make a finding of
 
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
probable cause which is hard to
 
00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
understand but
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
but the the argument was that under the
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
laws now written once the Human Rights
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
Commission makes a finding of probable
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
cause the the defendant is then allowed
 
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
to remove the case to Superior Court and
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
the argument and I think it was a good a
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
valid argument by the by the CL by the
 
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's bar for lack of a better
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
term was that's unfair to have a
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
plaintiff be have be required to wait
 
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
all this time for the Human Rights
 
00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
Commission to make a determination and
 
00:39:29.329 --> 00:39:29.339 align:start position:0%
then allow the the defendant to set to
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
remove the case at that point I I
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
thought that was a was a compelling
 
00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:38.099 align:start position:0%
argument but the the to me the answer to
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
that is not to eliminate the defendant's
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
right to remove at all rather I had
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
proposed an amendment uh that would have
 
00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.710 align:start position:0%
proposed an amendment uh that would have
said

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
let's change the law to say this the
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
plaintiff we'll leave the law the way it
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
is for for in this regard the plaintiff
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
has to go to the Human Rights Commission
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
first and cannot remove the case from
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission for for 180
 
00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.770 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission for for 180
days

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
but let's change the law to say once
 
00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:11.180 align:start position:0%
that 180 day period has been has expired
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
now the clock starts to run on the
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
defendant the defendant will have 60
 
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
days after that 180 days to either
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
remove the case to the superior court or
 
00:40:26.569 --> 00:40:26.579 align:start position:0%
if if the defendant doesn't then the
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
defendant is barred from from doing it
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
at all that eliminates the art the the
 
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
the complaint that the you know the
 
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
defendant is just sort of sitting on
 
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
their hands and letting lots and lots of
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
time go by and then uh and then removing
 
00:40:43.849 --> 00:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
the case the defendant would be required
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
to do it right away
 
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
or or not remove it at all and so I mean
 
00:40:50.569 --> 00:40:50.579 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that's the only solution
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not saying that the that you
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
know we shouldn't consider the the the
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
the terms of the original bill but I do
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
have a real problem with the idea of of
 
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
completely eliminating the defendant's
 
00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
right to remove
 
00:41:07.609 --> 00:41:07.619 align:start position:0%
um particularly
 
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
given what seems to be
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
the time problem
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
um with the uh with the Human Rights
 
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
Commission so I I guess I that's a long
 
00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:19.619 align:start position:0%
way of saying I think that something
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
does need to be worked on here and I'm
 
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
glad that uh representative
 
00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.630 align:start position:0%
glad that uh representative
uh

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
and uh Manos and representative
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
dilorenzo do you have some interest in
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
working on this also
 
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
Delorenzo anyone else that's interested
 
00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:41.339 align:start position:0%
okay uh hang on

Oregon

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
who else
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
who would like to be chair
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
all right representative cuta
 
00:42:05.569 --> 00:42:05.579 align:start position:0%
and representative Manos would you like
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
to be Vice chair
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
all right got it
 
00:42:11.569 --> 00:42:11.579 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:12.770 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
so next
 
00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.290 align:start position:0%
so next
um

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
is uh house bill 396.
 
00:42:19.079 --> 00:42:22.190 align:start position:0%
is uh house bill 396.
um

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
so let here's here's my impression on
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
396 and if I'm if I'm
 
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
my sense is that we are
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
so far apart on this that I I mean
 
00:42:38.569 --> 00:42:38.579 align:start position:0%
is there any chance that we're going to
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
be able to come to an agreement on this
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just kind of wondering I mean my
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
sense is that no that we're gonna we're
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
gonna have a 10-10 vote uh
 
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh in November when we have to vote and
 
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
that that's you know that's the way the
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation will go to the floor in
 
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
next January but there's
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
is there I mean do people have a Mr
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
chair I can't predict
 
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
um what would happen I can tell you that
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
although representative Macbeth is not
 
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh able to be with us today she has
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
indicated to me that if there were to be
 
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee she would like to serve
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
on that so I just want to okay mention
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
um well do I just did anybody else have
 
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
an interest in serving
 
00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:30.370 align:start position:0%
an interest in serving
foreign

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:30.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
if if you're if you're required to come
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
up with a committee I'd like to serve on
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
it but I will say that it's the only one
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
who voted against us on the on the
 
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
Republican side uh because I it was
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
something that obviously needed more
 
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.349 align:start position:0%
something that obviously needed more
work

00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
and it I took an awful lot of heat for
 
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
that uh and and so if you're going to do
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
it again I'd like to sit on the
 
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
committee but I do not support the bill
 
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:08.339 align:start position:0%
so representative uh Macbeth you said
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
was something if the group decides to
 
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.690 align:start position:0%
was something if the group decides to
have

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative I'd like to serve on
 
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
the committee and I think we need to
 
00:44:20.089 --> 00:44:20.099 align:start position:0%
re-look at the bill
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot that's happened in New
 
00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:25.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since this bill came up
 
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.010 align:start position:0%
uh that
um

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
has come to the Forefront so I I think
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
that um perhaps
 
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
being well informed and and
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
understanding the bill Moore May sway
 
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
people one way or the other for or
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
against it so I really feel that in in
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
light of what's going on we really need
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
to readdress this all right so I have
 
00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.450 align:start position:0%

sure that's fine not here exactly that's
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.359 --> 00:46:19.930 align:start position:0%
 
just

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:19.940 align:start position:0%

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
we have a volunteer for cheer uh that's
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
been known to happen
 
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
so let's see all right
 
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:31.500 align:start position:0%

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
let me summarize what my understanding
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
is and people correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
original this the original bill here was
 
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
designed to have to give the Department
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
of Education
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
the ability to file
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh and prosecute for lack prosecutes
 
00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
probably the wrong word but but I'm
 
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
gonna use it anyway uh the ability to
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
file and prosecute
 
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.190 align:start position:0%
file and prosecute
um

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
complaints of a civil nature obviously
 
00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:12.839 align:start position:0%
not criminal but uh prosecute uh
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
complaints alleging violation of the
 
00:47:19.609 --> 00:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Act in arising in from in
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
the educational con educational setting
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
of a school or whatever
 
00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh that the Department of Education
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
would be able to
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
itself prosecute those cases before the
 
00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission
 
00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:32.890 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission
um

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:32.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
that as I understand it would have made
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education the only
 
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
agency other than the the attorney
 
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
general that would have the ability to
 
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
directly prosecute cases before the
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission
 
00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.490 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission
and

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
um I think a number of us not not
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
everyone for sure but a number of us
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
including myself had questions about why
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
we should make why there should be this
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
special exception for the Department of
 
00:48:00.119 --> 00:48:01.609 align:start position:0%
special exception for the Department of
Education

00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
um as a result I I think of maybe for a
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
number of reasons but as a result of
 
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
partially I think of of
 
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
this some of the skepticism that was
 
00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
expressed by the committee
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Education has
 
00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.430 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Education has
um

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
either has or is in the process of
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
working out an arrangement with the
 
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
Department with the Department of
 
00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
Justice the Attorney General's office
 
00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.430 align:start position:0%
Justice the Attorney General's office
about

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.370 align:start position:0%
about
how

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
they will work together so that if
 
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
there's a if the Department of Education
 
00:48:38.569 --> 00:48:38.579 align:start position:0%
believes that something there's
 
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:41.220 align:start position:0%
something that uh should be prosecuted
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
so to speak before the Human Rights
 
00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.910 align:start position:0%
so to speak before the Human Rights
Commission

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.510 align:start position:0%
Commission
um

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
they can work with the Attorney
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
General's office and eventually the
 
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:49.140 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office would make a
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether they would do
 
00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:55.790 align:start position:0%
that so
that

00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:59.450 --> 00:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
the main part of the bill my sense is
 
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
is there's no need for us to take any
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
further action on the main part of the
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
bill right now now
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
having said that I the the
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
what came up next in that was the the
 
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
um there was a suggestion by the
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Education that an
 
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill should be drafted
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
which I agreed with and I drafted the
 
00:49:23.089 --> 00:49:23.099 align:start position:0%
amendment to give the Department of
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
Education subpoena power
 
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
really in a different context The
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
subpoena power was just was designed to
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
give the Department of Education
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
subpoena power
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
so that they so that it could subpoena
 
00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.990 align:start position:0%
so that they so that it could subpoena
records

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:49:41.569 --> 00:49:41.579 align:start position:0%
in cases in which the Department of
 
00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
Education would itself be holding
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
hearings dealing with for example uh
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
allegations that that Educators had
 
00:49:53.569 --> 00:49:53.579 align:start position:0%
violated the the code of conduct for
 
00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term for educators
 
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
we had a hearing on that
 
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
um and as I recall the emotion on that I
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
made a motion to approve that it failed
 
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
on a 10 to 10 vote
 
00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.069 align:start position:0%
on a 10 to 10 vote
um

00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:11.870 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.809 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:50:14.809 --> 00:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
having spoken to the clerk my
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.130 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
that

00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
if this bill dies
 
00:50:26.329 --> 00:50:26.339 align:start position:0%
there would be nothing to prevent
 
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
someone and and I have to say it
 
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
probably would be me introducing the the
 
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
substance of the amendment as a new bill
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
next year and I probably would would do
 
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
something like that maybe with some
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
changes but in other words there'd be
 
00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:41.990 align:start position:0%
changes but in other words there'd be
nothing

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh preventing uh the introduction of a
 
00:50:48.049 --> 00:50:48.059 align:start position:0%
bill uh dealing with the subpoena power
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
issue so
 
00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.589 align:start position:0%
issue so
um

00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:53.569 --> 00:50:53.579 align:start position:0%
that is that would be kind of my
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
inclination is to do is to not do
 
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
anything with the main Bill and then
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
next year I'll introduce that Amendment
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
or something like that and there were
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
some people uh some people during the
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
hearing on the amendment had raised
 
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
issues about whether there would be
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
whether there should be some changes to
 
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
the text of of my legislation and I'm
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
perfectly open Perfectly you know open
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
to those kind of suggestions but that
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
would so my suggestion would be not to
 
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
do anything with the main bill
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
um I understand
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh and appreciate what you said but by
 
00:51:37.849 --> 00:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
the very nature of you saying it
 
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
um I think you serve to remind all of us
 
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
that there were disparate views within
 
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
this committee on that bill and it it
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily come down in any
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
traditional way as to why people felt
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
one thing or the other and if there are
 
00:51:59.809 --> 00:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
people willing to participate
 
00:51:59.819 --> 00:52:00.410 align:start position:0%
people willing to participate
um

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:02.329 --> 00:52:02.339 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:52:02.339 --> 00:52:03.770 align:start position:0%
I think that
um

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:06.290 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
I think it might be helpful for us to
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee to take a look at it
 
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
take a look at your Amendment took a
 
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
look at the underlying language and that
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
other factors that have actually come to
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
pass since we looked at this earlier in
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
the spring oh no well well I know I'm
 
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
happy to hear that I mean my my sense
 
00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
and I've been and if to the extent that
 
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
I've been misreading this my sense
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
from the discussion at the hearing on
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
there was a group that that the the
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
people at on on one side of the aisle
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term didn't want to
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
have the Department of Education have
 
00:52:55.849 --> 00:52:55.859 align:start position:0%
subpoena power
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
period and so if that's if that's not
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
the case then I'm then that's great I'm
 
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm very happy to have a
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative I volunteered for
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
enough subcommittees I'm on two already
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
and I was playing to be on zero but so
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's in common with this one which was
 
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:15.410 align:start position:0%
it's in common with this one which was
um

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:17.579 align:start position:0%
and we saw this in a debate on the bill
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
that went through education we debated
 
00:53:19.079 --> 00:53:19.910 align:start position:0%
that went through education we debated
if

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago which is um
 
00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take in the entire uh
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
Universe of publicly funded education I
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
guess the schools or school districts
 
00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
which I guess does at least take in
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
charge of public schools as well as
 
00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
conventional Public Schools but still
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
leaves out
 
00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:38.579 align:start position:0%
the non-public Academy such as Pinkerton
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
or Co Brown it doesn't take in uh out of
 
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.890 align:start position:0%
or Co Brown it doesn't take in uh out of
state

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:46.740 align:start position:0%
uh public schools that were tuitioning
 
00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
students into
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
and it also doesn't take in uh the
 
00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
providers and the
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
EFA program amongst others so like it's
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh the pillows introduced is also like
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh incomplete because it doesn't empower
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education to intercede
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
in on behalf of all uh you know
 
00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:08.339 align:start position:0%
of all
 
00:54:08.339 --> 00:54:08.930 align:start position:0%
of all
um

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
families who are using uh publicly
 
00:54:13.609 --> 00:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
funded education but I think I mean I
 
00:54:13.619 --> 00:54:14.930 align:start position:0%
funded education but I think I mean I
think

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
I think my presence on the subcommittee
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
is unnecessary and I think the whole
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
bill is unnecessary but I just thought
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's just a flaw in the
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
original bill which uh I guess actually
 
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
your Amendment does kind of uh at least
 
00:54:29.569 --> 00:54:29.579 align:start position:0%
implicitly uh bypass but so that's just
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
my comment on it all right so uh yes
 
00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:44.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
it's not working oh geez
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
just talk loudly I'll speak I'll just uh
 
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
if there is a subcommittee then I would
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
I would I would volunteer well
 
00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
representation if you seem to think that
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
it would be worthwhile and I'm that's
 
00:54:59.099 --> 00:55:00.250 align:start position:0%
it would be worthwhile and I'm that's
fine

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:00.260 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:07.140 align:start position:0%
who else wants to okay
 
00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
all right so we have so we've got uh
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
Paige Smith
 
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry dude Lorenzo uh no I'm
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
sorry Lance sorry about that lonza
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
um we need another at least one
 
00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
that sound so we've got five people who
 
00:55:41.809 --> 00:55:41.819 align:start position:0%
top page Smith lonza and Tripp
 
00:55:48.130 --> 00:55:48.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
if you want to be chair you can beat you
 
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.589 align:start position:0%
if you want to be chair you can beat you
okay

00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:03.049 --> 00:56:03.059 align:start position:0%
all right all right uh so you know what
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
I think this dealt more with
 
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:10.730 align:start position:0%
I think this dealt more with
um

00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
people having access
 
00:56:13.079 --> 00:56:14.450 align:start position:0%
people having access
to

00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:15.530 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
putting things before the Human Rights
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
Commission and more than subpoena I
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
think this had to deal with one of the
 
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:26.540 align:start position:0%
big things that came up and
 
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
hearing from parents that
 
00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
make complaints they can't
 
00:56:33.059 --> 00:56:34.430 align:start position:0%
make complaints they can't
afford

00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
afford
 
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
to follow through on complaints
 
00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
whereas if the Department of Education
 
00:56:43.849 --> 00:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
was helping them with that or filing for
 
00:56:43.859 --> 00:56:45.230 align:start position:0%
was helping them with that or filing for
them

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
um I just had a guy from a parent this
 
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
morning who had filed a complaint
 
00:56:54.049 --> 00:56:54.059 align:start position:0%
cost her seven thousand dollars to file
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
a complaint
 
00:56:58.730 --> 00:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
um it was for special ed
 
00:56:58.740 --> 00:56:59.930 align:start position:0%
um it was for special ed
um

00:56:59.930 --> 00:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
young parents can't afford that that's
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I think they were
 
00:57:08.569 --> 00:57:08.579 align:start position:0%
looking for in this in in I may be wrong
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
but I think that's one of the things if
 
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
the doe can file complaints
 
00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
against human rights or against
 
00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
what people are doing they need someone
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that because they
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to do it so that's just a
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
comment right I I I mean I I guess the
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
uh As I understood the original bill it
 
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
I don't think it dealt with special
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
education as I thought it was like a
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
claim of discriminate if somebody was
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
claiming discrimination in violation of
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Act
 
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:42.790 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Act
um

00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
maybe I mean maybe it is Broad enough to
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
to Encompass that but I guess the thing
 
00:57:50.809 --> 00:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
the thing that was never clear to me is
 
00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
why isn't why should the Department of
 
00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.309 align:start position:0%
why isn't why should the Department of
Education

00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:57:55.319 --> 00:57:56.809 align:start position:0%
Education
have

00:57:56.809 --> 00:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
a special ability to prosecute cases
 
00:58:02.569 --> 00:58:02.579 align:start position:0%
before the Human Rights Commission
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
whereas for example suppose that suppose
 
00:58:08.089 --> 00:58:08.099 align:start position:0%
that there's a claim that um
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
that in something dealing with the
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
transportation department that somebody
 
00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
um somebody had somebody in the
 
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:17.460 align:start position:0%
transportation department has violated
 
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Act
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
um the transportation department can't
 
00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:23.099 align:start position:0%
prosecute the case before the Human
 
00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission they have to go to the
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
attorney general and so why should the
 
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education be treated any
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
differently that's
 
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
I think it came up very clear from um
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
attorney Diana Fenton saying that we're
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
dealing with children having the right
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
to be educated and their parents having
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
a right to speak for them and I think
 
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things
 
00:58:47.089 --> 00:58:47.099 align:start position:0%
that came up because they don't have
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
someone representing them the doe
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
basically because children have a right
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
to be educated the doe is representing
 
00:58:58.730 --> 00:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
the children and the parents
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay I'm I'm still not clear why why the
 
00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
why the Department of Justice wouldn't
 
00:59:07.609 --> 00:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
be in a position to do that but anyway I
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
um but you know what I you know what I
 
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
guess I would uh I'm sorry
 
00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:12.770 align:start position:0%
guess I would uh I'm sorry
representative

00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
I I was thinking that um
 
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out how a public
 
00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:20.030 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out how a public
school

00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
could go before human rights
 
00:59:22.319 --> 00:59:22.970 align:start position:0%
could go before human rights
um

00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
when we have
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
when they
 
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission has bigger fish
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
to fry
 
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
um in protecting people under protected
 
00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:35.150 align:start position:0%
um in protecting people under protected
classes

00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
classes
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
um so in a public school isn't a public
 
00:59:37.319 --> 00:59:38.630 align:start position:0%
um so in a public school isn't a public
class

00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
or a protective class
 
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
right but I guess as I understood it I
 
00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:46.700 align:start position:0%
mean I I guess the the the
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
quintessential case that I thought
 
00:59:49.559 --> 00:59:51.890 align:start position:0%
quintessential case that I thought
was

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:53.150 align:start position:0%
was
um

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
that I that I thought this the original
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
bill would deal with would be a
 
01:00:00.289 --> 01:00:00.299 align:start position:0%
situation like this suppose that there's
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
a claim
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
that a teacher in a public school
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
discriminated on the basis of race or
 
01:00:09.049 --> 01:00:09.059 align:start position:0%
sex or whatever the you know whatever
 
01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
other protected class against the
 
01:00:11.099 --> 01:00:12.950 align:start position:0%
other protected class against the
student

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
um that the
 
01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:18.839 align:start position:0%
the original bill would purport to allow
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
to bring a to prosecute an action in
 
01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
behalf of that student before the Human
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission and
 
01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.289 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission and
the

01:00:33.289 --> 01:00:33.299 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
the problem that that I had and I think
 
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
I think some other people on the
 
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
committee shared it is
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
under the current law in that situation
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
that I gave as an example
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice could
 
01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
prosecute that case before the Human
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission and so
 
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
why isn't that good enough
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
um there's no I don't you know it's I I
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
do remember there being some
 
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
suggestion that
 
01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:02.809 align:start position:0%
suggestion that
um

01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:05.809 --> 01:01:05.819 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice wasn't
 
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
taking those cases but it really sort of
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
seemed to me was that
 
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
what was really being what was really
 
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
happening is there may have been a
 
01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
disagreement between the Department of
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
Justice and the Department of Education
 
01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:21.299 align:start position:0%
as to whether some particular case was
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
worth it was worth Prosecuting
 
01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:25.430 align:start position:0%
worth it was worth Prosecuting
um

01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
I spent enough time as a prosecutor to
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
know that there were a lot of times when
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
the FBI or the DEA or the police really
 
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
thought somebody should be prosecuted
 
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
and the the prosecutor didn't and so in
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
that you know the prosecutor decides and
 
01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
that's just the way
 
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
um that's sort of the way it goes um but
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
anyway the one other comment I wanted to
 
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
make and I'm wondering if this
 
01:01:55.609 --> 01:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
subcommittee could at least think about
 
01:01:59.289 --> 01:01:59.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
my

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
my sense is
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
that any
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
any agency that has the authority to
 
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.309 align:start position:0%
any agency that has the authority to
take

01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
some kind of disciplinary action whether
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's the Department of Education or the
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
transfer whatever whatever the agency is
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
if an agency has the authority to
 
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
conduct hearings and take disciplinary
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
action that agency ought to have
 
01:02:27.049 --> 01:02:27.059 align:start position:0%
subpoena power it shouldn't be I mean I
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
know it can be the it can be the
 
01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation or the Fish
 
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
and Game Commission or whatever it is if
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
they have the authority to conduct
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
investigations and conduct and hold
 
01:02:38.569 --> 01:02:38.579 align:start position:0%
hearings and take some action against
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
somebody they ought to have the power to
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
issue subpoenas
 
01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:45.500 align:start position:0%
um there you know that that doesn't
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
subpoena's uh that doesn't mean that
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
they can go out you know that we're
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
going to give them all guns and they can
 
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
go out and and execute search warrants
 
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
but it does mean that they can issue a
 
01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.150 align:start position:0%
but it does mean that they can issue a
subpoena

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
subpoena
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
it should mean that they can issue a
 
01:02:59.690 --> 01:02:59.700 align:start position:0%
subpoena and if somebody gets a subpoena
 
01:03:02.089 --> 01:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
and thinks that there's not a valid
 
01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
basis for the subpoena being issued they
 
01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
can go to court just to quash The
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
subpoena that's the way it yeah I think
 
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
it should work for all agencies so I
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm suggesting is maybe this
 
01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.829 align:start position:0%
what I'm suggesting is maybe this
subcommittee

01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
ought to think about whether it would
 
01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:18.740 align:start position:0%
make sense with under whatever
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
conditions the the subcommittee thinks
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate to to more
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
generally say that agencies that have
 
01:03:28.849 --> 01:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
that kind of authority should have
 
01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
subpoena power that's that's my
 
01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.750 align:start position:0%
subpoena power that's that's my
suggestion

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:36.289 align:start position:0%
suggestion
yes

01:03:36.289 --> 01:03:36.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm kind of recalling right or wrong
 
01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:42.650 align:start position:0%
um I'm kind of recalling right or wrong
that

01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
there's a Complaint Form or process for
 
01:03:46.799 --> 01:03:47.990 align:start position:0%
there's a Complaint Form or process for
um

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
students and parents to file with the
 
01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
school or Department of Education
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's correct or not but
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
I thought I I heard that in some
 
01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.109 align:start position:0%
I thought I I heard that in some
testimony

01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
and and if there is online or Complaint
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
Form or a process within the school or
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
01:04:08.819 --> 01:04:10.190 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
then

01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:04:12.289 --> 01:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
they must certainly be able to do
 
01:04:14.329 --> 01:04:14.339 align:start position:0%
something with that including
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
investigate or maybe refer
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
depending upon the seriousness of the
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
case and the particulars of it
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
breaking away from that thought for a
 
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
moment did you say that the Department
 
01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
of Education is working with the Human
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission to develop some kind
 
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:36.299 align:start position:0%
of cooperation on this matter no I'm
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
sorry I was saying that with regards to
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
the the subject of the original bill
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
the proposal to give the Department of
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
Education kind of the direct authority
 
01:04:50.329 --> 01:04:50.339 align:start position:0%
to prosecute cases before the Human
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
their their my understanding was is that
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education was working
 
01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Justice
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
to uh to prepare some kind of a
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
uh not that would give
 
01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education the
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
authority to actually undertake those
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
prosecutions but a process whereby
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
they would consult with each other and
 
01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Justice would then
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
make a you know a more informed decision
 
01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
about what cases they they that that is
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice would
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
prosecute involving educational alleged
 
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
educational discrimination and does that
 
01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
work that way now uh as a practical
 
01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
matter in some way well
 
01:05:43.089 --> 01:05:43.099 align:start position:0%
I I I I I I
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
think it the answer is it should but I
 
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
think that was part of the problem that
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
the education was was frustrated with
 
01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
that they they believe that
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
it was not working well that the
 
01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
relationship between
 
01:05:59.690 --> 01:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
education the Department of Education
 
01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:01.619 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Justice was not
 
01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
working as smoothly as it should have
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
and they were trying to
 
01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
work something out to uh to make it work
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
more smoothly and I thought and my
 
01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
understanding was that they had actually
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
made some they they made some progress
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
on in fact it may it may be that by now
 
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
they actually have a memorandum I'm
 
01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
saying I don't know that but um maybe
 
01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:23.339 align:start position:0%
they do so education takes complaints
 
01:06:26.569 --> 01:06:26.579 align:start position:0%
but then they did end some way or they
 
01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
go fallow is that
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
they're not being for well executed to
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
I I think it I mean that that may be
 
01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
true in some cases I think that may that
 
01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
might be true yes uh uh representative
 
01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
Perez and then representative Morgan
 
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
I just got this from a parent
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
um last night at 6 35. it was a
 
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
complaint that was made to the
 
01:06:55.609 --> 01:06:55.619 align:start position:0%
Department of Education it involved her
 
01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
special ed child
 
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
um and she had to get a lawyer to do
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
this correctly which is a cost to a
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
parent the biggest problem it's my
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
understanding that the Department of
 
01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
Education has not having subpoena power
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
is if they go to the SAU and say we need
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
the record of
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
this you know how many hours of this did
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
the child blah blah blah
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're having trouble getting it
 
01:07:26.529 --> 01:07:26.539 align:start position:0%
because they do not have subpoena power
 
01:07:29.089 --> 01:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
that this ruling
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
States in it that they were unable to
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
get some of the information that they
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
were looking for so I think that's the
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
problem and I think that's what they
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
said when they came and talked about it
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
is they don't always they don't always
 
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
have access what
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
to what they need to make an informed
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
decision so I think the process works
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
but the subpoena power is necessary so
 
01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
that they can
 
01:08:00.049 --> 01:08:00.059 align:start position:0%
do their job representative Horgan
 
01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:02.339 align:start position:0%
yes I think I'm worried this might
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
create a conflict of interest for the
 
01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Education since they also
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh work you know they also like work to
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
support the schools in the school
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
district so they're um
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure where they're having an
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
adversarial so they're sort of like a
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
strange situation if they're advocating
 
01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
on behalf of a parent against the school
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
although it is certainly
 
01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
the core function of the primary
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
education to make sure that the schools
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
and the school districts and so forth
 
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
are doing their jobs effectively and
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
correctly so like you know there's uh
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
they do have a vested interest in making
 
01:08:38.209 --> 01:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
sure that these schools provide the
 
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
right services that the children but I'm
 
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
not sure if they're intervening on
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of the parents in the lawsuit
 
01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
directly like that that seems to place a
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
lot of their that seems to create a
 
01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest situation where
 
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
they've divided loyalties there even
 
01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.729 align:start position:0%
they've divided loyalties there even
though

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:52.739 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
even though on the other hand they're
 
01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
both sides want the children to get the
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
best the appropriate education so I
 
01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.689 align:start position:0%
best the appropriate education so I
think

01:08:59.689 --> 01:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
I think there's like a bit of a
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
conundrum there if we were to pass at
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
least this bill is introduced so
 
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you um this
 
01:09:10.849 --> 01:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
conversation is very interesting and I
 
01:09:14.209 --> 01:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
would suggest that it would be most
 
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have it take place before
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee as the subcommittee
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
members struggle with trying to figure
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a good that sounds like
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
a very good suggestion anybody else have
 
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
anything else they want to say on 533
 
01:09:33.289 --> 01:09:33.299 align:start position:0%
all right so the committee will be
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
chaired by representative Smith Vice
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
chair will be representative koutab the
 
01:09:38.329 --> 01:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
other members are representative page
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
representative Lanza representative
 
01:09:39.839 --> 01:09:41.209 align:start position:0%
representative Lanza representative
Tripp

01:09:41.209 --> 01:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
Tripp
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.870 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
41. okay
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
I I and I know that representative
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair
 
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
originally we had retained this with
 
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
hopes of working on it
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
I right now don't see a need to work on
 
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen like an overwhelming
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
communication regarding this bill
 
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
um from the sponsor or other
 
01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
um lead inspectors that are that seem
 
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
aggrieved with the current law so I'm
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
okay just holding on to it and if there
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
is a dire need in September we could
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
deal with it but I don't think we need
 
01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.850 align:start position:0%
deal with it but I don't think we need
to

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
I I couldn't agree more I could I
 
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree more this I as I think I
 
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
said at the time I never this seemed to
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
me to be a a solution in search of a
 
01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:43.580 align:start position:0%
problem that easily could be solved by
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
the lead inspectors by just getting a
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
getting part part of all of their fee up
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
front if they were worried about getting
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
paid then right so anyway I anybody have
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
a problem with if we don't take any
 
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr we will take action we will
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
take action in the full form right yeah
 
01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
um in the fullness of time right right
 
01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:12.950 align:start position:0%
um in the fullness of time right right
right

01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
question about where you meet do you
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
have to meet here yes yes
 
01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
um you have to meet here you have to uh
 
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
it has to be in the calendar right right
 
01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
so you have to and remember that
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
um the calendar will be every other week
 
01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
for a while I don't remember exactly
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
when it will start to be every week but
 
01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
if you're the chair you have to make
 
01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
sure that you notify Karen who will
 
01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
um do everything that's necessary to get
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
into the calendar and also to have
 
01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
assigned a room for where we would be
 
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
meeting right you know what Paul did
 
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
mention to me though apparently for
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittees only 12 hours notice is is
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh is is good enough I'm not saying we
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't give you know you obviously
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
should try to give as much as possible
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
but I think I I don't know my my
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
um My Philosophy would be
 
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.090 align:start position:0%
um My Philosophy would be
um

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
the more the more heads that come
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
together on these complex issues the
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
better and therefore I always like to
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
give as much notice as possible
 
01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
yeah no I don't disagree with that I'm
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
just saying just I think that just so
 
01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
you know what the apparently the rule is
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
that you only have to give 12 hours but
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
but I agree with you completely it would
 
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
be it'd be better to give as much notice
 
01:12:32.689 --> 01:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
01:12:32.699 --> 01:12:33.649 align:start position:0%
as possible
um

01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
anything else I think we've covered all
 
01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
the bills anything else that we need to
 
01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
talk about now
 
01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
um yeah oh well yes yes
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
um did someone else have their hand up
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
no okay then um this is probably the
 
01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
last time this committee will meet in
 
01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.370 align:start position:0%
last time this committee will meet in
full

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
full
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
um until uh
 
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
the weather warms up a little bit
 
01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:03.860 align:start position:0%
um and I want to take this opportunity
 
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
to thank the chair
 
01:13:11.209 --> 01:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
um on the overwhelming majority of bills
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
that have come before this committee we
 
01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.870 align:start position:0%
that have come before this committee we
have

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
um Universal
 
01:13:20.689 --> 01:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
agreement and we can see that in the
 
01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
votes that have gone to the Full House
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
in the small number of bills where there
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
is not Universal agreement those bills
 
01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
by definition are the bills that are
 
01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.330 align:start position:0%
by definition are the bills that are
most

01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:35.990 align:start position:0%
most
um

01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
contentious and also where people's
 
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
views are most deeply held
 
01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
and for the entire session I believe
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
this committee has been conducted under
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
the chairs leadership
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
recognizing that
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
it doesn't cost a thing to be civil
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
and that respect and civility
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
um can take place no matter how deeply
 
01:14:08.689 --> 01:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
we oppose each other on any particular
 
01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
bills and that
 
01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:12.770 align:start position:0%
bills and that
that

01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
um climate has come from the chairs
 
01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
leadership and I would imagine that I am
 
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
not alone that in fact everyone on the
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
committee would join me in thanking you
 
01:14:25.149 --> 01:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
for your leadership
 
01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
well thanks
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you all very much I I very much
 
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate that representative Smith and
 
01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and I think
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
this has been a really great committee
 
01:14:39.169 --> 01:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
it's been a pleasure to work with all of
 
01:14:42.169 --> 01:14:42.179 align:start position:0%
you I've learned a great deal from from
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
all of you and I think our debates have
 
01:14:46.490 --> 01:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
been I think our discussions and debates
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
have been you know the way they should
 
01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
be representative Stapleton
