terms of adequacy
 
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.910 align:start position:0%

those things represent cordelli he's
here

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:41.420 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.190 align:start position:0%
here
and

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I think you
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
talked about in the hearing was how do
 
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
you define
 
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
the mic the mic thank you one of the
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
things we talked about in the hearing
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
was how do you define the the 0.15 ETC I
 
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
and that was a question which we had
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
um you have in the high school of course
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
to find courses yeah
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
in Middle School you have a lot of that
 
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
same type of
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
block scheduling or scheduling occurring
 
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
in the high school dealing with courses
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
very few of the junior high schools
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
middle schools now are basically uh
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
taking the elementary model
 
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
um and then the elementary model
 
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
wherever your middle school starts or
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
the elementary ends is a totally
 
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
different ball game
 
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:42.829 align:start position:0%
you know so
representative

00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%

thank you very much Rick
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just looking at my notes and
 
00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:49.790 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just looking at my notes and
um

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
we had the hearing on January 27th we
 
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
accepted on March 7th 20 nothing to
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
retain it
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm not showing much on the my
 
00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:02.459 align:start position:0%
hearing notes other than it being
 
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
introduced but I could be wrong on on
 
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
that and was wondering because
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and maybe Glenn can help clear this
 
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
up too because a lot of the language
 
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.490 align:start position:0%
up too because a lot of the language
here

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
seems very very much
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
um you know sort of minutia detailed uh
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
technical language as long as did it
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
come from the Department is this uh
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
something that they're trying to clean
 
00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:27.829 align:start position:0%
something that they're trying to clean
up

00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:28.930 align:start position:0%
up
um

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:28.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh I don't recall actually because there
 
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
was another one that I uh submitted
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
um uh based on a constituent request
 
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
um and I think it might have been this
 
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.569 align:start position:0%
um and I think it might have been this
one

00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
um but I believe I I recall from
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
testimony from uh Miss Davis that they
 
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
did have a national
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
publication that helped them
 
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:00.500 align:start position:0%
separate out
 
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
class time at the elementary school
 
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.509 align:start position:0%
class time at the elementary school
level

00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:04.519 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
I thought that maybe someone from the
 
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:10.019 align:start position:0%
Department would be here today but um so
 
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
so what is what is the problem that this
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
is trying to solve I guess I'm trying to
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
um I I believe the uh there was interest
 
00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:20.449 align:start position:0%
um I I believe the uh there was interest
in

00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.459 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:23.660 align:start position:0%
um participating in
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activities
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
um from homeschoolers and others
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
at additional grade levels other than
 
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
High School
 
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
throw a kiss for it yeah gets rid of
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
high in schools in public right now
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding when you talk
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
about extracurricular or co-curricular
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
as it spells as co-curricular that a
 
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
a person that's a resident of that
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
District but maybe being a homeschooled
 
00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:00.470 align:start position:0%
District but maybe being a homeschooled
kid

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
kid
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
May participate in co-curricular that's
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
my understanding even at the elementary
 
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
level I I see that happening up in my
 
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
neck of the woods
 
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.410 align:start position:0%
neck of the woods
so

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
the original Bill spoke to academic
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
courses and grades once not your bill
 
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
but the original Law spoke solely to
 
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
academic courses academic course in the
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
high school
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement
 
00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:30.590 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement
right

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
um I had thought that it didn't extend
 
00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:34.690 align:start position:0%
um I had thought that it didn't extend
down

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:34.700 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
Beyond even the high school level but my
 
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
memory might be faulty in that regard
 
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
program we have here in law only speaks
 
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
to high school yeah right 0.15
 
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
reimbursement right but with in nhiaa if
 
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:53.060 align:start position:0%
you are
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
are successful in your homeschooling
 
00:13:58.750 --> 00:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
program or in completing the eligibility
 
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
requirements of the high school
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
and a resident of the district you have
 
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
to be at the resident of the district
 
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
you can't be you know in another
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
district one can come in and play hockey
 
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
in that one big and you know that's
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
going to be a form of recruiting
 
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
um but that that was permissible
 
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.750 align:start position:0%
um but that that was permissible
um

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:19.740 align:start position:0%
I just you know
 
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I guess I ain't Glenn am I also
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
asking how do we do this
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
in the elementary school in the middle
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
school I can see it I can see this
 
00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:30.889 align:start position:0%
school I can see it I can see this
happening

00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
um but in um maybe what I can do is uh
 
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'll text Miss Davis and see if she has
 
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
further information on that publication
 
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:45.380 align:start position:0%
that she had referred to at one point
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
that would allow some uh delineation at
 
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:55.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:56.870 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:00.189 --> 00:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
yes represent dry thank you
 
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
I wonder Glenn you don't go too far away
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
please he has work to do sorry
 
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
hey I hear you so
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
technically if you take an EFA you're
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
not a home educated student anymore but
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
you are still educating at home and
 
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
therefore eligible to take place part in
 
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
some of the public schools offerings so
 
00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
this this would take out right this
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
would so this would favor
 
00:15:35.329 --> 00:15:35.339 align:start position:0%
you would have to pay for that if you
 
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
were taking an EF it receiving EFA okay
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
schooling you don't get any
 
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
reimbursement you can go into that
 
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
Athletic program no problem if you have
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
the eligibility academic and attendance
 
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:49.100 align:start position:0%
stuff under control
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
yeah counts yes but do they count in the
 
00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:56.339 align:start position:0%
adma regardless of whether they're paid
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
from the EFA or not I mean so isn't EFA
 
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
student who's educated at home part of
 
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:08.180 align:start position:0%
this adma account
 
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
I I do not believe so
 
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
why not because they can still take part
 
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
right but they are not actually in
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
attendance full time at that facility
 
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
Well none of the home schoolers would be
 
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
right so they're they're not included in
 
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm asking if you're taking out
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
home educated students but but keeping
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
are you keeping the home educated
 
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
students who are in efas who are no
 
00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:43.579 align:start position:0%
longer considered home educated
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
right home educated and EFA it's again
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
or the other right if you're a
 
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
homeschooler you can participate right
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
because you're you're not getting any
 
00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
financial support through the state for
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
your home schooling correct if you're an
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
EFA student you are getting that forty
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
one hundred dollars for the additional
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
amount of money for a differentiate Aid
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
component you would have to then pay to
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
participate in the activities
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
at school
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
right and and are therefore not in the
 
00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:24.230 align:start position:0%
right and and are therefore not in the
adma

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
adma
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
okay because you would have to pay for
 
00:17:29.289 --> 00:17:29.299 align:start position:0%
doing that so who does this apply to
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't already be already
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the elementary in the school
 
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
in the public school
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
if you've taken out Home Educators and
 
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
the efas don't apply
 
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
if the bill was written I think Margaret
 
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.570 align:start position:0%
if the bill was written I think Margaret
for

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
it applies the reimbursement to the high
 
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
school is already in law you get .15 of
 
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
that forty one hundred dollars whatever
 
00:17:54.289 --> 00:17:54.299 align:start position:0%
it might be right
 
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
if you're going to go to the middle
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
school and this is happening and taking
 
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
maybe their U.S history course
 
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
the Middle School cannot get
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for that time the students
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
in there if they're a homeschooler even
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
they will if they are in the high school
 
00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
but we have written this law so it's
 
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
only applicable right now to high school
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
I I think the intent of this and I
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't part of it was to allow this to
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
occur in other grade levels besides 9
 
00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:30.299 align:start position:0%
through 12.
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
correct okay yeah
 
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.090 align:start position:0%
correct okay yeah
um

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
I was gonna make a point but now I lost
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
it I'm still thinking that you have
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
just cut out the categories all right of
 
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
do you see me do you see what I'm saying
 
00:18:59.810 --> 00:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
um Home Educators home educated is
 
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
crossed out
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
and efas don't apply so who's who are we
 
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
okay sorry um but if I could
 
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.370 align:start position:0%
okay sorry um but if I could
um

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:15.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
maybe Mr chairman um am I correct and I
 
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
think that we had corrected the
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
situation uh maybe last year that
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
um the 0.15 was only reimbursed to the
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
district if there were funds available I
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
think we we made a statutory change that
 
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
it would always be paid to the district
 
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
I believe that's the case yeah the best
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
I remember fiscal talking about it and
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
finance approving it
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
Rick yes so how does how would this
 
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.970 align:start position:0%
Rick yes so how does how would this
work

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
let's say um
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
Sue is eligible to have access to
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
curricular courses
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
um for 193.1 colon c I suppose I need to
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
look at that and who was enrolled in a
 
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
school board approved Public School
 
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
Social account is an additional 0.15
 
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
pupil for each such academic course
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
taken in a public school how would that
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
apply to to a student who may be
 
00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:30.539 align:start position:0%
attending a public school out of their a
 
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
school board approved Public School
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
outside of their district and is paying
 
00:20:34.679 --> 00:20:39.289 align:start position:0%
outside of their district and is paying
tuition

00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:39.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
and this applies in the first category
 
00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:45.299 align:start position:0%
of adma the kid could participate in
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
that school's program if it's an open
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
enrollment School
 
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
well I'm just saying we just we just
 
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
passed House Bill 275 which allows
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
School boards to um to approve tuition
 
00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
agreements with with other Public
 
00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
Schools outside of their District so now
 
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
we've got a situation here where a
 
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
student is a member of an adma so
 
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
they're not a member of an admr they
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
don't live in the in the resident
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
they're not a resident of the school
 
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
district they're attending but they're
 
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
attending this school district and now
 
00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
the on a tuition basis from a sending
 
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
district and um and they're getting paid
 
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
tuition from both the sending district
 
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
and maybe from the family as well and
 
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
they're getting an additional 0.15
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
um in in um
 
00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying I I think this would
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
foreign because it says school board
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
does it say a public school in their
 
00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:19.850 align:start position:0%
does it say a public school in their
District

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to tease out the corner
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
so uh so if if uh if a student if a
 
00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:45.419 align:start position:0%
student in a district
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
is attending a public a public school in
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
another District that's been approved by
 
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
the District of residence school board
 
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
on it for a tuition program
 
00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:00.380 align:start position:0%
that the the the out of District school
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't receive adequacy for that
 
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
student they receive tuition from the so
 
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:10.580 align:start position:0%
the the admr
 
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
School receives an adequacy payment
 
00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
yeah but not the adma school
 
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
not the school where the students
 
00:23:21.409 --> 00:23:21.419 align:start position:0%
attending right this would seem to make
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
the school that the students attending
 
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:29.810 align:start position:0%
the school that the students attending
receive

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
why would they
 
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
why would they request this additional
 
00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
.15 when they're already getting the
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
tuition which is
 
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
the adequacy money from the resident
 
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
District paying for about tuition I
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
I don't think they would well I think I
 
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
think they'd get it anyway because they
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
don't have to request adequacy adequacy
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
get it anyway it's compelled by the
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
state yeah
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
the payments are compelled by the state
 
00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.590 align:start position:0%
the payments are compelled by the state
yeah

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
I can't I don't know I think that's a
 
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
really outside type thing I don't think
 
00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.649 align:start position:0%
really outside type thing I don't think
that

00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:06.659 --> 00:24:08.149 align:start position:0%
that
personally

00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
personally
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
why would that receiving District be
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
even looking for that when they're
 
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
getting the compensated for the kid
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
being in that class they get it anyway
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
it would just arrive as part of the
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
adequacy payment I'm not saying it's big
 
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.310 align:start position:0%
adequacy payment I'm not saying it's big
dollars

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
but I I guess I'm
 
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of Lost in the
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
there the receiving School
 
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
is going to get a dma funding based upon
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
are they're going to get admr we changed
 
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:00.049 --> 00:25:00.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.409 --> 00:25:02.419 align:start position:0%
according to
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
193 colon 1-c this only would apply to
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
um non-public public charter schools or
 
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
home educated pupils not those
 
00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.149 align:start position:0%
home educated pupils not those
necessarily

00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
public students tuition to another
 
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.190 align:start position:0%
okay uh
um

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
is that the site on 506 page 506
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
well does anybody have a problem with it
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
I do
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to be fine
 
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
yes I spoke with my local superintendent
 
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
and she came to that same conclusion and
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
we were discussing making it maybe
 
00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
seventh grade seven to twelve
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
because those would be classes assuming
 
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
Middle School was seven seventh grade
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
and up
 
00:26:09.649 --> 00:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
seventh and 8th
 
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
but she had she had the same problem
 
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
with you're going the old high school
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
well she she had the same problem with
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
trying to Define classes in the lower
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
grades I agree with you then Katie I
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
agree I it should be either 6 through 12
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
or 7 through 12.
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
um well I go back though that uh Caitlin
 
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh go back to the point
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
that uh Lynn made earlier that there was
 
00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
a that that national definition for
 
00:26:36.299 --> 00:26:38.149 align:start position:0%
a that that national definition for
courses

00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
courses
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
and that was that I think went beyond
 
00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.110 align:start position:0%
and that was that I think went beyond
just

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
the categorical science Etc
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't what they may be talking
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
about here
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
is that if in fact
 
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
in a fifth grade class for example
 
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
they're going to have a
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
a computer uh keyboarding program
 
00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.059 align:start position:0%
or something
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
that a child could come in for that
 
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.730 align:start position:0%
that a child could come in for that
program

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:06.740 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
or even a language arts program
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
or a foreign language program
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
I think what she was trying to say here
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
that there was in fact a way you can
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
Define the general education categories
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
even at the
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
K the k-6 or at least one sixth area I'm
 
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
not trying to defend it I think that's
 
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
was a point she was trying to make them
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
that you can in fact in elementary do
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
some segmentation around categories and
 
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
it's not just all general education
 
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.029 align:start position:0%
it's not just all general education
stuff

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
you can answer
 
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.570 align:start position:0%
you can answer
something

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.730 align:start position:0%
something
okay

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
okay sorry
 
00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.630 align:start position:0%
okay sorry
yeah

00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
can you see the next page when
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
um representative Milo where you
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned the computer I mean they were
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
talking fifth grade now I mean I taught
 
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
the computer class in fifth grade where
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
I could have homeschoolers who would
 
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.409 align:start position:0%
I could have homeschoolers who would
commands

00:28:12.409 --> 00:28:12.419 align:start position:0%
commands
 
00:28:14.289 --> 00:28:14.299 align:start position:0%
um at the time so I think it
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
could be that long okay great so so
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
excellent question so where did this
 
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
originate does this originate from this
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
doe this language
 
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
weren't sure no one knows
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you but Mario using that as
 
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
an example
 
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
and based upon your experience in
 
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
schools was that it was fifth grade the
 
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
thresholds for starting keyboarding Etc
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes and there was there was there was no
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
other uh they might have had a feed on
 
00:28:48.409 --> 00:28:48.419 align:start position:0%
it you know 10 minutes in class but the
 
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
people the class it was called computer
 
00:28:54.169 --> 00:28:54.179 align:start position:0%
literacy started in fifth grade so there
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
was no program for example in logo where
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
the kids were learning to do some minor
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
programming Etc well there might have
 
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
been absent the kids were able to get on
 
00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.059 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't a class you know what I
 
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
mean they could have during
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
uh Flex time or whatever done something
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
like that but in terms of an actual
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
course and that's pretty standard it was
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
um I think that's pretty yeah I think
 
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
fifth grade I was
 
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.070 align:start position:0%
fifth grade I was
but

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:24.299 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are assuming kids are
 
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
coming knowing how to do that stuff now
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
yeah you know they probably have kids in
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
the second grade to know more about
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
computers than I do
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's true but it might be what not
 
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
what we want them to know well that's
 
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:40.740 align:start position:0%
true too I think this is the fifth grade
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
was I mean it was a course it was it
 
00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
wasn't just keyboarding it was
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
um you know using office using Adobe
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
suite using using all these different
 
00:29:54.769 --> 00:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
programs to produce
 
00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
to produce not to play do you have some
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
homeschool students come in New York uh
 
00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:01.070 align:start position:0%
homeschool students come in New York uh
yes

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
so that would qualify then under this oh
 
00:30:03.419 --> 00:30:06.889 align:start position:0%
so that would qualify then under this oh
yeah

00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
Rick yeah another technical question on
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
this so at the top of
 
00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.490 align:start position:0%
this so at the top of
of

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.149 align:start position:0%
of
um

00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
um it says in this subdivision and that
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
starts out all the definitions
 
00:30:24.659 --> 00:30:25.549 align:start position:0%
starts out all the definitions
um

00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
is the subdivision is the subdivision 38
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
I think the smaller of the two
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
so if you follow 198.38
 
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
to its conclusion
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
everything else looks like it's been
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
yeah it's just been wiped out I didn't
 
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
another plug for the book
 
00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:11.370 align:start position:0%
another plug for the book
[Laughter]

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:11.380 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:20.230 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
[Music]

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
so 198.38 set the page of top of page or
 
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
yeah 753 okay and then you turn the page
 
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's definitions 38 198 38 and it starts
 
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
out in this subdivision
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
so these definitions only apply to this
 
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
subdivision whatever subdivision means
 
00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.039 align:start position:0%
and then you flip over and uh
 
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
198.38 pretty much ends on the bottom of
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
753 and then it has
 
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
notes of what's been hacked out of it
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
and I think 198.40 would probably
 
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know from my experience as an
 
00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
elementary school principle for years
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
and years and years
 
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
and in different states
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
I saw if you were talking about a course
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
like reading language arts
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes that can extend
 
00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:39.179 align:start position:0%
Beyond in the social studies
 
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
where you're doing a thematic reading
 
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
book maybe in conjunction with what
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
you're studying it's in in the social
 
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
study side but it's also written in in
 
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
the reading level of those that you're
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
trying to teach
 
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
um for in comprehension skills detailed
 
00:32:59.930 --> 00:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
skills are out are all taught so the
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
classes it's
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
classes are not like they are approved
 
00:33:06.769 --> 00:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
courses in the high school where they're
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
approved those 43 courses are approved
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
in the middle school you can take one of
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
those courses if it's offered in
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
advanced you know an advanced you know
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
you could take out for one down there
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
and your your sport recognizes that as
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
an approved course
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
but there's other courses which are done
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
in the junior high school where student
 
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
students move
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
they've moved to different teachers they
 
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
moved to and that's that's pretty common
 
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
and pretty typical
 
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
is it that common for an elementary kid
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
to move from their third grade class to
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
somewhere else other than for art or
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
music or PE
 
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
they get it all that's why an elementary
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
teacher is credentialed as a k6 K8
 
00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:00.059 align:start position:0%
Elementary teacher
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
they can teach it all
 
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
in the high school and and we hope it's
 
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
in the middle school too and we we had
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
those issues oftentimes before where our
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
Middle School teacher wasn't getting
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
credit for teaching the same course as
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
the kid in the high school the teacher
 
00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
in the high school because they're just
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
doing a different about teaching exactly
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
the same course they didn't get
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for that
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
so but dropping this down in the
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
elementary school I think we're opening
 
00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
it up to a disaster
 
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
of interpretation
 
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
of abuse
 
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.970 align:start position:0%
of abuse
uh

00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
I I I I really I I you know I could I
 
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
could tolerate what Katie mentioned by
 
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
talking to her boss or who's her
 
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.629 align:start position:0%
talking to her boss or who's her
superintendent

00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
um I I know who the boss is you're the
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
boss but
 
00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:51.500 align:start position:0%
um where it's you're specifically taking
 
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
that course in science
 
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
it rotated to that class you're taking
 
00:34:59.089 --> 00:34:59.099 align:start position:0%
the science course
 
00:35:01.609 --> 00:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
that's easily identified the school
 
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
should get a 0.15 for that because the
 
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
kids coming in taking in that the class
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
school is getting nothing
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
I concur but I I have a hard time
 
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
swallowing down to the grade school I
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
really do I think we got we're opening
 
00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
up Pandora's Box to
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
where's the start and stop is it going
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
to be all day long is that the one
 
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.650 align:start position:0%
to be all day long is that the one
course

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh what are you gonna do in kindergarten
 
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
when the primary thing everything I
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
learned in kindergarten is what I need
 
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
for life and here you have the
 
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
kindergarten teaching social skills in
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
every class and where's math start and
 
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
stop When you're counting blocks and
 
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.069 align:start position:0%
stop When you're counting blocks and
playing

00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
playing
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
all right so you're suggesting that a
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
school might only get credited for 0.15
 
00:35:45.849 --> 00:35:45.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
instructing a kid for a in a full-time
 
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.730 align:start position:0%
instructing a kid for a in a full-time
basis

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.370 align:start position:0%
basis
possible

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:51.380 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
that could be a course that could be you
 
00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
know that's why we have we had a
 
00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
definition everything is what does it
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
say in a course program or grade
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh we Define course and program
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
differently than we do grade we have
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
grade there simply because we got the
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
grade schools
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
and though that is the curriculum
 
00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
asking if I had concur or not concur
 
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
it's up to the instructional
 
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
organization of that school figure out
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
what's best to convey the curriculum in
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
the instruction
 
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.609 align:start position:0%
the instruction
um

00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
it's easy in the high school we're able
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
to do that to remember the school boards
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
Association testifying on behalf of that
 
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
saying this is easy to identify and it
 
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
should occur
 
00:36:37.609 --> 00:36:37.619 align:start position:0%
we had a discussion in the middle
 
00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
schools at that time because we didn't
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
have it really clearly defined but I
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
think you can at the middle school
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
whether it's grades seven and eight the
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
junior high school or six seven and
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
eight but remember middle schools also
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:56.569 --> 00:36:56.579 align:start position:0%
Glenn you look like you're back to
 
00:36:59.810 --> 00:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
um uh if I'm correct and I think you
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
pointed out Mr chairman that um it
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
currently is 9 to 12 in statute
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
um so if if you want to
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
um amend this to you know begin at grade
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
six or whatever
 
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
um and bypass the uh difficulties with
 
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
the class structure at the elementary
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
school level I I think that would still
 
00:37:32.329 --> 00:37:32.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
I take the word co-curricular out of
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
that because they
 
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
we started homeschooling it was up to
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
the school district whether to allow
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
home schoolers to be on their teams or
 
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.990 align:start position:0%
home schoolers to be on their teams or
not

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
and it does it's not an academic
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
program I think I think I agree with you
 
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
I don't think those rules are you're
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
right and that's set up by n h i a a
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
they require you've got to be in
 
00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:11.579 align:start position:0%
attendance a day prior to being in that
 
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
sport if you were missing that date
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
you're not going to play in that game
 
00:38:17.569 --> 00:38:17.579 align:start position:0%
and we've had state championships won
 
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
and lost that way uh but to
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
the issue of sports is I think taken
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
care of through that organization
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
and we do have kids coming in also and
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
that are homeschooled that are welcome
 
00:38:40.609 --> 00:38:40.619 align:start position:0%
to play
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
in the middle school or the grade school
 
00:38:42.599 --> 00:38:44.450 align:start position:0%
in the middle school or the grade school
activities

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
they're welcome and they are too but you
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
know I I I don't know why co-curricular
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
is in this well but co-click it can be
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
more than just Athletics
 
00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:56.300 align:start position:0%
I mean it could be the chess club
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
it could be theater theater band
 
00:39:05.569 --> 00:39:05.579 align:start position:0%
yeah math outside but is the is the is
 
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
the school would the school be getting
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
credit 0.15 credit for the co-curricular
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
have curricular stuff that's not part of
 
00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.050 align:start position:0%
have curricular stuff that's not part of
adequacy

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:20.420 align:start position:0%
that's extra that's why they call it
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
extracurricular you've been saying that
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
for some time and and some school
 
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
districts charge a fee for the students
 
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
participate in the extracurricular
 
00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.130 align:start position:0%
participate in the extracurricular
program

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
they boil it down for maybe eighty
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
dollars to high school down to twenty
 
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
five dollars twenty dollars they turn
 
00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:38.099 align:start position:0%
that around and that's where they get
 
00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:40.619 align:start position:0%
their stipend money for the instructor
 
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
or the coach
 
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
es money is not in adequacy the PE
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.089 --> 00:39:53.099 align:start position:0%
so so are we going to reimburse them
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
the 0.15 which is coming out of that
 
00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
adequacy area
 
00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:00.980 align:start position:0%
now we're going to have that funding
 
00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activities I think we've
 
00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:05.180 align:start position:0%
got to be careful
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
the coach's salaries are the same that
 
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
when I coach to get Pennies on the hour
 
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
so that's a big piece the big thing is
 
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
the fields the facility which would be I
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
don't know how the facility would fit
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
into it but the use of the facility the
 
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
equipment and the uniforms that's
 
00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.530 align:start position:0%
equipment and the uniforms that's
basically

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:26.540 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:30.740 align:start position:0%
uh the biggest cost I think for for
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
co-curricular extra curriculum that's
 
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
where you have to have a genius as a
 
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
principal figuring out how to write how
 
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
to do that right and a coach and the
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
athletic director that's their
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
baileywick and that's why you see kids
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
wearing old uniforms sometimes because
 
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
then they're not at that price yet and
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's why there's soda machines in the
 
00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:50.220 align:start position:0%
back hall that's why on my soda machine
 
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
in my elementary school which was about
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
500 kids I took annually from that
 
00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
machine eighteen thousand dollars
 
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
it's huge money and then if you're in
 
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
Texas and if you have a contract with
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
Pepsi you better not have any Coca-Cola
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
in that school that's right
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
nothing good
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
the teachers have been canned for that
 
00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:17.180 align:start position:0%
we tried to get no pun intended but uh
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
so what we're really talking about here
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
then the problems we've got with this
 
00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
is the elementary program
 
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
the co-curricular
 
00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:29.339 align:start position:0%
so if we were to move
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
if we were to move if we were to mend
 
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.510 align:start position:0%
if we were to move if we were to mend
this

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.250 align:start position:0%
this
to

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
that's you mentioned sixth grade to 12.
 
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
for curricular programs
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
would that then solve the kind of
 
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
conversation we've been having so
 
00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to reach you're moving
 
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
towards that goal I'm trying to just
 
00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:50.339 align:start position:0%
read some kind of conclusion here okay
 
00:41:52.329 --> 00:41:52.339 align:start position:0%
okay Lindy thank you
 
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
if we're looking at line
 
00:41:59.569 --> 00:41:59.579 align:start position:0%
three and House Bill 625
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
um and then compare that to the students
 
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
who are eligible to have access from
 
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
section 193 colon 1C which is referenced
 
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
here we could eliminate
 
00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:13.490 align:start position:0%
here we could eliminate
um

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
access to curricular and co-curricular
 
00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:17.579 align:start position:0%
we could just say eligible to have
 
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
access to
 
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:20.690 align:start position:0%
access to
um

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
public school programs per RSA 193 colon
 
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
1-c then we would
 
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't start getting into the weeds
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
over what's co-curricular
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
because it's already defined in 193.
 
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:47.099 align:start position:0%
the local school board shall adopt a
 
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
policy regulating participation in
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
curricular courses and co-curricular
 
00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.069 align:start position:0%
curricular courses and co-curricular
programs

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to redefine it
 
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.370 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to redefine it
necessarily

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
we can just reference
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
the other RSA
 
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
we don't know where this came from
 
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
we don't know where it came from but do
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
we have a specific problem like one can
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
can someone give an example of a school
 
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
or give an example of when or why it
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah did Glenn say that this was
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
the department had had people contact so
 
00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
I think that his father to happen to
 
00:43:47.569 --> 00:43:47.579 align:start position:0%
hearing from the Department
 
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
that there's that was concern but
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
what's the problem yeah
 
00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
and middle school isn't as as delineated
 
00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
as high school is I mean it you may be
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
able to kind of wheel out that they have
 
00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:05.579 align:start position:0%
a math class for the math teacher but
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
they set up in Pods at least over where
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
we are you know the groups that and they
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
may have Matt you know math integrated
 
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
with something else I mean it Middle
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
School is kind of all set up to be
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
Innovative and
 
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh interconnected rather than high
 
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
school where you take a chemistry class
 
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
and a physics class and you know math
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
class so I think Middle School is not as
 
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
delineated and as easy
 
00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
it would be a protagonal junior high
 
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
school the old Junior but uh I tend to
 
00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
agree on that but I think you could
 
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
it be worth investigating it if it's not
 
00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
six through twelve seven through twelve
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of k-6s buildings too
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
which are still in there all working
 
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps what we ought to do is is uh try
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
to find out a little bit more where this
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
came from
 
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
why it was put forth
 
00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.390 align:start position:0%
why it was put forth
uh

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
we had this discussion once before when
 
00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
it came to the Middle School
 
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
and we looked at language which
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
identified the 43 courses that we
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
required those have to be up those
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
courses have to be approved by the
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
school board
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
the course in the Middle School do not
 
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
so you can teach any which way you want
 
00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
most of them get in some form of block
 
00:45:37.859 --> 00:45:39.710 align:start position:0%
most of them get in some form of block
scheduling

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
scheduling
 
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.270 align:start position:0%
scheduling
so

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.490 align:start position:0%
so
Mario

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:42.500 align:start position:0%
Mario
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
well unless they're getting if it's in
 
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:47.339 align:start position:0%
middle school and they're getting high
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
school credit for it right was the other
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
issue that I brought up we have that we
 
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
have eighth graders taking the high
 
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
school court and it's got to be the same
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
as the high school course yeah they
 
00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
can't do whatever they want and I think
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's only fair that if they're if
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
they're teaching a course as the high
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
school teacher would teach it and
 
00:46:08.089 --> 00:46:08.099 align:start position:0%
people credentials and all that and
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
that's it's approved by that board for
 
00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
graduation there should be a
 
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of a 0.15 for that course
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
so Rick yeah um
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know I think it makes sense to get
 
00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
um to get some clarification on what the
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
problem what what what what uh
 
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
precipitated this
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
built to come in
 
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
um I think I would also like to get some
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
clarification on what it means at the um
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
at the top of what chapter you end 198
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
38 198 753 what it means when it says in
 
00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
this subdivision all these definitions
 
00:46:56.329 --> 00:46:56.339 align:start position:0%
whether that stays with 38 or whether
 
00:46:59.809 --> 00:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
that continues throughout all 198
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
um and I'm also interested in in the
 
00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:05.569 align:start position:0%
um and I'm also interested in in the
distinction

00:47:05.569 --> 00:47:05.579 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
in both you know both sections of this
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
why the public school is is referred to
 
00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
as a school board approved public school
 
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.270 align:start position:0%
as a school board approved public school
um

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
why is it a school board approved public
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.609 --> 00:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
what's that truck back here
 
00:47:28.619 --> 00:47:31.970 align:start position:0%
what's that truck back here
94.

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
because that's not the District of
 
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.030 align:start position:0%
because that's not the District of
residence

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
residence
 
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:36.500 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
193 colon 1C I think talks about the
 
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.710 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:56.700 align:start position:0%
I'd have to look through this thing a
 
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
I think we need a little more work on
 
00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.170 align:start position:0%
I think we need a little more work on
this

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
before we can do anything I think we got
 
00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
some marching orders here
 
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
so with contact Doe
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
try to get some more information
 
00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:16.619 align:start position:0%
regarding this in 198.38
 
00:48:16.619 --> 00:48:21.170 align:start position:0%
regarding this in 198.38
um

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
I saw somewhere in here where
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
the course has to be approved by the
 
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
local school board
 
00:48:32.089 --> 00:48:32.099 align:start position:0%
to be one of those 43 courses
 
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
I think that's in rule as well
 
00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.710 align:start position:0%
I think that's in rule as well
but

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
so let's let's not take any action at
 
00:48:40.849 --> 00:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
all now I didn't plan on taking the
 
00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
action anything here today
 
00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.230 align:start position:0%
action anything here today
um

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
is there anything else we need to do on
 
00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
this right here I think we need a little
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
bit more work and more information from
 
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.650 align:start position:0%
bit more work and more information from
Doe

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:56.339 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:59.089 --> 00:48:59.099 align:start position:0%
yes okay good okay what's the next one
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
we ought to take out 37 637.
 
00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
6 37
 
00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:15.410 align:start position:0%
6 37
yes

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:19.609 --> 00:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
okay this was a doe request I guess and
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
I also have a commitment that
 
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
you just say six three seven six three
 
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:39.170 align:start position:0%
you just say six three seven six three
seven

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
yeah there is a there is an amendment
 
00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.849 align:start position:0%
yeah there is a there is an amendment
difference

00:49:43.849 --> 00:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:58.670 align:start position:0%
 
h

00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.550 align:start position:0%
 
mm

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.589 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:10.190 align:start position:0%
there was
143.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
I've got two of them right here I can
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
give one away if somebody needs
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
I think I need the same class yeah it's
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
the same thing yeah it's exactly the
 
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
same clarification I'm reading it the
 
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
same way basically I I would I would
 
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
think of you
 
00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
if we get Caitlyn here or whomever
 
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
they can answer the questions regarding
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
both of these
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
because I've got the same question here
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
how to determine the elementary
 
00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.970 align:start position:0%
how to determine the elementary
curriculum

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
and then see this is applicable only
 
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
yep and I think it's got to be
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
applicable only to that student yeah
 
00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
not to an EFA too
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
so this one right here this amendment
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
would be easy for me to change just you
 
00:51:33.049 --> 00:51:33.059 align:start position:0%
know scratch a whole lot of stuff out of
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
not not in the amendment
 
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
if you look at B there it still has
 
00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
who was enrolled in a school board
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
it could be a high school course that
 
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
leads to graduation or something like
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
that a high school approved course in
 
00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.829 align:start position:0%

eight or seven through twelve
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
so then you're taking that approved
 
00:52:29.569 --> 00:52:29.579 align:start position:0%
course that's board approved for
 
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:32.280 align:start position:0%

that's the early ads for Algebra 1 you
 
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
other words we're only opening up still
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
to courses that are approved at high
 
00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:13.140 align:start position:0%
school at the high school level but
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
that goes along with competency
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
education a person's ready for that
 
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
should be doing that
 
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
not just until they get the high school
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
how does the current law prohibit that
 
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
from happening
 
00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:41.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.339 align:start position:0%
unless the definition of high school
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
specifically says 9 through 12 somewhere
 
00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:03.300 align:start position:0%
I've looked up that definition there
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
right but it but it's I I was I was I
 
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
sort of re reassessed how I was reading
 
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
um school board approved
 
00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
High School course it's a school board
 
00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
approved course and it can be a high
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't have to it doesn't mean
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
that the student has to be on grade
 
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.770 align:start position:0%
that the student has to be on grade
level

00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
I mean it's just the student is taking a
 
00:55:34.609 --> 00:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
high school board approved High School
 
00:55:34.619 --> 00:55:38.870 align:start position:0%
high school board approved High School
course

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
see they have under 193 E3 Dash f
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
approval of courses and programs
 
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
and it says the principal or other
 
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
administrator of a high school shall
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
Grant credit toward High School
 
00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:54.049 align:start position:0%
Grant credit toward High School
graduation

00:55:54.049 --> 00:55:54.059 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
for similar courses of programs have
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
been satisfied satisfactorily completed
 
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
at other public school approved schools
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
or shall provide reasonable
 
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
justification for denial
 
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:06.290 align:start position:0%
justification for denial
so

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
it goes on and talks about Vermont and
 
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
Maine and all of a sudden being in a
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
tuition School
 
00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
I would
 
00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
if they're going to get credit for
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
graduation I would think that the high
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
school principal would have to
 
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
approve that course that's being taught
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
in the eighth grade or at least the
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
school board would have to somebody
 
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.910 align:start position:0%
school board would have to somebody
wouldn't

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
that the well the school board approves
 
00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
it as as part of the program studies for
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
the high school
 
00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
right and we have kids that can graduate
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
from high school in three years time if
 
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
they're got it all done they're ready to
 
00:56:47.809 --> 00:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
go to college yeah we've I mean I think
 
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
everybody probably has something we have
 
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
some middle schoolers that are taking
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
High School courses yeah
 
00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:59.630 align:start position:0%
High School courses yeah
um

00:56:59.630 --> 00:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
well the two bills are the same they
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
really are I think it goes down to what
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
what what's what's what what what are we
 
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
trying to fix here yeah
 
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
would it be worth contacting a school
 
00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
administrators Association and finding
 
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:15.770 align:start position:0%
administrators Association and finding
out

00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
how this would be perceived by high
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
school principals I I think it's worth I
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
mean did did this
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
this came out of the department did this
 
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
bubble up through the department to
 
00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
Glenn and then I can't remember which
 
00:57:30.049 --> 00:57:30.059 align:start position:0%
one they're both almost the same
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
language representative Hudson said this
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
was from the Department yeah so so we
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
should find out what the complaint was
 
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
from the Department
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
we don't need names but
 
00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:53.809 align:start position:0%
we don't need names but
yeah

00:57:53.809 --> 00:57:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
yeah let's do that that goes on in that
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
thing I just read it says for purposes
 
00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
of this section approved schools include
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire Public Schools
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
this is 193
 
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
e colon 3
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
yep there's only one thing in that whole
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
thing that's just approval of the
 
00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:46.910 align:start position:0%
thing that's just approval of the
courses

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
we need to get some history on this one
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
we've never asked the department what
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
would happen if you have an eighth
 
00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:00.059 align:start position:0%
grader that's taking an approved course
 
00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
in the eighth grade towards graduation
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
could they get reimbursed for this the
 
00:59:04.799 --> 00:59:07.849 align:start position:0%
could they get reimbursed for this the
0.15

00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:10.140 align:start position:0%
the district would get the money not the
 
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
they're very similar the same thing
 
00:59:26.809 --> 00:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
that's why we have them under the same
 
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
committee yeah
 
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
okay what else do we have to do
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
okay what else do we have to do that's
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
it that's it that's it
 
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
could have cleared up outside too yeah
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
look at that yeah just in time
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.049 --> 00:59:51.059 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
okay let's close it down what we'll do
 
00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:54.299 align:start position:0%
is we'll come back after we get some of
 
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna call Caitlyn right now and ask
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
her that question about taking High
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
I don't know are they still in public
 
01:00:11.099 --> 01:00:26.170 align:start position:0%
I don't know are they still in public
