few announcements before we go to our
 
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
first hearing um we've all very sadly
 
00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
watched the no longer avalability of
 
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
Girl Scout cookies through
 
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative LC but there is good news
 
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh there is a
 
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
connection and it's on the fourth floor
 
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
and of course we want to go up to the
 
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
fourth floor front desk and buy some
 
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
Girl Scout cookies wouldn't you say so
 
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
we've fixed that problem the second ly
 
00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 align:start position:0%
for the uh minority if you are going to
 
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
be filing a Minority Report it has to be
 
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
in today this is something that we were
 
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
reminded of in uh chair's meeting just
 
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
now uh it goes on the Green Sheet the
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
statement of oh we're still thinking
 
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
about it can we be back to you in a few
 
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
days the answer is no if we do not have
 
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
the desire of a Minority Report and the
 
00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 align:start position:0%
person writing it by the time we leave
 
00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
today there will not be one the Green
 
00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
Sheet has to reflect
 
00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.149 align:start position:0%
Sheet has to reflect
it

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
um there will be no meeting of this
 
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
committee next Tuesday we were told as
 
00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
much as possible we should not be
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
meeting next Tuesday because it's town
 
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
meeting day and that affects many of us
 
00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 align:start position:0%
in various ways you will see on the
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
calendar there are a few committees that
 
00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 align:start position:0%
are meeting they have 6 or 70 or 80
 
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
bills they're dealing with so given the
 
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
choice of our meeting next week and
 
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
having 80 bills or are not meeting next
 
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
week and not having 80 bills I opted for
 
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
we're not meeting next
 
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
week our next committee committee
 
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
meeting will be in two weeks from today
 
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 align:start position:0%
March 18th and on the agenda of that
 
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
meeting will be everything that's on our
 
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
plate before crossover there will be
 
00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
hearings and executive sessions
 
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
on HB 518 requiring the commissioner of
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
of all costs incurred by
 
00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
DCF and there will be a hearing and
 
00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 align:start position:0%

00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
um I will be appointing uh a family
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
court subcommittee of this children and
 
00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
family law committee two years ago the
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House asked me to chair a
 
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
special committee on the Family Division
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
of Circuit Court four members were
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
appointed by me from this committee and
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
in consultation with me chairman Lynn of
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee appointed five
 
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
people from his committee we took 12
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
hours of oral testimony received volumes
 
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
of written communication and had
 
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
numerous meetings of the committee and
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittees because many individuals
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
hold a highly negative view of our
 
00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:04.519 align:start position:0%
courts I wanted to assure our Judicial
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
System leaders that in general the way I
 
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:11.240 align:start position:0%
address issues is collaboratively not
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
confrontationally and would act that way
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
with them that is to say unless or until
 
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
I am convinced otherwise I would be of
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
the belief that our judicial leaders
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
come to work each day to do the best
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
they can and to be fair and to be
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
hopeful of course there is the
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
occasional bad judge just as the
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
occasional bad apple is to be found in
 
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.910 align:start position:0%
occasional bad apple is to be found in
every

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
profession but my offer to the judicial
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
leaders that I wish my special committee
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
to gang up with them against
 
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
problems and not to gang up against them
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
they were of the same opinion our two
 
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
years of work proved this to be true we
 
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
started with lwh hanging fruit several
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
items that were easy to work on on while
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
they were not major systemic issues they
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
were hardly
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
Band-Aids the special committee honored
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
their knowledge of working in the field
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
every day while they honored our
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
position as people approaching things
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
with outside pairs of eyes good work was
 
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
done but we knew there was much more to
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
do with a level of mutual trust having
 
00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
been established My Hope was that the
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
speaker would reauthor authorized the
 
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
special committee for two more years so
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
we could focus on tougher issues several
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
of us saw three issues among others
 
00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
number one was the level of ability of
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
counseling speaking only for myself
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
having spent 50 years giving pastoral
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
counseling I got the impression that the
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
quality of pre-trial counseling could be
 
00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:59.350 align:start position:0%
quality of pre-trial counseling could be
improved

00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
improved
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
secondly we noted the wide variety from
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
court to court of what would and what
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
would not be admitted as evidence it is
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
a stated policy that the Rules of
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
Evidence in Family discre Family
 
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
Division are at the total discretion of
 
00:11:16.829 --> 00:11:16.839 align:start position:0%
the judge because the superior court
 
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
operates on a different principle the
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
quick answer might be to move everything
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
from the Family Division there but we
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
are aware of other issues that would
 
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
then come into play therefore for
 
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
further work considerable further work
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
is needed and then three issues of
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and how they are
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
treated by the Family Division need
 
00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
scrutiny we noted a lack of
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
communication between the Court's
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
hearing a case of such violence and with
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
a different court hearing matters of
 
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
divorce and custody with these matters
 
00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
still outstanding some monks ago I asked
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
the special the speaker to give the
 
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
special committee two more years
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
since the conclusion of our special
 
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
committee's first two years last October
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
other state representatives have weighed
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
in on these matters some with bills of
 
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.150 align:start position:0%
in on these matters some with bills of
their

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
own speaker response instead was to
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
suggest iform a subcommittee out of this
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee that
 
00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:23.639 align:start position:0%

00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
difficult issues
 
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.519 align:start position:0%

neglect for certain health care
 
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
providers as a condition for lure and
 
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you chairman and committee
 
00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Alicia Greg I
 
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
represent nasua in Ward 7 specifically
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to be doing this uh for
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative grman today in herstead
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
since she cannot be here with us um she
 
00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
does send her regards to everyone this
 
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
bill is similar to one that we looked at
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
last year uh what this is doing is and
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
by the way we have a lot of different
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
bills I think partly because of the
 
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
special committee we worked on and
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
because of the intense work that we have
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
done in the last two years really kind
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
of tackling um our biggest problems all
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
in in different directions and this is
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
actually part of that so what this does
 
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
is this is talking about training um for
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
lure for Physicians and it's specific
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
and also for nurse practitioners and
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistants this is spe
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
specific to child abuse and neglect so
 
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
training um you know this is important
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
and I do have an amendment too that um
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
changes it from two hours of Education
 
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
to one hour of Education um I think we
 
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
can all agree that one hour is uh goes
 
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly so it's not a lot of time
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
but it's enough I think it's important
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
that we are educating people who see
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
this the most um not not only so that
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
they can understand what child abuse is
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
but also what child abuse is not um you
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
know we have heard a lot in hear not
 
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
only about uh child abuse cases getting
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
missed we also hear about um maybe
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
people being accused of child abuse that
 
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's not so I think that the only way we
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
can really prevent both of those and
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
help both of those is to really educate
 
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
I know other states even have
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
requirements believe it or not for um
 
00:15:58.509 --> 00:15:58.519 align:start position:0%
beauticians for estheticians because
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
they're likely to have somebody in their
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
chair I can't imagine somebody more apt
 
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
to see abuse than any of these
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
professions so we do have um some people
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
willing to testify I also would like you
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
to look Dr Roy um said could not be here
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
she said that she was going to submit
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
some testimony but um there are other
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
people that can talk more to the
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
specifics but I can answer any questions
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
that you might have
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
maybe any questions for the
 
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.949 align:start position:0%
maybe any questions for the
representative

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
representative marel yes thank you for
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
taking my question a little closer to
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
the mic please I'm sorry okay is that
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
better okay thanks closer okay u a
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
question okay with the hour that you've
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned now is this going to be one
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
hour to complete the requirement or is
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
this going to be an ongoing 1 hour each
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
reporting period so this is like many
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
other uh we see in medical professions
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
with new training continuing education
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
this is going to be for new lure or
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
continued lure so not every year but
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
certainly when you need to renew your
 
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
license okay but okay so if I'm hear
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
followup oh I'm sorry followup thank you
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um so would this be one hour
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
one and done and that's it or every year
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
well not every year if you have
 
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
continued Li when you get your license
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
when you have that renewal then that's
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
what it looks like to me that it would
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
be an extra another hour chair has a
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
since I'm married to a physician and
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
since I'm part-time CEO of a medical
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
organization uh this does pop up
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
periodically called continuing education
 
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
would this be one of the hours that this
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
professional would be um required to do
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
in that reup year or would this be on
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
top of I'm going to defer that question
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure and I want to make
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
sure you have accurate information thank
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
Association good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ben Bradley I
 
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
represent all of the state's 26 acute
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
care hospitals and Specialty hospitals
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire through the New

Hampshire Hospital
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
Association uh um hospitals and our
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
providers do take their obligation to
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
report any suspicion of child abuse or
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
neglect very seriously New Hampshire Law
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
requires any person who suspects that a
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
child under the age of 18 has been
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
report that suspicion immediately to DCF
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
169-d colon 29 through
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
31 we agree that healthcare providers
 
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
are in a unique position to identify
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
children who have been abused or
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
neglected and support and promote the
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
programs that our members and others
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
offer to help educate providers on
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
reporting child abuse and
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
neglect however we do not believe the
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
education requirements proposed in HP
 
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:19.640 align:start position:0%
493 should be legislated healthc Care
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
Professionals already have a duty to
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
report as part of their professional
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
obligations to follow state and federal
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
regulations which includes many other
 
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
requirements ments such as their duty to
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
report elder abuse dog bites and
 
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.070 align:start position:0%
report elder abuse dog bites and
communicable

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
communicable
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
diseases singling out one type of
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
required training for mandatory
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
reporting seems to create
 
00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies that inserts the
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
legislature and educational mandates
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
that do not exist anywhere else in
 
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
statute historically the legislature has
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
passed educational requirements for
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
opioid prescribing several years ago
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
however those statutory requirements
 
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
have since been repealed and left to the
 
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine to
 
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
determine uh for these reasons the
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
hospital Association is resp
 
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
respectfully unable to support this bill
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
um I do want to thank you for the
 
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share our feedback I also
 
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
want to thank the proponents of this
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill because we have worked with them in
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
the past on raising awareness about the
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities that um they
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
support um particularly the office of
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
child advocate which does an incredible
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
job for the children in New Hampshire um
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
we have worked collaboratively with the
 
00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:35.559 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill and welcomed
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
them to our chief nursing officer
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
professional peer group to share their
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the importance of child
 
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect reporting
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
training um and that information was
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
very well received by our members so I'm
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
happy to take you questions from the
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
committee Mr Bradley would it be your
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
many of the providers in the hospital
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
system are really ignorant of the signs
 
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
of abuse and neglect that they really
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
have never been much taught this and
 
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
that no one else in the facility would
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
catch it either unless this bill were to
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
pass uh I can't speak to that Mr
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
chairman that's not my sense um I think
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
our members do provide training to uh
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
the profession that are outlined in this
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill we've also as I mentioned welcomed
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh those proponents of this bill to our
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
peer groups through the hospital
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
Association to share uh the resources
 
00:21:42.909 --> 00:21:42.919 align:start position:0%
that they're promoting um to try to get
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
our members to adopt that which I think
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
that information as I've mentioned was
 
00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:48.070 align:start position:0%
that information as I've mentioned was
well

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
received any questions from Mr
 
00:21:54.909 --> 00:21:54.919 align:start position:0%
Bradley representative Raymond thank you
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you Mr Bradley for
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
taking my question so this is the second
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
time that this bill has come up in the
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
last couple of years and last time the
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
discussion was about um not training how
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
to call or when to call it's not
 
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
mandated report training it's training
 
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
about how to recognize the signs and
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
symptoms of abuse in the two years since
 
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
the last time this bill has come up has
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
the hospital Association adopted
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
voluntarily any additional signs of
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
child abuse and Mal treatment training
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
for their staff
 
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
well first I would just say um yes I
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that this bill has come up
 
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.909 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that this bill has come up
before

00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
um as far as our training um our members
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
do provide annual training to their to
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
their staff on child abuse and neglect
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
identifying and Reporting both of those
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh and as I've mentioned we've welcomed
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
the proponents of this bill to join with
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
the professional peer groups that we
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
host including Chief nursing officers at
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
our member facilities to share the
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
resources that they're promoting it's
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
not a question of whether training is
 
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate or whether they should be
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
aware of the importance of that training
 
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
or how to train or how to report we
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
believe that is very important which our
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
members do stand behind it's the
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
question of whether to put something in
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
statute that doesn't exist for anything
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
else for example would you promote
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
training and Reporting on on human
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
trafficking would you promote training
 
00:23:36.909 --> 00:23:36.919 align:start position:0%
and Reporting on um elderly abuse other
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
things that are an expectation of the
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
providers that work within our system
 
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
and so we do believe that those are
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
important trainings it's just a question
 
00:23:49.149 --> 00:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
of whether to mandate it through
 
00:23:49.159 --> 00:23:52.269 align:start position:0%
of whether to mandate it through
legislative

00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
statute representative
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
Pell thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm am Vaguely
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
Familiar with the requirements of um
 
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
physician continuing medical education
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
training because I actually help keep
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
track of my own husband's training and I
 
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:11.799 align:start position:0%
know that they're required to complete
 
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
100 hours of continuing education every
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
two years and it would be my assumption
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
that any physician who was taking care
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
of um children or minors under the age
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
of 18 would probably be already alerted
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
for U or on the alert of child abuse and
 
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
neglect I mean if anybody who's taken
 
00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
their child to a pediatrician knows that
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
their asked questions their child being
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
examined um they might even ask the
 
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
parents to leave the room so I I'm
 
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
personally find this to be a little bit
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
of overstep and an um a bit of an
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
undermining of physicians's Professional
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
Standards um would you be in agreement
 
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
with that um I would just e Echo was
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
that a would you believe it is kind of a
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
would you believe yes just say for the
 
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
record would you believe everything
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
said um I would just Echo what I've my
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
reflect in my testimony thank
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
you okay Mr Bradley um in the unlikely
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
event uh a professional at one of the
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
hospitals you represent should
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
miss this sign as it's unlikely with any
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
other thing that occasionally is missed
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
would there not be other team members
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
who would catch it I I don't think there
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
are any guarantees um whether you've
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
taken the training or not uh I think our
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
professionals make every effort to um
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
you know support their patients I think
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
they act in good faith um and I you know
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
am just here to try to represent their
 
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:53.799 align:start position:0%
voice as uh folks who come to work every
 
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
day and do their best in a very
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
challenging environment my followup to
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
that is is it unlikely that if somebody
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
is admitted to one of your the hospitals
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
you represent that person would be seen
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
by one Medical Professional only and no
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
other staff um respectfully Mr chairman
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that I could
 
00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
speak hypothetically uh from you know my
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
experience and uh going to a doctor um
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
there are typically at least a couple of
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
folks who will visit on a visit okay any
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
other question questions for Mr
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
Bradley seeing none thank you for your
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and I neglected to mention
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
this at the beginning couple things for
 
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%

advocate welcome
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
back good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and for the
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
record my name is Cassandra Sanchez I am
 
00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:23.799 align:start position:0%
the child advocate for the State of New
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am here this morning in
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 493 um as well as
 
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was presented this
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
morning um so I'm going to start by
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
laying some groundwork as to how the
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
office the child advocate became
 
00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
invested in this training um in the in
 
00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.590 align:start position:0%
invested in this training um in the in
early

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
early
 
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
2020 we identified nine cases of
 
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
non-ambulatory infants that presented to
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
emergency departments with multiple
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
broken bones um in that time
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
frame thankfully none of those children
 
00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
passed um but there were a large number
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
of them that had seen multiple doctors
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
before getting to the point of getting
 
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
the appropriate medical attention that
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
alerted that the cause of the injuries
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
were ultimately um result of abuse or
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
neglect we ultimately decided because
 
00:28:14.909 --> 00:28:14.919 align:start position:0%
there were such a large number of those
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
in a short period of time and we're
 
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
talking about infants that can't speak
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
up for themselves that it was really
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
critical for us to take a look at this
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
issue and try to identify some gaps that
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
led us us there in August of 2023 the
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
OCA host did a system review mapping
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
which allows us to look at the larger
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
system issues and try to identify areas
 
00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:35.519 align:start position:0%
of growth during that System review
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
mapping we had members of law
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement medical professionals um
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
specifically medical professionals that
 
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
had an expertise in ch AB child abuse
 
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
and neglect cases um including the the
 
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
cap doctor for the
 
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
state um and we also had present at that
 
00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:54.919 align:start position:0%
uh mapping members of the department for
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
children youth and families and um
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
additional members of the community that
 
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
Pro they have um they Pro provide
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
services to families um during that
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
mapping one of the identified gaps was
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
trainings for doctors because we were
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
talking about some cases that included a
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
child presenting to the emergency
 
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
department first and an emergency doctor
 
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
not noting it as abuse or neglect and
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
having to be seen by a second level
 
00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:23.519 align:start position:0%
doctor for that finding to occur we
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
recognized that there were some misses
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
at the emergency department level as
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
well as one of these was seen by their
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
pediatrician initially um and wasn't
 
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
brought back to the Ed until days later
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
when they continued with fussiness in
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
the home those were misses um those
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
children returned back to that family
 
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
environment until they were seen by
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
another professional and so in talking
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
with these professionals we said what
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
can we do to ensure these misses do not
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
continue again these were just
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
non-ambulatory infants this doesn't mean
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
that there other weren't other misses
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
that were happening with older children
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
maybe toddlers who were mobile and would
 
00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
present to an ed with bruising and there
 
00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:02.919 align:start position:0%
are areas of abnormal bruising there are
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
areas of normal bruising for toddlers
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
especially when they're mobile moving
 
00:30:08.669 --> 00:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
around um so how many more misses were
 
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
out there we do not know and we don't
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
have a way to gather that information
 
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
but what we know is that we do not want
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
to continue to move in that direction we
 
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
want to ensure appropriate education to
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
keep that from happening in the future
 
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
so we met with and and and joined in the
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
efforts with the bill last session which
 
00:30:27.149 --> 00:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
did not move forward um then over last
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
summer so summer 2024 we created a
 
00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:33.519 align:start position:0%
presentation myself along with with the
 
00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:36.039 align:start position:0%
medical doctors about what we observed
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
about the cases that the OCA observed
 
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
about additional cases that they have
 
00:30:43.149 --> 00:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
observed including pictures of injuries
 
00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:44.919 align:start position:0%
that were presented to emergency
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
departments or other doctors before they
 
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
made their way to a professional in
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
child abuse and it shows the extensive
 
00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:54.519 align:start position:0%
amount of visits that occurred for some
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
children some of which are now left with
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
lifelong injuries and lifelong
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities because of what occurred to
 
00:31:02.909 --> 00:31:02.919 align:start position:0%
them what occurred for them early in
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
their lives and because medical
 
00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
treatment was not sought right away and
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
they were not placed in a safer
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
environment and continue
 
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:11.799 align:start position:0%
to get additional abuse within the home
 
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
that they resided so we worked together
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
to present that um those were presented
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
to multiple boards and professional
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
associations all of which I will say I
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't believe there was one person in
 
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
any of those rooms without their jaw
 
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
wide open when they received this
 
00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
presentation and learned what some of
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
the children in our state had
 
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
experienced and many felt very strongly
 
00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
that this was an appropriate ask it is
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
not addition to the hours that they
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
already have it is taking one of the
 
00:31:38.909 --> 00:31:38.919 align:start position:0%
hours that they are required for
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
training to be allotted for the child
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect training it was the
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
intention of this training is to ensure
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
that they are seeking out the signs and
 
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:50.919 align:start position:0%
the symptoms of abuse and are referring
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
to the appropriate entities to further
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
investigate such as the cap team such as
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
our child advocacy centers for
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
interviews if it is older children
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the appropriate
 
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
professionals are involved to provide
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
that more in-depth
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
review um the course was completed it is
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
an online course um it was it's
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
initially a two-hour course it was
 
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
presented it's been out there and
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
available for 5 months now in that five
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
Monon period 59 professionals from the
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
target population so that's um
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
Physicians U Physicians assistants aprns
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
59 um have taken it on their own that is
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
not representation of the professionals
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
across the state um so allowing it on a
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis is not bringing in the
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
amount of completion that we would hope
 
00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
for at this point um RN have voluntarily
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
signed up for the course and there are
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
87 RNs that have completed the course um
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
up to this point so we actually have
 
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
more nurses that have completed it than
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
the medical professionals that we are
 
00:32:55.389 --> 00:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
seeking to have complete this course um
 
00:32:58.629 --> 00:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
so at this point from my perspective and
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
the work that we've done in the office
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
as well as as what I've learned from the
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
medical professionals some of which
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
we'll speak today is that this Gap
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
remains and this is a real critical gap
 
00:33:09.629 --> 00:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
for us to close it is not a large ask
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
they are already conducting this
 
00:33:12.669 --> 00:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
training to make sure that one hour is
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
allotted to abuse or neglect can protect
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
far more children than the amount of
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
hours that it's going to take away from
 
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
our physicians I am open to any
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
questions I heard you say that this is
 
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
not additional time but it is part of
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
their hours I do not see that reflected
 
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
in either the bill or the amendment so
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass the bill or the bill
 
00:33:34.639 --> 00:33:35.909 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass the bill or the bill
is

00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
amended uh your statement is
 
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
aspirational but it's not a requirement
 
00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
it could be added on it just doesn't
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
say thank you for that comment I um had
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
some in-depth conversations with the
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
folks that developed it and I know that
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
was their intention behind it so that
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking on that was their intent of
 
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward was to have
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
it be one of the already allotted hours
 
00:33:59.070 --> 00:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
for trading uh this bill is scheduled to
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
be exact and I could execute right after
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
this hearing I must exec it later this
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon I am going to defer until
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
later this afternoon to see if an
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
amendment could be brought forth that
 
00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
would put into law if the bill passes
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
what you mentioned because uh I think
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful for some of us who
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
watch their spouses have to do a 100
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
hours every other year um any other
 
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
questions for uh uh Miss Sanchez yes
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
representative love thank you Mr
 
00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
question uh you mentioned the the
 
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
voluntary course was a two-hour course
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
do you think we might be skimping a
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
little bit by knocking it down to one
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
hour with the um with the amendment I'd
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
rather I'd rather have 15 minutes left
 
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
over people twiddling their thumbs and
 
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
than missing anything I will defer to
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
the doctors to answer that question for
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
you but my understanding and the way it
 
00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:55.079 align:start position:0%
was explained to me is that um in
 
00:34:57.069 --> 00:34:57.079 align:start position:0%
parsing it down the core critical
 
00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
information was still included and they
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
felt that it was still substantial
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
enough but I will let them further
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
answer that thank you thank
 
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I do know uh
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
that and many of us know that you had
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
come from Massachusetts Massachusetts
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
does have this requirement in
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
statute um have you seen had you while
 
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
you were in Massachusetts doing your job
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
there uh seen any difficulty andic
 
00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
professionals uh fulfilling this
 
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
requirement I did not see any difficult
 
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
difficulty with medical professionals
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
fulfilling that requirement um and I I
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
saw some wonderful relationships with um
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
local hospitals and pediatricians with
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
the child welfare agency and ensuring
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
that they had really open communication
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
and an understanding of um each each
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
other's roles and signs to look out for
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
follow up to her question were were
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
these uh was this continuing education
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
unit mandated by by law or was it done
 
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
by the professional agencies it is
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
mandated by law by law thank you any
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Pell yes
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I will try to
 
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
ask a real question this time um my
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
question Massachusetts does have a lot
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
of exceptional requirements for
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
Physicians so much so that the license
 
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
is almost burdensome to maintain um my
 
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
question is regarding the actual section
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
of law do you think this would be better
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
under 3296 G where they see it
 
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
continuing Med medical education is
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
required for Physicians rather than in
 
00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.829 align:start position:0%
required for Physicians rather than in
um

00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
169c I could not tell you which I
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
believe would be the better fit I just
 
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
think it's critical that we do have it
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
in our state laws
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
here representative love thank you Mr
 
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
question again do you know if DC DCF
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
investigators are required to take a
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
course like this DCF investigators have
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
extensive amount of training that they
 
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
have to take um they have training when
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
they're on boarding as well as extensive
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
ongoing training um some of that is
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
offered to them by medical professionals
 
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
they um contract with the cap program
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
and um the doctors there and so they
 
00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:16.599 align:start position:0%
have regular information sharing between
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
them um they have offered trainings um
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
extensive not in this sense because this
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
is more focused to medical professionals
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
but um in more coming from a a
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
psychology um Social Work standpoint
 
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
ensuring that they do know signs and
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
symptoms to look out for that they do
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
know um when certain disclosures are
 
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
made by children that they have to reach
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
out to certain entities they also um
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
work very closely with our child
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
advocacy centers the cac's here um in
 
00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and they also offer um
 
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
specialized training to dcyf staff so
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
they have a lot um and and much more
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
hours than um what we're asking here for
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you so
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony the chair
 
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
recognizes Dr Michael Matos from
 
00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.030 align:start position:0%
recognizes Dr Michael Matos from
wolfboro

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
wolfboro
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics and he has written testimony
 
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh apparently not enough for the
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
here all right thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
committee members I am Mike Matos I am a
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
general pediatrician wolf bro
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics and I'm here today in support
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill and I have three points that
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
I wanted to bring forward to the
 
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
committee first of all I think that
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
Physicians of all Specialties who treat
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
pediatric patients need this kind of
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
child abuse
 
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
training as part of my job at my
 
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
hospital I do receive a lot of the
 
00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
emergency room notes for patients who
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
are seen as PE as uh as children even
 
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
for those patients who I don't
 
00:38:58.109 --> 00:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
personally see in my practice
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
and one such note came through recently
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
which is representative of my concern so
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
a 7-year-old boy presented to the
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
Emergency Department emergency
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
department with his father for complaint
 
00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:07.829 align:start position:0%
department with his father for complaint
of

00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
headache and the reason he had a
 
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
headache was because that day his
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
stepfather had hit him several times in
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
the head in
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
Anger the emergency department physician
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
appropriately noted all the physical
 
00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
findings noted that the child had a neur
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
normal neurological exam but at the end
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
of the note it just said this patient
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
does not have a
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
concussion there was no discussion about
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not that patient needed to be
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
safely placed with his father until the
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
safety in the presence of The Stepfather
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
could be verified and there was no
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
mention of DCF being contacted and to
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
answer your earlier question about other
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
team members no one from the team that
 
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
DCF so that brings me to my second point
 
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
which is nobody goes to work and says I
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
want to do a bad
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
job there's a saying that learned
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
medicine that says you don't rise to the
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
training that lack of training prevents
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of Physicians from wanting to be
 
00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
involved with one of these cases they
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
hand it off as soon as they possibly can
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to make an
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
error they don't want to do something
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
that harms the child and they don't want
 
00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
to do something that might perhaps um
 
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
interfere with prosecution of a
 
00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.670 align:start position:0%
interfere with prosecution of a
perpetrator

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
so needing that training brings me to my
 
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
third point which is the proposed
 
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
coursework burden which is intended to
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
be part of that 100 hours by the way
 
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
it's not excessive so about 10 years ago
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire required that all
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
Physicians do the three hours of
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
training every two years learning about
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
pain medication and opioid addiction
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
treatment that year I signed up very
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
quickly because I wanted to satisfy that
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
need in my community and I treated two
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
patients who were in their 20s uh who
 
00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
did have opioid
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
addiction they age out of my practice
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
since then I haven't had a c single
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
patient who has needed treatment for
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
opio addiction but I continue to do my
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
hours of training every two years
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
because that was what was required for
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
lure in order for me to do a good
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
job I'll just finish by saying that
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
Physicians do a lot of training and
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
travel to conferences to do one hour of
 
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
training for things that they might see
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
once in their career or for things that
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
are one in a million child abuse is very
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
common and it's something that whether
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
they know it or not Physicians are
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
running into on a regular basis if they
 
00:41:41.079 --> 00:41:44.270 align:start position:0%
running into on a regular basis if they
treat

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
children with one hour of training I
 
00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.829 align:start position:0%
children with one hour of training I
expect

00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
expect
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
that Physicians will be shown how to
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
recognize child abuse how to triage it
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
to the appropriate uh agencies that will
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
help them
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
and that's what we really need in place
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why I support the bill I'll
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
take any other questions any questions
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
for Dr Matos representative
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
love thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question in your professional
 
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
enough um again I think child abuse is
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
very common it's fairly complex that's
 
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
why there are child abuse
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
experts um but I think
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
again giving Physicians the tools saying
 
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
this is what child abuse looks like and
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
this is what you should do when you run
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
into a case like this that's again
 
00:42:39.069 --> 00:42:39.079 align:start position:0%
giving them the tools to do these things
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
will make
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
them more assured when they meet a
 
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
patient who might have some child abuse
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to bury it under the
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
rug and maybe dish it off to someone
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question it's kind of
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
a two part
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
question do you believe that
 
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
um most Physicians and medical staff are
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
aware that they are mandated reporters
 
00:43:14.549 --> 00:43:14.559 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they don't always
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
rushed um
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
so I I've taken the course part part of
 
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:29.720 align:start position:0%
the course explains just what you asked
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
that everyone in New Hampshire is a
 
00:43:31.359 --> 00:43:32.349 align:start position:0%
that everyone in New Hampshire is a
mandated

00:43:32.349 --> 00:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
reporter um we actually after this case
 
00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
came through my uh through my hospital
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
we reminded everyone that this we are
 
00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:42.559 align:start position:0%
all uh mandated
 
00:43:42.559 --> 00:43:46.270 align:start position:0%
all uh mandated
reporters

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
um I I part of the um the training deals
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
with the actual reporting and I
 
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
think like I said that's part of the
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
toolbox that people need in order to
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.549 --> 00:44:04.559 align:start position:0%
cases followup or second question second
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
part of the question follow up to the
 
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.910 align:start position:0%
part of the question follow up to the
first

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
you again do you believe that this
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
training will uh remind more often that
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
these mandated reporters shall report
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
suspected abuse and neglect rather than
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
feel Rush
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
patient well I I don't think the rushing
 
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
is part of it like I said earlier I
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
think it's the discomfort with wanting
 
00:44:47.069 --> 00:44:47.079 align:start position:0%
to do the wrong thing not complete the
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
note in such a way that it's going to
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
support the child that's what I see more
 
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
often than I I was too busy to report it
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
um and the interesting thing is The
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
Physician who sees the patient doesn't
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
have to be the one to do the report that
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
can go to another member of the team so
 
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
it isn't necessarily a burden and again
 
00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
the course uh as I saw it went through
 
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
how to do a report and I think that's
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
very helpful for Physicians to
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
know thank you second
 
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
question you're all
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
said you're welcome representative
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
coren thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
for answering my question um from
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
listening to the story about the
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
seven-year-old who came in it sounds
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
like that physician didn't necessarily
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
need an education on the signs and
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
symptoms but on his responsibility as a
 
00:45:44.319 --> 00:45:46.790 align:start position:0%
symptoms but on his responsibility as a
physician

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
physician
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
um if I may follow up to that
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
um is there any accountability to
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
Physicians who just don't want to report
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
it because they don't want to get
 
00:45:56.599 --> 00:45:58.549 align:start position:0%
it because they don't want to get
involved

00:45:58.549 --> 00:45:58.559 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
because they're putting a child at risk
 
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes that that is um part of a law
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
that exists I believe um and part of the
 
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
reporting law says that you are not um
 
00:46:16.349 --> 00:46:16.359 align:start position:0%
responsible um for mistakenly making a
 
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
report and so yes that that was part of
 
00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
the training to explain that sort of
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
subtlety but I agree you want com you
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
want Physicians to feel comfortable
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
doing the reports
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
and as you said it was clear from the
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
note that the physician recognized what
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
the situation was but just didn't take
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
that next step didn't realize that you
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
really do have to contact DF in those
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
cases it seems
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
obvious um but a lot of these things do
 
00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.910 align:start position:0%
obvious um but a lot of these things do
in

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
retrospect representative grund thank
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
my question uh is the Assumption of
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
training being done the same as the
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
requirement in knowing is getting done
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
and the reason I'm asking is Can it can
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
you believe that pediatric doctors
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
nurses Pas LPN are probably receiving
 
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
training considering they work with
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
children but emergency room doctors
 
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
urgent care doctors maybe just general
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
not yeah exactly so um you do have that
 
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
100 hours where you can choose what you
 
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
study um I think that as I said we study
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of things as Physicians that we
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
may not see in our in our practice at
 
00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
all and there there's one in a million
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
things and yet we know exactly how to do
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
that work up and
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
and treat that patient and yet child
 
00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
abuse is so much more common and um so I
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
think it's very reasonable to say this
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
should be part of your biannual training
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
um to understand the subject and it's
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
not an
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
in-depth understanding you don't have to
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
deal with those subtle cases where is it
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
is it abuse or is it not it's that's you
 
00:48:02.109 --> 00:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
at least have to know how to get the
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
material seeing no further questions
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%

please Mr chairman members of the
 
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for letting me speak
 
00:48:39.069 --> 00:48:39.079 align:start position:0%
today my name is gwendelyn Gladstone I
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
am a retired child abuse
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
pediatrician um and I'm here to help
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
explain to you why we need to have this
 
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
bill what's different about educating
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
providers about child abuse and neglect
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
is that many of us haven't had very
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive training and therefore
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
when kids come in with minor signs or
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
symptoms that they're being mistreated
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
that can be missed and the child
 
00:49:10.109 --> 00:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
returned to an environment where they're
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
further injured that of course is a
 
00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
travesty it's also not acceptable if a
 
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
child is mistakenly thought to have been
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
abused but in fact has some other
 
00:49:24.789 --> 00:49:24.799 align:start position:0%
medical condition and an investigation
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
is done of the family and maybe even and
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
the child is placed outside of the
 
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
family as part of an evaluation we don't
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
want that to happen either um you might
 
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
be surprised to hear that when children
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
are referred to a child abuse specialist
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
because of concerns of abuse that abuse
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
is actually diagnosed less than half the
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
time so a lot of the reason to improve
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
the education for our providers is to be
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
sure we're calling it right calling the
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
abuse when it's there and not
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
overcalling it when it's not there in
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
addition Dr Matos has talked about the
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
impact of providers wanting to do the
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
right thing so what's different here
 
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
about child abuse from any other medical
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
topic that we don't have laws requiring
 
00:50:15.069 --> 00:50:15.079 align:start position:0%
education the difference is the number
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
of cases that we see in the field of
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
children who are missed and who are not
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
reported um and because of the long-term
 
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
effects on even one child the cost of
 
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
one brain damaged child from Abus of
 
00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
head trauma is in the order of millions
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
of dollars so we can't we just can't
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
have that um many states have have
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
adopted requirements for this as a
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
condition for lure and almost always
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
it's because there was some incredibly
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
terrible public catastrophe um so for
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
example in New York they made this a
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
they made a requirement for education on
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
these topics when a six-year-old was
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
severely neglected raped and murdered um
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania passed its law which is
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
three hours for lure and two hours to
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
renew after the sanduski affair um Maine
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
has a requirement because of a child who
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
died who presented multiple times with
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
signs of abuse and it was not there was
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
no intervention done so because the case
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing that's why we need to
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
do this um you mention
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
providers need to have need to know they
 
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
have to report they do know they have to
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
report but they don't and the reasons
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
are they're not sure they don't know how
 
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
to answer the question of is this abuse
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
or not they don't know where to go for
 
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
help they don't know how to do an
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
evaluation to look for other signs
 
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
hidden signs um they don't want to get
 
00:51:50.309 --> 00:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
involved because they don't know how to
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
talk to a family about their concerns
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
about abuse and neglect these are all
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
topics that are covered in the toour
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
course that we have available and which
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
as Miss Sanchez has told you people are
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
not taking there are thousands of
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
providers that get emails every month
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
reminding them of this course and 59
 
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
have signed up so that those are the
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
reasons why we need to have this
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
mandated thank you for listening I'm
 
00:52:20.109 --> 00:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for the doctor
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative love thank you Mr
 
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for your testimony
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um the
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh child abuse is a pretty complex thing
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
as as you've described there do you
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
think one hour is enough I don't but do
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
you think and you mentioned two hours
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes we currently have a course that's
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
two hours long and meets the
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
requirements of a former proposed bill
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
which did not pass um it covers the
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
topics of recognition reporting and
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
working with the child protection system
 
00:52:59.710 --> 00:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
we felt that that course was more
 
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensive than would be necessary
 
00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:05.559 align:start position:0%
for for example an orthopedist who might
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
see children
 
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
occasionally my husband's a retired
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
cardiologist he saw adults but every
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
once in a while a 17-year-old would come
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
through his office he would have to take
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
this kind of training um and the
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
material that's in the 2-hour course is
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive than people in those
 
00:53:27.309 --> 00:53:27.319 align:start position:0%
kinds of roles really need to
 
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
I we believe it can be safely lowered to
 
00:53:34.109 --> 00:53:34.119 align:start position:0%
1 hour so the requirement may be 1 hour
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
but we'll still keep the two-hour course
 
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
available so people in particularly in
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Hospital medicine emergency
 
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
medicine if they want to take the
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
two-hour course there it is it's free
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
they get their free continuing education
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
credits um but one hour is sufficient
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
for many people who only see children
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
occasionally thank
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for the doctor
 
00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
representative Rong thank you Mr
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned some of the
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
states that have this requirement do you
 
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
know how many total in the United States
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
have it how many states yes um well I'm
 
00:54:15.549 --> 00:54:15.559 align:start position:0%
aware of Iowa New York Pennsylvania
 
00:54:15.559 --> 00:54:17.789 align:start position:0%
aware of Iowa New York Pennsylvania
Maine

00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:17.799 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:54:17.799 --> 00:54:19.470 align:start position:0%
Maine
Delaware

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
Delaware
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
um off the top of my head those are the
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
ones I can think
 
00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:26.839 align:start position:0%
of seeing no further question questions
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor for your testimony you
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%

convenience make enough copies for
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
everybody else including we don't have
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
enough of Dr mat's testimony so if
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
somebody would hand her a copy of his so

gay The Honorable
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
Betty gay served your time thank you
 
00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
hearing this really sensitive issue um I
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
can just add to the professionals My
 
00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
Views as a person watching people who
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
may be reluctant to uh reluctant to
 
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
report something that they're not sure
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
about uh the question the very serious
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
question that came up last year was is
 
00:55:58.029 --> 00:55:58.039 align:start position:0%
this going to add to the two hours or
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
one hour to the training that a medical
 
00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
personnel have to come well anybody who
 
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
has to acrew hours is going to make sure
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
that whatever course they sign up is
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
approved by that agency that's counting
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
the hours so we already know that there
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
are professional courses right now
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
available and they are approved uh for
 
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
this purpose so we don't have to worry
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
that we're adding extra burden
 
00:56:29.309 --> 00:56:29.319 align:start position:0%
to to the professionals to take the
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
class um refreshing information
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge is never a bad idea if you've
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
got to take a 100 hours and 50 are
 
00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
really very very rated very
 
00:56:47.549 --> 00:56:47.559 align:start position:0%
important it never hurts to be refreshed
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
on things that you studied before but
 
00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
there's always the chance that there's
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
new information that has been identified
 
00:56:59.789 --> 00:56:59.799 align:start position:0%
so it's never a going to hurt to be
 
00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
refreshed uh and the issue that the man
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
who represents hospitals was saying some
 
00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:10.039 align:start position:0%
of us were nodding our heads as he was
 
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
saying well why mandate this when we
 
00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
have so many other reportable uh issues
 
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
well sure go ahead and mandate it if
 
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
it's if it's happening a lot and people
 
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
are getting hurt that's okay but that's
 
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
not an argument against something that
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
we know exists sadly exists a lot
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
um in the last two days I had the most
 
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
unsettling experience because I usually
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
don't have to think about child abuse
 
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
but in two days yesterday I got called
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
by a mother whose children she's watched
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
being hurt she's been hurt uh and is
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
struggling uh who really appreciates
 
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
Miss Sanchez's organization who has been
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
helping ful but her children are
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
severely severely autistic and and
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
reacting from being hurt and one of the
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
problems they have are broken bones from
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
being thrown against a wall or even
 
00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:15.039 align:start position:0%
against a bed that was so hard it broke
 
00:58:15.039 --> 00:58:15.789 align:start position:0%
against a bed that was so hard it broke
the

00:58:15.789 --> 00:58:15.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
bed then the day before I'm talking with
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
friends celebrating a
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
birthday and the subject of her husband
 
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:31.789 --> 00:58:31.799 align:start position:0%
as an adult going undergoing treatment
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
for cancer he was x-rayed and the doctor
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
looking at those x-rays said did you
 
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.510 align:start position:0%
looking at those x-rays said did you
play

00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
play
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
football and he said no he says any
 
00:58:41.359 --> 00:58:42.349 align:start position:0%
football and he said no he says any
contact

00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
contact
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
Sports no he has so many broken
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
bones in his
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
body and he forgot why he had them this
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
is a common thing for a child who AB
 
00:58:59.789 --> 00:58:59.799 align:start position:0%
been abused they suppressed the memories
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
so they went home and called his sister
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
who's a few years older and said oh yes
 
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
our father threw you against the wall
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
all the
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
time child abuse exists it's ugly it's
 
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
horrible it's left me shaking I'm
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
gradually getting over the impact of
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
just hearing about this but it happens
 
00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
all the time and we need to take the
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
steps to make sure it gets recognized
 
00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
and this bill of course is going to
 
00:59:34.029 --> 00:59:34.039 align:start position:0%
remind them how to report so please pass
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
this we're not adding to the
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
burden but we're going to reveal and
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
help children who are being abused thank
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
you former representative gay does
 
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions for her uh
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank Youk the chair would like to call
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
you cited numbers of people who have
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
taken your course the uh course that I
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
assume the New Hampshire chapter is
 
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
generated yes are there other courses
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
that deal with the same material that
 
01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
other physicians may have taken on this
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
subject um the I don't believe so and
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
the reason is that particularly
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned in this course
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
um is how the child protection system in
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire works so there are plenty
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
of national courses on child abuse and
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
neglect but they're not State specific
 
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
most Physicians get their training
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire and then come
 
01:00:46.589 --> 01:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
to our state to practice and as a result
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
they're not familiar with our laws and
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
part of the reason to have a course like
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
this is to explain how New Hampshire
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
fines physical abuse emotional abuse
 
01:01:02.109 --> 01:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse so and so forth um and
 
01:01:03.309 --> 01:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
that's why I don't believe there are
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
other courses at the present time there
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
there certainly could be that's why the
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
law the bill says that if there is
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
another course like that as long as it
 
01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
covers these topics as determined by the
 
01:01:18.029 --> 01:01:18.039 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire chapter of the American
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
Academy of Pediatrics it would fulfill
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
the requirements my followup is
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
certainly if a requirement in your mind
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
is that they're educated in the laws of
 
01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I would doubt that taking
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
a course that comes from elsewhere you
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
would ever recognize anyone else other
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
than your own
 
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
course I'm
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
sorry I'll rephrase my question if other
 
01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:46.039 align:start position:0%
places have courses on the recognition
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
of child abuse and
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
neglect but they do not mention specific
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire things when the bill says
 
01:01:59.549 --> 01:01:59.559 align:start position:0%
that credited for a course that is
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
recognized by the New Hampshire chapter
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
of the Academy of Pediatrics you
 
01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't recognize those other courses
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
because in your opinion they don't deal
 
01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire issues that's correct
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
it's important that providers know
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
specifically how to work with a system
 
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
in New
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so no one else would be
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
recognize other than your own course
 
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
they would if they included that if they
 
01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
included in Hampshire things correct
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much chair recognizes
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%

fry and you know I thought you were
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
representing OPEC but then I realized

you wrote in lowercase letters so you're
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%

counselor

01:03:04.029 --> 01:03:04.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
proceed well thank you all for having me
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it um we don't take any
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
position on this bill I just reviewed
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
the language in the statute and we had
 
01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:14.039 align:start position:0%
some concerns about how we would
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
operationalize it if it did go through
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to um raise those concerns
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
with you um so you're aware of them so
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
the bill as currently written seeks to
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
require those who are licensed as a
 
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
physician physicians assistant or nurse
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
practitioner and treats patients under
 
01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
age uh 18 to take certain education
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
requirements um as the statute kind of
 
01:03:40.589 --> 01:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
says we license individuals to practice
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
as a physician a physician assistant a
 
01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:45.079 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner we don't license
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
people to practice as a pediatrician or
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
to work with people who are under the
 
01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
age of
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
18 um so because of
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
that we don't collect data on specialty
 
01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
areas for doctors or nurse practitioners
 
01:04:02.829 --> 01:04:02.839 align:start position:0%
or physicians assistant and your license
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
when you get it right is a license to
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
practice as a physician or physician
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
assistant or as a nurse practitioner so
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
even during your two-year term right
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
we've heard a couple people talk about
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
the two-year renewal cycle that you have
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
you could technically practice in
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
multiple areas with your license um
 
01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
because there's no restriction on that
 
01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:28.839 align:start position:0%
I'm not so so the issue there then is
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
that we have concerns about how we'd be
 
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
able to operationalize the bill as
 
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
currently written because we're not
 
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
tracking who is a pediatrician and who
 
01:04:39.269 --> 01:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
works with children under
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
18 I think this is a very important
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
point that we all need to hear back up
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
about a sentence and a half please sure
 
01:04:50.589 --> 01:04:50.599 align:start position:0%
yep so because because we license
 
01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
Physicians and we license Physicians
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
assistants and we license nurse
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
practitioners and they have everybody
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
has a specialty right we all know that
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
in medical practice but that's not what
 
01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
we're licensing we don't really have
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
that data so for us to operationalize
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
the bill as currently written where it's
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
so specific to um treating patients
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 to take certain
 
01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
requirements we don't really have the
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
ability to do that we don't it would be
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
an honor System essentially right
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
someone would say would take the
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
course because they think it's the right
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
thing to do and I don't know whether if
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
someone's in a you know if you're in a a
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
primary care physician and you take on a
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
a patient that's under 18 and maybe you
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
didn't expect to do that we have no way
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
to track that because you have a
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
physician's license you don't have a
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
license to treat someone under the age
 
01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:45.990 align:start position:0%
license to treat someone under the age
of

01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
18 any question specifically on that
 
01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
point representative Raymond by a nose
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um thank you um
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
attorney for sry for for taking my
 
01:05:59.269 --> 01:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
so so it sounds like that would mean
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
that this requirement to take the
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
training um would apply to everybody on
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
the list regardless of what specially
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
what specialty area they practice in so
 
01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
someone working at a nursing home as a
 
01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
you know um physician assistant would
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
also have to take this
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
training so so was currently written
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's not the way I'm reading it
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
but but based on your ability to track
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
it right you wouldn't be able to correct
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
right opt people out you would ask
 
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
everyone to just do it correct we
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that data and even if we
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
had that data right you have you have a
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
license to practice as a physician or a
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner or a physician's
 
01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
assistant so maybe today you're working
 
01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
as a pediatric I don't know right and
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
then you decide you want to change your
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
specialty we don't have any way to track
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
that during a two-year period because
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
they've been giving a license to
 
01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
practice as a physician
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up uh no followup I'm
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
good ready to go you had a question go
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
oh I'm
 
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
sorry finishing second today is
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson sorry about that
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
um so um thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
um would you have a suggestion on how we
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
could rewrite this bill as an amendment
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
to um solve that problem so
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
I our office we try to be very concerned
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
with not inserting ourselves in
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
legislating I'm happy to tell you like
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
what the concern is so the concern is
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
that um it's the requirement is for
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
folks that are under um treating
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
patients that are under the age of 18
 
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
and so we don't have a license type that
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
really fits that right it's you have a
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
generic Physician's license you have a
 
01:07:52.599 --> 01:07:54.109 align:start position:0%
generic Physician's license you have a
generic

01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
generic
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
um It's kind an all or nothing right if
 
01:07:58.990 --> 01:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
that I don't know if that helps answer
 
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
your question a little
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
bit any further questions representative
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
rung thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so currently New
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a minimum amount of hours
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
that are required for ler renewal how
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
many of those hours are currently
 
01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
mandated to have training in a specific
 
01:08:23.789 --> 01:08:23.799 align:start position:0%
area um well it depends on what board
 
01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
you're looking at so for inance medicine
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's you've got I'm just pulling up
 
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
their continuing education rule right
 
01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
now but they have different categories
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
they have category one category two um
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
and then they have to be I'm looking at
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
category one it says the courses shall
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
be courses or activities which satisfy
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
the current requirements of the American
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
Medical association's physician
 
01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
recognition award program so I mean it's
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's fairly broad um but it really
 
01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
depends on what you're looking at for
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
I'm not even looking at physician
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
assistants or um nurse practitioners so
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's kind
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
of um I mean there were the opioid
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
credits that folks have talked about
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
right that's a
 
01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
mandatory um I forget how many hours it
 
01:09:10.749 --> 01:09:10.759 align:start position:0%
is but um that's a mandatory credit
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's kind of like Universal for each
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
one of those uh license types I don't
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
know if it's
 
01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.709 align:start position:0%
know if it's
helpful

01:09:17.709 --> 01:09:17.719 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
y any further
 
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:23.480 align:start position:0%

medical society's 20 physician members
 
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
in opposition to House Bill 493 which
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
would require education on child abuse
 
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
and neglect for certain Health Care
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
Providers as a condition of
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
licensure I want to acknowledge the
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
physicians Dr Gladstone and Dr Aral who
 
01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
have come forward to elevate the
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
importance of identifying and Reporting
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
child abuse on this our
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
vision and priorities are in alignment
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
this is an unusual position where the
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
medical society and a medical specialty
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
are not aligned the medical society and
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
our members are already working outside
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
of the legislative process to increase
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
awareness for child abuse detecting and
 
01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
Reporting the New Hampshire Medical
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
society's board councel and legislative
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
committee believe that this is an issue
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
better addressed by the medical board
 
01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
medical society and Physicians rather
 
01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.229 align:start position:0%
medical society and Physicians rather
than

01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
legislatively if passed this bill
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
requires new and renewing Physicians and
 
01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
other practi practioners who treat
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
patients under 18 two or one however
 
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
that that lands um on child abuse and
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
neglect on an ongoing basis Physicians
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
are already required to complete a 100
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
hours of continuing medical education
 
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
every two years we believe this could
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
and should include a broad spectrum of
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
training and education that relates to
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
improved clinical and practice knowledge
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
and skill designating this issue as a
 
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for all Physicians creates a
 
01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
man mandate that we that may be relevant
 
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
for some but may not for all while
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
pediatricians and emergency physicians
 
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
may see these cases more often other
 
01:12:09.149 --> 01:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
Specialists or clinicians noted in the
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
bill May rarely if ever be in a position
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
to report child abuse requiring this
 
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
broadly as a bill as this bill does
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
regardless of relevance to practice may
 
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
be inefficient and
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary while child abuse education
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
is undoubtedly important
 
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
legislating a strict condition of lure
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
adds another layer of complexity cost
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
and administrative burden many
 
01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
Physicians already receive education on
 
01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
child abuse through their medical
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
training workplace protocols or existing
 
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.189 align:start position:0%
training workplace protocols or existing
CME

01:12:44.189 --> 01:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
requirements mandating an additional
 
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
course may lead to redundancy rather
 
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
than meaningful improvements in patient
 
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
care or reporting practices we believe a
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
more flexible non- leg lative approach
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
would be more effective without being
 
01:13:01.149 --> 01:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily burdensome for this reason
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
we cannot support House Bill 493 as
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
written and amended thank you for your
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
time and consideration of my testimony
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
it would be your testimony Contra to the
 
01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
testimony of a few others that as you
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
read the bill and the amendment it does
 
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
in fact not say anything about whether
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
these one or two hours would be included
 
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
in the 100 hours or not it would be your
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
inference it would be an add-on as it
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
was somebody else's inference it was
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
included in in both cases
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
inferences and it's it's definitely
 
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
rice thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question you had mentioned
 
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
that they get training in their uh
 
01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
during like their medical training um
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
when they're training for the position
 
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
what if they're doing that in New York
 
01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
and we're in New Hampshire how do we
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
assure that they are getting training on
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's child abuse
 
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
statute thank you for the question um
 
01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
our position is that it is not that the
 
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
the training is not relevant or
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be happening our position is
 
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
that it shouldn't be
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
legislated um we're working with um the
 
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
physicians in the state to bring that
 
01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
information however um that's relevant
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
to the state um however it when it's
 
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
mandated on an ongoing basis that's our
 
01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:36.709 align:start position:0%
mandated on an ongoing basis that's our
concern

01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
followup thank you again for taking um
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
another question so
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
um how do you respond then to the
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
numbers that we were given of only 59
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
doctors actually taking the course
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
voluntarily and the fact that 87 nurses
 
01:14:59.550 --> 01:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
have I I'm certain we have far more than
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
59 doctors and 87 nurses in the
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
state thank you for the question um I
 
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
think my response would be that um this
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
has been newly initiated um and we need
 
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
to raise awareness for it we need to
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
encourage our physicians to be um to
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
take the training it's available um
 
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
we've we've published articles about
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
this in our physician magazine and
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
distributed it um just in the last three
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
weeks to um all Physicians across the
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
state were posting this information on
 
01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
our website um I think that there are
 
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
non- legislated opportunities here for
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
making this um Education and Training
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
available would you believe I know
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
enough about politics that sometimes the
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
threat isn't what it seems to
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
be can you repeat
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
that I think you want me to explain it
 
01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
um that sometimes s when the legislature
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
or a different branch of government
 
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
makes what seems to be onf face value a
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
threat we are really just trying to
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
encourage others to say hey wait a
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
minute there's a lot of us out here who
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
want this what are you going to do about
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
it that uh often in response people step
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
up um my question is to what degree is
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Medical Society aware
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
of what to at least me from my phone and
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
email is a ground swell of people people
 
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
saying you got to do something about
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
this more than is being done now are you
 
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
aware of that as a board absolutely we
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
are um and and like I said we're working
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
we're working with our pediatrician
 
01:16:38.629 --> 01:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
Partners um to make this available and
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
to raise awareness um you
 
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
know I I think I think that um this
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation has brought forward
 
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
that issue and and and whether it needs
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
to be legislated or not um I think it's
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
elevated it in a in a very important way
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and that's why I started my testimony
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
with with an acknowledgement for those
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
that came forward um I'm going to start
 
01:17:07.709 --> 01:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
my followup with a sentence that leads
 
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
into a question and the sentence is I
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
have asked some Physicians and nurses
 
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
not necessarily on my own
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
staff describe what you look for in
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect and was very pleased
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
if the articulation they gave
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
I asked them had they taken the
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
course that was referenced here this
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
morning and they said no we just know
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
this yeah so my question is have you had
 
01:17:38.669 --> 01:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
similar conversations with Physicians
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners Physicians
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
assistants and the like and received
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
similar uh responses that they do
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
know we actually no we haven't um you
 
01:17:50.669 --> 01:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
know I
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
think our position has always been to
 
01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
advocate for those vulnerable people and
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
um you know we we haven't we haven't
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
looked for the the negative you know in
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
this um only that we want to support it
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
we just don't want to see it legislated
 
01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
okay all righty uh so on the other hand
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative coal coron thank you Mr
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
um I understand that you're saying that
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
you don't think it should be legislated
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
however um what does your Society say
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
about a physician who hears that a
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
seven-year-old was hit in the head and
 
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
has to go to the emergency room and then
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
that physician just forgets about it
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
um how is how does your Society plan on
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
taking a stand against that so no other
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
child has to do
 
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question um it's
 
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
devastating I think you know the every
 
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
physician takes an oath to do no harm
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
and anytime a situation like that AR is
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
I think it's devastating um you know the
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
society itself you know again is here to
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
promote the education and the um
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
engagement with um and the resources
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
that may be
 
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
available um you know that seems to be
 
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
more of a an issue for the licensing
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
society representative rice thank you
 
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
again Mr chairman thank you you for
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
taking another question so this this
 
01:19:30.629 --> 01:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
bill language came out I believe last
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
year this committee heard this bill but
 
01:19:37.149 --> 01:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
yet you stated that only three weeks ago
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
you sent out in a magazine the import or
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
whatever you send out the importance of
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
taking this continuing education so how
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
are we to believe that that's going to
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
happen when this legislation's been
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
heard before and it took how long just
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
to get something sent
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
out thank you for the question
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative rice
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
um I've been the CEO of the medical
 
01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
society for five months uh so this is a
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
relatively new position for me and um
 
01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what position was taken by
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
my predecessor or you know in the past
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
um you know the the training and the um
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunities offer offered by Dr
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
Gladstone and Dr or
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
came to our attention and we immediately
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
put it in our magazine um and we we
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
immediately promoted it in our Weekly
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
Newsletter um so so when it came to my
 
01:20:39.149 --> 01:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
attention I took immediate
 
01:20:39.159 --> 01:20:40.669 align:start position:0%
attention I took immediate
action

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
followup do you happen to have the
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
numbers of the people who have signed up
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
since you sent out your
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
newsletter we don't have access to that
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
information I'm sorry I can I can look
 
01:20:55.229 --> 01:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
at I can I can actually
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
provide um some feedback on on who's
 
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
clicked on the links if that would be
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
helpful for the
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
committee you may not be the one to ask
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
this question to but since uh Ben
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
Bradley is left um don't hospitals
 
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
provide this training to new
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
hires that would be a question for the
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals like I said you you may not be
 
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
the one am not aware I was of that
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
opinion okay but that doesn't mean that
 
01:21:25.149 --> 01:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean a negative it's not it's
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
just it's my own limited awareness of it
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay question over here from
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative George thank you Mr
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
chairman and I thank you to have my
 
01:21:37.149 --> 01:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
question um I just because I'm just
 
01:21:41.709 --> 01:21:41.719 align:start position:0%
reading this um testimony uh the way she
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
explained here almost 40 years I practic
 
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
in the seal first as a a primary care
 
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
provider and then a special she support
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
really because if she she know she think
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
not she think but she supported that
 
01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
that bill because for how many kids go
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
back home um not reported and they they
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
have a problem because for that then
 
01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
what how you can oppose that because
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
just canot prove me for that I think I
 
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
need to clarify that we are
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely not saying that we how do I
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
say we absolutely absolutely support
 
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
efforts to increase
 
01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
the detection and reporting of child
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
abuse it's the mandating it
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
to follow up
 
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
please follow
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman and um for me
 
01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
you just can for me because if I hear
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
everybody what they say and to read all
 
01:23:02.669 --> 01:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
those testimony I think so this is very
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
important um for the state for the State
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and I think so is
 
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
better for us
 
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
to to get a a right decision that why I
 
01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.149 align:start position:0%
to to get a a right decision that why I
can

01:23:15.149 --> 01:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:23:18.189 --> 01:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
say if you don't think
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%

01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
your opposition is to the Mandate and uh
 
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
you know child abuse is a thing that's
 
01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
been going on since the be beginning of
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
time and uh you know it's uh others have
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
has testified that uh the uh the courses
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
have been offered and they're available
 
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
yet it doesn't seem like anybody's uh
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
stepping up and taking them uh this is
 
01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:00.280 align:start position:0%
the reason for a mandate uh if uh can
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
you explain further explain how you know
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
that uh you know just a voluntary thing
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
might work where it hasn't thank you
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative love um I think I think
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
the feedback that you got was that this
 
01:24:15.629 --> 01:24:15.639 align:start position:0%
was the participation in this particular
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
course and again I think it's my from my
 
01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
understanding it's relatively new so um
 
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
I think to say broadly that Physicians
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
and other clinicians are not engaging in
 
01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
child abuse training
 
01:24:35.629 --> 01:24:35.639 align:start position:0%
education um may be unwarranted from
 
01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
that particular fact um so I I you our
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
physician members are very very
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
conscientious and um they want to do
 
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
their best and um they take an oath to
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
First Do no harm and if this
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
if this course is available and um which
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
it is and I I I mean I strongly believe
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
participation thank you representative
 
01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
grund thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so it's same
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
question I asked earlier to another
 
01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:21.400 align:start position:0%
person um but is the Assumption of
 
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
training being done the same as a
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
requirement and knowing it is getting
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
done thank you representative for the
 
01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:35.030 align:start position:0%
done thank you representative for the
question

01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to think of how to answer
 
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
that because the data of whether it's
 
01:25:42.189 --> 01:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
being done or not is probably available
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
um Physicians are going online they
 
01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
every two years it's part of their
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
requirements they um are required to
 
01:25:51.109 --> 01:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
report to CE broker what courses they
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
took and and um I would assume that the
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
data is out there for you know present
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
and past to look at which courses are
 
01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
being taken um and and what the what the
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
impact of that might be um you know I
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
think this is this is front and foremost
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
on people's minds right now so my you
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
know and that's why we put it in the
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
physician magazine is just that it's
 
01:26:22.189 --> 01:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
really important for our physicians to
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
update their training to refine and
 
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
refresh their skills um and again it's
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
it's not about the it's not about the
 
01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
training it's the Mandate um you know
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
and and I think that there there are
 
01:26:39.149 --> 01:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
other opportunities to look at this um
 
01:26:41.709 --> 01:26:41.719 align:start position:0%
it could be it could be taken to the
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
medical board um where it could be
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
discussed there that would be another
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
Avenue for which um that and other
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
licensing boards um rather than having
 
01:26:58.109 --> 01:26:58.119 align:start position:0%
it um enacted in state
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
law since I have received several phone
 
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
calls from people indicating other
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
mandated courses that the legislature
 
01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.510 align:start position:0%
mandated courses that the legislature
should

01:27:10.510 --> 01:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
require uh would you join me in being
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
concerned that a bill like this that on
 
01:27:20.590 --> 01:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
the sole issue of mandate nothing else
 
01:27:25.109 --> 01:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
right would open or widen a Floodgate of
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
many bills essentially now uh telling
 
01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:31.350 align:start position:0%
many bills essentially now uh telling
how

01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
CE medical continuing education units
 
01:27:37.149 --> 01:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
should be conducted that's that that's
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
right that's a strong concern of the
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
medical society okay thank you any other
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you and I
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
have no more pink cards um so I am going
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
to close the hearing on
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
493 and um I I I have
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
to have an exec session on this sometime
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
today I could open it and then postpone
 
01:28:11.189 --> 01:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
it two weeks I could do that or um with
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
some of the uh possible suggestions on
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
662 such as specifically saying this is
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
not additional but part of and looking
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
at the question that was raised should
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
this be under 32916 on six not 169
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
possibly an amendment could be crafted
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
over the lunch hour uh I hate to deprive
 
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.080 align:start position:0%

thank you you're welcome see that's the
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
advantage of being the acting full
 
01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.070 align:start position:0%
advantage of being the acting full
ranking

01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
ranking
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
honorary minority party I'm looking for
 
01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
the the noun in here um goddess works
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.709 --> 01:29:23.719 align:start position:0%
it all right now for those of you who
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
are watching or sitting there watching
 
01:29:26.239 --> 01:29:26.950 align:start position:0%
are watching or sitting there watching
and

01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
listening um I'm inclined not to start
 
01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
the exact session on House Bill
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
10 um in about 20 or minutes or so
 
01:29:39.070 --> 01:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
simply because we're going to have to
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
stop for lunch so if
 
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
um if the next Bills
 
01:29:49.709 --> 01:29:49.719 align:start position:0%
hearing goes short and we have about 10
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
or 15 minutes I will open an exact
 
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
session on on ones that are relatively
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
easy in other words hb10 will not be
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
exact until this afternoon probably
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
about 1:00 so that's for those of you
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
who want to plan your
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
day I now open the hearing on House Bill
 
01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
543 establishing a committee to study
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
how the Family Division customarily
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
treats accusations of domestic violence
 
01:30:22.030 --> 01:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
and to study current Family Division
 
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
practices relative to the right to
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
testify and right to submit evidence and
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%

01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%

House Bill 543 this bill establishes a
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
study committee to examine the practices
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
of the Family Division of the court in
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
relation to domestic violence the
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
establishment of this study committee is
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
crucial to ensure we're meeting legisl
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
ative best practices aimed at improving
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
the Court's capacity to minimize risk
 
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
and harm to families during the
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
proceedings of the special Committee of
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
the family court extensive testimony was
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
presented on the issue of domestic
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
violence however due to the
 
01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive nature of the committee
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
scope there was inadequate time to
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
thoroughly examine this specific topic
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore while the governor has a
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
commission on domestic violence that
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
covers a broad scope including aspects
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
including law enforcement this study
 
01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
committee would focus specifically
 
01:33:26.109 --> 01:33:26.119 align:start position:0%
excuse me on any legislation needed
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
court thank you I would like to uh point
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
out that the subcommittee if if created
 
01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
would be addressing immediately the
 
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
denial of constitutional rights of due
 
01:33:46.109 --> 01:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
process of accepting testimony or
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
accepting evidence that's something I
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
think that can be addressed immediately
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
because the violation of constitutional
 
01:33:58.270 --> 01:33:58.280 align:start position:0%
rights is exceedingly serious We As
 
01:34:00.109 --> 01:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
Americans have these constitutional
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
rights but New Hampshire family court
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
allows a judge to decide whether or not
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
you get them that's not a right okay
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
that's a privilege and family court
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
needs to run on rights so my suggestion
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
is you either pass the bill this
 
01:34:20.109 --> 01:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
afternoon that would immediately do that
 
01:34:23.229 --> 01:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
or you immediately address it in this in
 
01:34:25.229 --> 01:34:25.239 align:start position:0%
this uh um
 
01:34:25.239 --> 01:34:26.870 align:start position:0%
this uh um
proposal

01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
um the governor's commission I attended
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
some of those there was no testimony
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
when I went from the people affected it
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
was just all the agencies so agencies
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
sat around and talked about what they do
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
but they weren't addressing the issues
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
as people who were not treated well and
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh so they didn't talk about the
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
problems that needed to be addressed so
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
I guess this is pretty simple what I'm
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
asking you to do either pass the
 
01:34:59.669 --> 01:34:59.679 align:start position:0%
correction now this afternoon in House
 
01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 5
 
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
652 or a re accept the fact that it's a
 
01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
serious serious violation of our
 
01:35:09.629 --> 01:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and address it
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
immediately in a a study committee and
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
put in a bill don't talk about it for
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
two years more I would address the
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative and former representative
 
01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
asking were you here when I
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
appointed a subcommittee to deal with
 
01:35:27.709 --> 01:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
exactly this that was appointed this
 
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
morning yes I heard that so I'm going to
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
move itl when we get to exact not
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
because it's a bad Bill it's a great
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
bill it's been done if you would have
 
01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
pass if we would have passed this bill
 
01:35:42.109 --> 01:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
and then it crosses over to the Senate
 
01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
and then the Senate deals with it and
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
then it gets to the governor and then it
 
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
gets assigned and then they call me
 
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
asking who should be on this
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
committee from the house point of view
 
01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
it might that subcommittee or that
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
committee might start its work in
 
01:36:01.709 --> 01:36:01.719 align:start position:0%
September or June but not until then it
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
won't happen today if we execute
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
positively has to go to the floor has to
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
go to the Senate has to go to the
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
governor but the subcommittee of this
 
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
committee that was appointed this
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
morning has two specific things to look
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
at and this is one of them so it has
 
01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:21.669 align:start position:0%
at and this is one of them so it has
been

01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
appointed duplication would not undo the
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee duplication would be highly
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
confusing I think our IQs are higher
 
01:36:34.590 --> 01:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
than that I think some of the people who
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
are most interested in this will be very
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
welcome as guests at our subcommittee
 
01:36:42.189 --> 01:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
yes but if you are sir if you are asked
 
01:36:44.189 --> 01:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
to start another committee you already
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
have the people selected and you could
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
even add more people to it we really
 
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
need to involve more people so that it's
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
because lots of us are very concerned
 
01:36:58.270 --> 01:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
about domestic abuse and uh what the the
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
problems facing family court but we
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
don't have a huge number of people
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
aware any questions any questions for
 
01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
table thank you seeing none thank you
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and this concludes
 
01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.070 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and this concludes
the

01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%

01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
543 and through the miracle of modern
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
technology I have the blurb
 
01:39:53.589 --> 01:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
bu what was the vote what was the vote
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
to 16 to
 
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
nothing and like I say I just want to
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
say it again it's a great Bill and had
 
01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
this not special subcommittee been
 
01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
appointed I'd say go for it so we did it
 
01:40:07.149 --> 01:40:07.159 align:start position:0%
in a different
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
way uh all right
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
um that concludes the exec session
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
on uh 5:43 and since it's past 11:00
 
01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
which means this is legal I will now
 
01:40:26.669 --> 01:40:26.679 align:start position:0%
open an exact session on um House Bill
 
01:40:30.270 --> 01:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
430 an act reducing the retention period
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
for records of unfounded abuse and
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
neglect reports by the Department of
 
01:40:37.390 --> 01:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and the chair
 
01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative rice for a
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman I move itl
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 430 and the second
 
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
representative Greg and representative
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
rice would you speak to the motion
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679 align:start position:0%
please yeah so
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
um are you ready for me yep okay um
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
so reports of abuse and neglect can be
 
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
deemed unfounded but maintaining those
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
records can show a pattern and this is
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
something we just put into Statute in
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
like 2017
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
and you know no one else has access to
 
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
your reports it's all confidential so
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
the the the concerns we heard about you
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
know employers finding out or things
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
like that just don't
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
happen um so for those reasons and for
 
01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.350 align:start position:0%
happen um so for those reasons and for
protecting

01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
children I'm moving
 
01:41:52.669 --> 01:41:52.679 align:start position:0%
itl anyone else wish to speak to it
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative Greg and I would like to
 
01:41:57.070 --> 01:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
reiterate for everyone that this is not
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know not something that people can
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
get a hold of um and and it also helps
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
out when we're looking at statistically
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
how things are looking in the state how
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
our courts are handling things um
 
01:42:10.589 --> 01:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
looking at these reports if the courts
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
have to get into them is very very
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
important but once again it is not
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
something anyone can just go check like
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
a a sex offender registry or anything
 
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
else so um while I think this is good
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
intentioned for some people people it's
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
misplaced and would overall do more harm
 
01:42:26.159 --> 01:42:27.229 align:start position:0%
misplaced and would overall do more harm
than

01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
good representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
01:42:34.229 --> 01:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
chairman I just wanted to add that um
 
01:42:37.709 --> 01:42:37.719 align:start position:0%
from a supporting the child uh or
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
children standpoint um we also discussed
 
01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
that there may be an unfounded report on
 
01:42:50.109 --> 01:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
abuse of child a um but subsequent um
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
abuse May intensify to children B and C
 
01:42:57.149 --> 01:42:57.159 align:start position:0%
and that might be recognized and and uh
 
01:42:58.669 --> 01:42:58.679 align:start position:0%
those children were supported but
 
01:43:00.270 --> 01:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
looking back at a
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
history um child
 
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
a might also need that type of support
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh that wouldn't necessarily have been
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
recognized in the first report that was
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
unfounded and Mr representative rice and
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
if I could just add that the pattern can
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
not only show a pattern of abuse or
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
neglect but it could also show a
 
01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
a pattern of malicious
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
reporting so I think this benefits all
 
01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
areas thank
 
01:43:38.109 --> 01:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
guests that's not to say they're not
 
01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
honorable but you know what I mean up
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%

01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
chairman I will
 
01:46:26.189 --> 01:46:26.199 align:start position:0%
try um I believe that HP 661 is in the
 
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child um this bill
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
is specific to those who are
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
um awarded money from the state um the
 
01:46:41.950 --> 01:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
in the past DCF has been taking that
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
money um this bill hopes to put that
 
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
money back into the child's hands once
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
that child ages out of foster care this
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
this could be huge for foster kids who
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
are just starting their life it could be
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
mean it could mean you know being able
 
01:47:00.030 --> 01:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
to buy their own their first car or even
 
01:47:03.310 --> 01:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
put down first and last on an apartment
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
money anyone else wish to speak on this
 
01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:14.510 align:start position:0%
money anyone else wish to speak on this
representative

01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr
 
01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
chairman this money belongs to these
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
kids it's a no-brainer it's their money
 
01:47:27.149 --> 01:47:27.159 align:start position:0%
so why shouldn't they have it so I I
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
don't I've never understood why we would
 
01:47:33.790 --> 01:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
even contemplate keeping it from them um
 
01:47:37.709 --> 01:47:37.719 align:start position:0%
no child who does not receive social
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
security has to pay back the foster care
 
01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:43.719 align:start position:0%
system why does a child who does receive
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
Social Security have to pay back the
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
foster care system it seems an inequity
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
there I'm 100% for this
 
01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
any further statements in this exec
 
01:47:59.229 --> 01:47:59.239 align:start position:0%
session on 661 representative
 
01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman I just
 
01:48:04.270 --> 01:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to add that um the bill doesn't
 
01:48:06.589 --> 01:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
mandate that the state save all the
 
01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
money for the child what it says is that
 
01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:11.719 align:start position:0%
the state has to consider what the best
 
01:48:13.629 --> 01:48:13.639 align:start position:0%
application of the money is and I know
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
when I worked at DCF there were cases
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
where a child being removed from the
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
home and that Social Security being
 
01:48:22.990 --> 01:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
removed from the family meant that the
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
family could no longer pay their rent
 
01:48:26.669 --> 01:48:26.679 align:start position:0%
which meant that the kid didn't have a
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
home to ever come back to and the fact
 
01:48:32.189 --> 01:48:32.199 align:start position:0%
that that happens is appalling and you
 
01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
know I I think that um this bill will
 
01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
solve some of that problem um I would
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
love to also save money for kids when
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
they age out I think that's really
 
01:48:43.229 --> 01:48:43.239 align:start position:0%
important but I also want to maximize
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
their chances of going home when their
 
01:48:48.270 --> 01:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
parents Rectify their parenting errors
 
01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
um and not set the family up for failure
 
01:48:53.669 --> 01:48:53.679 align:start position:0%
from day one
 
01:48:53.679 --> 01:48:55.790 align:start position:0%

Lori well they all have both have four
 
01:51:46.069 --> 01:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
letters all right the check chair
 
01:51:48.750 --> 01:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative coren for a
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
motion um on Bill HB 652 I would like to
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
retain this for
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
committee the motion is to retain we
 
01:51:59.470 --> 01:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
second who is the second representative
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
love and representative coren would you
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
please I would like to retain this for
 
01:52:14.109 --> 01:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
study um because we do recognize that
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
there are issues within the family court
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
system um I know that there is the
 
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that's already been
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
presented by chair
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson and I would like to um make sure
 
01:52:29.390 --> 01:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
that this issue specifically is really
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
looked into and not just brushed
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
aside anyone else wish to speak
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
representative Greg I disagree with this
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
motion only because we do have uh we
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
already passed or we already have the
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and also I think that we've
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
learned anytime that we have a bill that
 
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
has a hostile um nature for the courts
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
it's harder to get cooperation it's
 
01:52:54.750 --> 01:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
harder to get people in to um testify
 
01:52:57.069 --> 01:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
and I do think this bill um is
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
incredibly hostile in nature I actually
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
think that puts our Cooperative efforts
 
01:53:04.270 --> 01:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
with the family courts as far as finding
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
issues and fixing them in Jeopardy so I
 
01:53:09.390 --> 01:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
would go against this um motion you
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
would think a proper motion or in your
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
um belief would be what I think a proper
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
motion would be itl and I would really
 
01:53:18.990 --> 01:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
encourage the sponsors of that bill to
 
01:53:22.510 --> 01:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
come to our sessions and really um learn
 
01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
all that we get to sess out because we
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
certainly have made a lot of good um
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
momentum from our last
 
01:53:32.830 --> 01:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee the um topic of retain
 
01:53:35.470 --> 01:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
versus itl was one of considerable
 
01:53:40.069 --> 01:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
discussion in our caucus and
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
um we see both sides to that so what I
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
would suggest we do presently is have a
 
01:53:50.350 --> 01:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
brief discussion as to whether different
 
01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
ones of you think let's retain it which
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily mean we have to do
 
01:53:58.350 --> 01:53:58.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of work on the bill it means we do
 
01:54:01.229 --> 01:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of work on the topic which is the
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or we simply itl it
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
outright so I'd be interested to see
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
what other committee members think if
 
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
the issue is retained versus
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
itl hands representative
 
01:54:18.069 --> 01:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chairman um just to
 
01:54:21.870 --> 01:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
reiterate most of what you just said um
 
01:54:25.390 --> 01:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
this morning morning you identified a uh
 
01:54:28.750 --> 01:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
committee that will really look into the
 
01:54:34.030 --> 01:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
court system um if this
 
01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
bill continues to be what we believe it
 
01:54:44.189 --> 01:54:44.199 align:start position:0%
is then it's very simple in uh the fall
 
01:54:47.229 --> 01:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
we our report retention report would
 
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
just read that the bill was unnecessary
 
01:54:53.709 --> 01:54:53.719 align:start position:0%
simple easy
 
01:54:58.990 --> 01:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
if we find that there may be some issue
 
01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
that needs to be looked at then I
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
suppose we could entertain a motion
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise but right now I think that
 
01:55:13.709 --> 01:55:13.719 align:start position:0%
retaining it is for me it's um the
 
01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
optimal motion anyone else want to weigh
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
in yes representative L now those of you
 
01:55:22.189 --> 01:55:22.199 align:start position:0%
from Coos County should know friend this
 
01:55:22.199 --> 01:55:24.990 align:start position:0%
from Coos County should know friend this
is

01:55:24.990 --> 01:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
you are good I get both um from many
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
different people could could you we be a
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
little bit louder especially the U half
 
01:55:36.589 --> 01:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
of we yeah um I get both LEC and Le and
 
01:55:36.599 --> 01:55:38.109 align:start position:0%
of we yeah um I get both LEC and Le and
Lees

01:55:38.109 --> 01:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
Lees
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
LEC yeah um I have to agree with
 
01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:44.719 align:start position:0%
representative Greg's point of this is
 
01:55:47.229 --> 01:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
very hostile towards the family court
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
system saying that we should just get
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
rid of it and put it towards back into
 
01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
the superior your courts hands despite
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know there is some good that they do
 
01:55:58.510 --> 01:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
yes we know it's this is the worst part
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
of someone's life they're going through
 
01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
a divorce they're losing their child
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
from like all the time to part of the
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
time or even just holidays depending on
 
01:56:09.310 --> 01:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
their work schedules and everything it's
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
a very hard time in that person's life
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
and to just have you know the superior
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
court is has a lot on their plate
 
01:56:20.830 --> 01:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
mediation has a lot on their plate and I
 
01:56:24.270 --> 01:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
think that putting on those entities
 
01:56:26.669 --> 01:56:26.679 align:start position:0%
versus having that separate court system
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the family courts is
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
definitely very hostile for that and I
 
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't think that this is a way to go
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
about that if we do want to bring it
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
back to the superior court system
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
so in one word do you suggest itl or
 
01:56:49.229 --> 01:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
retain I support itl itl okay anyone
 
01:56:52.030 --> 01:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
else representative love thank you Mr
 
01:56:54.030 --> 01:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
chair here I'm support and retain for
 
01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:56.119 align:start position:0%
the for the one reason that we've uh
 
01:56:58.870 --> 01:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
just established this committee and I'm
 
01:57:00.910 --> 01:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
expecting that the committee to do great
 
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
work and if we come up with with
 
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
something that uh that needs rather
 
01:57:10.510 --> 01:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
expedient uh um attention having this
 
01:57:13.390 --> 01:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
bill sitting there that we can we can
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
you know just amend at any time and put
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
what we need to do right away in it
 
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
rather than going before a rules
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
committee and waiting for non gerain or
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
gerain Amendment uh
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh decisions uh I I think uh you know
 
01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:28.679 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is a pretty important
 
01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
thing that I think we can all agree that
 
01:57:32.589 --> 01:57:32.599 align:start position:0%
the the the family courts have some some
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
serious holes in it you know the way we
 
01:57:36.589 --> 01:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
operate and uh we wouldn't have this
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
committee if we didn't let's have this
 
01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
bill sitting there waiting to to amend
 
01:57:43.069 --> 01:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
with any any ideas we come up with
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for that while I
 
01:57:50.510 --> 01:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
do understand that you know you want to
 
01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
have a bill at the ready the subcommitte
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
can also um recommend bills and stuff
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I have great
 
01:57:59.229 --> 01:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
pride with in this particular committee
 
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
is that we're very intentional about
 
01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
things we don't hold on to things just
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
because we want them to kind of like go
 
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
hide in the corner and get cobwebs until
 
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
we can make them go away later um we've
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
been incredibly intentional we
 
01:58:13.709 --> 01:58:13.719 align:start position:0%
understand the Dynamics within the court
 
01:58:15.709 --> 01:58:15.719 align:start position:0%
systems we have taken great time to hear
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
from the courts what's going on and
 
01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
building this relationship having what I
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
call a threat Bill hanging over in the
 
01:58:25.149 --> 01:58:25.159 align:start position:0%
side not only goes against everything
 
01:58:27.470 --> 01:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
that we work for in this committee it
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
also um really goes against the better
 
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
judgment of how we want these
 
01:58:33.629 --> 01:58:33.639 align:start position:0%
relationships to continue you have said
 
01:58:35.310 --> 01:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
repeatedly you know we were able to get
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
lwh hanging fruit I was able to have
 
01:58:39.550 --> 01:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
something come up we discussed it in
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
committee and they were already working
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
on it and now because of that one little
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
thing not only are they working on the
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
family courts with communication it is
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
also has a test program in the Superior
 
01:58:53.189 --> 01:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
Courts I just I understand the
 
01:58:55.390 --> 01:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
frustration I and the frustration by the
 
01:58:58.189 --> 01:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
way is not with everybody it is in our
 
01:59:00.270 --> 01:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
high conflict cases I am very
 
01:59:03.550 --> 01:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to that but this doesn't fix
 
01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
anything putting it in a corner and
 
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
making it weight also doesn't fix
 
01:59:10.709 --> 01:59:10.719 align:start position:0%
anything it just puts us in a situation
 
01:59:12.629 --> 01:59:12.639 align:start position:0%
where this you know it's kind of this
 
01:59:14.709 --> 01:59:14.719 align:start position:0%
thing like it's just over there and it
 
01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't be there like I
 
01:59:19.229 --> 01:59:19.239 align:start position:0%
strongly think that we should hold to
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
what we have done in our hard work in
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
this committee and stick to that anyone
 
01:59:27.149 --> 01:59:27.159 align:start position:0%
else representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman um I just I
 
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of the testimony that we've been
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
hearing about people's um concerns about
 
01:59:38.669 --> 01:59:38.679 align:start position:0%
the family court have a lot to do with
 
01:59:41.149 --> 01:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
evidence Rules of Evidence and they have
 
01:59:43.629 --> 01:59:43.639 align:start position:0%
a lot to do with the lack of the ability
 
01:59:46.350 --> 01:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
to appeal rulings that they feel were
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
unfair and I don't see that this bill
 
01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
improves either one of those things
 
01:59:55.229 --> 01:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
because now instead of having a judge
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
we're knocking it down to a mediator
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here about how we
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
will improve evidence or improve the
 
02:00:07.709 --> 02:00:07.719 align:start position:0%
ability to um have people be able to
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
appeal their things to something other
 
02:00:12.030 --> 02:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
than the state you know Supreme Court so
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
I I think that um there is work to be
 
02:00:17.189 --> 02:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
done and we've gotten a lot of feedback
 
02:00:19.709 --> 02:00:19.719 align:start position:0%
to that's starting to create a road map
 
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that this bill is a
 
02:00:24.109 --> 02:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
igned with the feedback that we heard
 
02:00:26.189 --> 02:00:26.199 align:start position:0%
from the committee last year or even the
 
02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill and other bills
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
which is weird like it it doesn't solve
 
02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
the problem that we keep hearing is the
 
02:00:34.990 --> 02:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
problem um and I would love to see a
 
02:00:37.390 --> 02:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
bill that solves a problem I just I I
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
need more information still anyone who
 
02:00:42.669 --> 02:00:42.679 align:start position:0%
has not spoken yet representative
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
rung a question I noticed that the uh
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is was this bill was
 
02:00:51.149 --> 02:00:51.159 align:start position:0%
awaiting a fiscal note from judicial did
 
02:00:54.189 --> 02:00:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen it I'm not going to say
 
02:00:58.069 --> 02:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
it didn't arrive okay all right thank
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
you representative George thank you Mr
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think so it's support to
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
go to the subcomittee because they can
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
do more research because a small group
 
02:01:10.950 --> 02:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
can work very uh very well how to
 
02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
looking for what is going because there
 
02:01:15.069 --> 02:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
is a problem I can say there is a
 
02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:16.679 align:start position:0%
problem and the problem we need to fix
 
02:01:19.629 --> 02:01:19.639 align:start position:0%
it and for that problem to fix it it's
 
02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
better just go to sub committee than
 
02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:23.589 align:start position:0%
better just go to sub committee than
thank

02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
you representative love thank you Mr
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
chair um I just need some clarification
 
02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know I've heard uh people ask qu
 
02:01:35.950 --> 02:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
testify that um you know we work nice
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
with the the family court the family
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
Court's troubled like we've we've all
 
02:01:42.189 --> 02:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
said does the family court answer to us
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
them neither one we are separate
 
02:01:49.950 --> 02:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
branches of the government which is why
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
a collaborative attitude is far superior
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
to the hostile attitude that others
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
display and we have gained their trust
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
and vice versa which does not mean we
 
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
can tell them what to do but we've
 
02:02:07.030 --> 02:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
already seen at least one example in the
 
02:02:08.910 --> 02:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
special committee where they're already
 
02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
going to work on it before we even had
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee hearing and there's two
 
02:02:15.069 --> 02:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
possible reasons for that number one
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
they fear representative Greg uh or more
 
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
likely they've been listening in and
 
02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
saying oh yeah
 
02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
that sounds pretty good let's do it so
 
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
the uh subcommittee that was just formed
 
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
was uh picked by me and for the purpose
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
of people who play well with other
 
02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
children and have some knowledge of the
 
02:02:39.030 --> 02:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
law to continue the tone in the
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
relationship the special committee had
 
02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
had with the Judiciary but they don't
 
02:02:47.189 --> 02:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
report to us and we don't report to them
 
02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
really do we set the rules or do they
 
02:02:53.310 --> 02:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
depends on the rules
 
02:02:55.149 --> 02:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
apparently the rules uh you know from
 
02:02:56.830 --> 02:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
the all the testimony I've heard the
 
02:02:59.790 --> 02:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
rules are very broken and we're aware of
 
02:03:03.069 --> 02:03:03.079 align:start position:0%
that sir very aware of that I I wouldn't
 
02:03:04.589 --> 02:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
worry about what they feel about it
 
02:03:06.270 --> 02:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
because it's they're so
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
broken I am happy that they feel that we
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
are an asset to them and not an invading
 
02:03:16.069 --> 02:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
Army and I wish to continue to do that

disclosure regarding any and all matters
 
03:13:24.269 --> 03:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
related to their minor child unless an
 
03:13:27.469 --> 03:13:27.479 align:start position:0%
immediate answer cannot be provided when
 
03:13:30.710 --> 03:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
the initial request is made in which
 
03:13:33.469 --> 03:13:33.479 align:start position:0%
case the answer shall be provided no
 
03:13:37.389 --> 03:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
later than 5 days after the request that
 
03:13:39.550 --> 03:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
is the only difference between the
 
03:13:51.630 --> 03:13:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:53.670 --> 03:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
we'll give everybody a minute or two to
 
03:13:57.030 --> 03:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
look at the new Amendment the newest and
 
03:14:00.830 --> 03:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
lastest Amendment and duly note the
 
03:14:03.590 --> 03:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
change from the one we previously looked
 
03:14:13.550 --> 03:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:17.910 --> 03:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
us and since this amendment 069 five is
 
03:14:21.030 --> 03:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
a case of amend the bill by replacing
 
03:14:24.030 --> 03:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
all after the enacting Clause the
 
03:14:27.229 --> 03:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
original hb10 is should this amendment
 
03:14:29.910 --> 03:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
be approved old
 
03:14:41.710 --> 03:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:45.150 --> 03:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
sir you have a
 
03:14:48.110 --> 03:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
question representative Ray
 
03:14:51.550 --> 03:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman um so my
 
03:14:54.269 --> 03:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
question is about procedurally because
 
03:14:56.590 --> 03:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
there is also another amendment and I'm
 
03:14:58.950 --> 03:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
curious if we are able to entertain more
 
03:15:00.990 --> 03:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
than one Amendment at the same time I
 
03:15:03.309 --> 03:15:03.319 align:start position:0%
know we've had circumstances believe we
 
03:15:06.229 --> 03:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
have to look at the amendment before us
 
03:15:09.269 --> 03:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh and make a motion accordingly I would
 
03:15:11.950 --> 03:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
allow the other amendment to be
 
03:15:14.429 --> 03:15:14.439 align:start position:0%
distributed so you could look at that
 
03:15:17.269 --> 03:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
but we have to dispose of this motion of
 
03:15:22.070 --> 03:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
art to pass with Amendment 695 before we
 
03:15:25.150 --> 03:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
would consider another one so uh
 
03:15:27.550 --> 03:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
representative Greg if you have copies
 
03:15:29.630 --> 03:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
of your Amendment or do
 
03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
we it has it's representative Raymond
 
03:15:35.950 --> 03:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
and patrino and Greg so if you want to
 
03:15:37.790 --> 03:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
take a look at that and do a side by
 
03:15:40.670 --> 03:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
side both of these will be relatively
 
03:15:45.269 --> 03:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
new to many of us um and go from there
 
03:15:47.630 --> 03:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
but we do are we able to note that the
 
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
amendment uh from representative Raymond
 
03:15:52.110 --> 03:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
is actually uh mirrored from the Senate
 
03:15:54.229 --> 03:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 72 that just passed through their
 
03:15:57.150 --> 03:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
committee uh I Would S yeah yeah we can
 
03:15:57.160 --> 03:15:59.870 align:start position:0%
committee uh I Would S yeah yeah we can

03:15:59.870 --> 03:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:05.189 --> 03:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:07.349 --> 03:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
it I have an
 
03:16:10.510 --> 03:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
extra and representative Greg I only
 
03:16:12.670 --> 03:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
heard part of what you said what is this
 
03:16:14.910 --> 03:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
amendment from Ray representative raym
 
03:16:18.150 --> 03:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 72 their parental Bill of Rights
 
03:16:20.189 --> 03:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
hb7 s
 
03:16:23.510 --> 03:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
sp72 the Senate and how did that turn
 
03:16:28.030 --> 03:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:30.110 --> 03:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
committee all
 
03:16:32.990 --> 03:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
right yep have they voted on it on the
 
03:16:34.670 --> 03:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
floor yet not on the floor yet not on
 
03:16:36.309 --> 03:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
the floor just how did it come out of
 
03:16:38.590 --> 03:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
committee Senator it's Senator Langs Bel
 
03:16:40.469 --> 03:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
it came out of committee
 
03:16:44.150 --> 03:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
21 um p uh Senator long had some
 
03:16:46.550 --> 03:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
quibbles with clear and convincing as
 
03:16:49.030 --> 03:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
these standard of proof uh because that
 
03:16:51.830 --> 03:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
is not the standard of proof in the uh
 
03:16:54.590 --> 03:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
child protective act so we we left that
 
03:16:56.110 --> 03:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
you need evidence and we just crossed
 
03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
out clear and convincing the only other
 
03:17:02.150 --> 03:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
change to Senate Bill 72 was
 
03:17:05.150 --> 03:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
aligning sometimes it said a minor child
 
03:17:06.830 --> 03:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes it said their minor child
 
03:17:08.870 --> 03:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes it said his or her we simply
 
03:17:11.189 --> 03:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
changed all of those to his or her minor
 
03:17:14.229 --> 03:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
child so that they were all the same
 
03:17:18.229 --> 03:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
yeah it was not controversial
 
03:17:22.150 --> 03:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
just stylistic R thank you Mr chair um I
 
03:17:24.990 --> 03:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
noted that in representative Raymond's
 
03:17:27.429 --> 03:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment and representative D Simon's
 
03:17:30.389 --> 03:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
amend uh and and the original bill it
 
03:17:33.110 --> 03:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
defines parent as parent means a person
 
03:17:35.510 --> 03:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
who is legal custody of a minor child as
 
03:17:38.070 --> 03:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
a natural or adoptive parent or legal
 
03:17:41.910 --> 03:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
guardian but in representative D Simon's
 
03:17:44.429 --> 03:17:44.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment it defines it as parent means
 
03:17:46.870 --> 03:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
a person who is the legal natural or
 
03:17:50.670 --> 03:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
adoptive parent of a minor child and I
 
03:17:53.150 --> 03:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
know I wasn't here for the hearing but I
 
03:17:56.469 --> 03:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
I don't know what legal natural
 
03:17:58.950 --> 03:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
means that seems like that's a change
 
03:18:00.510 --> 03:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
from the original Bill okay
 
03:18:02.990 --> 03:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative rights to that point okay
 
03:18:05.150 --> 03:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
anybody to this point if anybody knows
 
03:18:05.160 --> 03:18:06.269 align:start position:0%
anybody to this point if anybody knows
representative

03:18:06.269 --> 03:18:06.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:18:11.590 --> 03:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
deimon the point to uh the legal natural
 
03:18:15.469 --> 03:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
or adoptive parent is made because you
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
can be a bi logical parent and have your
 
03:18:25.189 --> 03:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:29.389 --> 03:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
law uh follow up so is that is that term
 
03:18:33.030 --> 03:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
legal natural defined as that as such in
 
03:18:35.670 --> 03:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
in another area statute or in in this
 
03:18:37.510 --> 03:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
area it will
 
03:18:40.750 --> 03:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
be okay but it's not in the amendment
 
03:18:43.630 --> 03:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
the legal natural no ma'am okay thank
 
03:18:45.870 --> 03:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
you so I mean to me that's a flaw of the
 
03:18:47.429 --> 03:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
amendment because we're using a term
 
03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's not defined thank you for your
 
03:18:53.990 --> 03:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
opinion representative rice thank you Mr
 
03:18:56.070 --> 03:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and with all due respect to my
 
03:18:58.870 --> 03:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues across the aisle I'm not sure
 
03:19:00.910 --> 03:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
why we're amending a Senate bill that we
 
03:19:03.150 --> 03:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
haven't seen yet if that's something
 
03:19:04.990 --> 03:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done when when that
 
03:19:07.429 --> 03:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill comes to us then I would say
 
03:19:09.990 --> 03:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
we would address it but to amend the
 
03:19:13.510 --> 03:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
house version to match a Senate bill um
 
03:19:16.950 --> 03:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
seems redundant almost
 
03:19:19.830 --> 03:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
I'm it has been offered as a legal house
 
03:19:22.269 --> 03:19:22.279 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill where they get
 
03:19:26.269 --> 03:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
their languages is not the point so in
 
03:19:30.030 --> 03:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
your opinion no representative Raymond I
 
03:19:31.429 --> 03:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
would suggest that sometimes what
 
03:19:33.750 --> 03:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
happens when we have competing bills on
 
03:19:37.070 --> 03:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
both sides of um the state house is that
 
03:19:39.510 --> 03:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
we end up having two different things
 
03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
that pass that don't match each other
 
03:19:43.030 --> 03:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
and then we have to have a committee of
 
03:19:46.189 --> 03:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
conference by aligning our bills at an
 
03:19:50.229 --> 03:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
earli level we avoid that unnecessary
 
03:19:52.790 --> 03:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
delay especially if we agree in
 
03:19:55.429 --> 03:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
principle on the matter at hand which is
 
03:19:57.630 --> 03:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
that parents have rights and they should
 
03:20:00.389 --> 03:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
be collected in a convenient location um
 
03:20:03.110 --> 03:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
what the Senate did uh that is different
 
03:20:05.070 --> 03:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
than what the house bill did was the
 
03:20:07.469 --> 03:20:07.479 align:start position:0%
Senate did not take up medical records
 
03:20:09.710 --> 03:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
in this um personally I like that
 
03:20:12.750 --> 03:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
because we have HB 560 before us this
 
03:20:16.229 --> 03:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
afternoon which only considers medical
 
03:20:17.950 --> 03:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
so this would be parents rights and
 
03:20:19.830 --> 03:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
education and then there would be a
 
03:20:22.269 --> 03:20:22.279 align:start position:0%
separate bill for parents rights with
 
03:20:26.110 --> 03:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
medical um and again the who want to
 
03:20:29.469 --> 03:20:29.479 align:start position:0%
raise productive members of
 
03:20:32.150 --> 03:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
society and have the rights to
 
03:20:36.030 --> 03:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
information in order to support the way
 
03:20:39.670 --> 03:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
they want to raise those children
 
03:20:43.229 --> 03:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
or educate those children I think this
 
03:20:45.710 --> 03:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
amendment speaks to all of that and I
 
03:20:51.469 --> 03:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
think that this Amendment um speaks to
 
03:20:56.710 --> 03:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
the uh 13 other states that already
 
03:21:00.870 --> 03:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
have uh a bill such as this and the 32
 
03:21:04.269 --> 03:21:04.279 align:start position:0%
pending legislations in 32 other
 
03:21:08.910 --> 03:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
states that is similar to this language
 
03:21:11.550 --> 03:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
so I think that New Hampshire being the
 
03:21:14.670 --> 03:21:14.680 align:start position:0%
kind of a state that promotes healthy
 
03:21:17.349 --> 03:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
families and healthy parents and more
 
03:21:21.550 --> 03:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
importantly healthy productive children
 
03:21:25.070 --> 03:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment I'm hoping uh that you
 
03:21:29.349 --> 03:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
would understand its necessity and vote
 
03:21:34.790 --> 03:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:37.590 --> 03:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
chairman representative
 
03:21:43.349 --> 03:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
coren thank you Mr chairman um so I love
 
03:21:46.830 --> 03:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
hb10 as you amended it um I think think
 
03:21:49.349 --> 03:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
it is more inclusive and more
 
03:21:52.910 --> 03:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
encompassing than the amendment from
 
03:21:56.269 --> 03:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond um one thing that
 
03:21:58.950 --> 03:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
that I love about your amendment is that
 
03:22:01.389 --> 03:22:01.399 align:start position:0%
it includes the health care
 
03:22:04.269 --> 03:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
practitioners um I think that as far as
 
03:22:07.710 --> 03:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
the parents that I talk to um they are
 
03:22:10.309 --> 03:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
worried about all of their parental
 
03:22:13.349 --> 03:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
rights so I do like that this bill talks
 
03:22:16.630 --> 03:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
about that as well um in the in just
 
03:22:18.990 --> 03:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
glancing at this amendment from
 
03:22:21.469 --> 03:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond patrino and and
 
03:22:25.870 --> 03:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
Greg um their amend their Amendment
 
03:22:29.510 --> 03:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:33.389 --> 03:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
school or gives medical providers and
 
03:22:36.910 --> 03:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
out for H for um answering to a parent
 
03:22:41.510 --> 03:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
um so I think that hb10 as written and
 
03:22:48.189 --> 03:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:50.469 --> 03:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
before lunch representative Markel
 
03:22:52.389 --> 03:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
showed me a document it's the upto-date
 
03:22:55.469 --> 03:22:55.479 align:start position:0%
parenting plan and he showed it to me in
 
03:22:59.870 --> 03:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
part because he was noting how the bill
 
03:23:02.510 --> 03:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh and Amendment before us uh track ever
 
03:23:03.950 --> 03:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
so well with it would you care to speak
 
03:23:05.389 --> 03:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
to that
 
03:23:07.870 --> 03:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
sir yes certainly Mr chairman and thank
 
03:23:10.550 --> 03:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to address the
 
03:23:13.349 --> 03:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
issue one of the things that comes out
 
03:23:15.590 --> 03:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
in parenting plans which are part and
 
03:23:18.510 --> 03:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
parcel of either unmarried parents
 
03:23:21.189 --> 03:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
filing parent petitions in court dealing
 
03:23:23.950 --> 03:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
with their children or divorcing married
 
03:23:26.349 --> 03:23:26.359 align:start position:0%
parents uh who also have to have
 
03:23:28.790 --> 03:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
parenting plans in the required pursuant
 
03:23:28.800 --> 03:23:30.309 align:start position:0%
parenting plans in the required pursuant
RSA

03:23:30.309 --> 03:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
03:23:32.950 --> 03:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
461a one of the things that they do is
 
03:23:34.870 --> 03:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
they include language in there about
 
03:23:38.990 --> 03:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
information access and sharing and the
 
03:23:41.630 --> 03:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
basically what the courts are saying is
 
03:23:43.110 --> 03:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
that you
 
03:23:46.790 --> 03:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
have the rights to to basically the
 
03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
information that
 
03:23:52.110 --> 03:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
um that are being identified for the
 
03:23:56.670 --> 03:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
most part in um in hb10 the amended
 
03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
version that we see here um 20250
 
03:24:04.510 --> 03:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
69h uh so when we look at that that
 
03:24:07.670 --> 03:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
basically tracks it it summarizes it so
 
03:24:09.630 --> 03:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
it's kind of interesting because what
 
03:24:12.070 --> 03:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
the parenting plans are actually saying
 
03:24:15.510 --> 03:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
is these are the rights you have uh so
 
03:24:18.269 --> 03:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
this this bill actually puts parents on
 
03:24:20.070 --> 03:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
notice what they would actually be
 
03:24:22.510 --> 03:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
getting if they're not in that situation
 
03:24:24.349 --> 03:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
to begin with and have to go to court to
 
03:24:27.309 --> 03:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
figure it out so I think that's
 
03:24:30.750 --> 03:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
important um as it and by way of just
 
03:24:34.670 --> 03:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
closing comment on it is is that
 
03:24:37.349 --> 03:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
parenting Liberty interests that you
 
03:24:41.110 --> 03:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
have under us uh constit under the
 
03:24:44.030 --> 03:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
federal con under the Constitution as
 
03:24:46.070 --> 03:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution as interpreted by
 
03:24:48.550 --> 03:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court and under the New
 
03:24:51.110 --> 03:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution as interpreted by
 
03:24:53.469 --> 03:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court are that
 
03:24:55.349 --> 03:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
you have a fundamental liberty interest
 
03:24:57.110 --> 03:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
in raising your children and directing
 
03:25:00.990 --> 03:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
their care education and so forth
 
03:25:04.030 --> 03:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
um however the one the limiting factors
 
03:25:07.189 --> 03:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
are when you go to court or for example
 
03:25:08.830 --> 03:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
when you go to court and either invite
 
03:25:11.309 --> 03:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
the state in which you do either by
 
03:25:13.790 --> 03:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
filing a petition for divorce or
 
03:25:17.910 --> 03:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
voluntarily inviting the state in by um
 
03:25:19.870 --> 03:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
filing a parenting petition in the case
 
03:25:23.469 --> 03:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
of people who aren't married or are you
 
03:25:25.590 --> 03:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
involuntarily uh are subject to the
 
03:25:28.110 --> 03:25:28.120 align:start position:0%
state's uh competing interest by
 
03:25:30.110 --> 03:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
engaging in Acts that are abusive or
 
03:25:33.349 --> 03:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
neglectful of your children so this I
 
03:25:36.189 --> 03:25:36.199 align:start position:0%
think serves as a good model and uh to
 
03:25:38.070 --> 03:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
sum it up it's certainly something I
 
03:25:38.080 --> 03:25:39.030 align:start position:0%
sum it up it's certainly something I
would

03:25:39.030 --> 03:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:25:41.070 --> 03:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
support thank you for allowing me to
 
03:25:44.070 --> 03:25:44.080 align:start position:0%

Amendment

03:25:56.750 --> 03:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:25:58.710 --> 03:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
0699 any
 
03:26:01.910 --> 03:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Greg thank
 
03:26:03.710 --> 03:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman specifically on page
 
03:26:08.950 --> 03:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
four of of the uh dmon Amendment uh the
 
03:26:12.229 --> 03:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
most recent one page four
 
03:26:16.950 --> 03:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
um lines 17 and 18 um if you remember so
 
03:26:21.469 --> 03:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
this did not change I asked in our um
 
03:26:24.510 --> 03:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
our session on this particularly if this
 
03:26:27.309 --> 03:26:27.319 align:start position:0%
was just for public schools if that W
 
03:26:28.990 --> 03:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
and they they said that this was
 
03:26:31.269 --> 03:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
intended for all schools so I'm just
 
03:26:33.349 --> 03:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
wondering when we still on line 17 and
 
03:26:35.790 --> 03:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
18 have the right of a parent to inspect
 
03:26:37.870 --> 03:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
School District instructional materials
 
03:26:40.630 --> 03:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
once again this opens this up for any
 
03:26:43.830 --> 03:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
parent to go after any school including
 
03:26:47.229 --> 03:26:47.239 align:start position:0%
the home schools including the um um
 
03:26:48.990 --> 03:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
private schools and say because it
 
03:26:51.550 --> 03:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify the parent of a child in
 
03:26:54.349 --> 03:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
that school we now open this up we do
 
03:26:55.710 --> 03:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
know that we have people that have
 
03:26:57.389 --> 03:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
traveled to every school board in the
 
03:26:59.990 --> 03:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
state to request information and stuff
 
03:27:03.750 --> 03:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
so this is once again a huge um thing
 
03:27:05.510 --> 03:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
that I I am worried about because this
 
03:27:08.830 --> 03:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
opens it up to any any of these for any
 
03:27:10.710 --> 03:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
parent to do it I'm a parent I could
 
03:27:12.910 --> 03:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
certainly go up to any of the private
 
03:27:15.070 --> 03:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
schools that even our um own
 
03:27:17.429 --> 03:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
Representatives have and request
 
03:27:20.469 --> 03:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
documentation so that's a
 
03:27:23.110 --> 03:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
worry may I speak to that uh
 
03:27:25.630 --> 03:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
representative deimon to respond thank
 
03:27:29.309 --> 03:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
you uh this I specifically put in here
 
03:27:29.319 --> 03:27:30.670 align:start position:0%
you uh this I specifically put in here
School

03:27:30.670 --> 03:27:30.680 align:start position:0%
School
 
03:27:33.910 --> 03:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
District um because whether it be
 
03:27:33.920 --> 03:27:35.469 align:start position:0%
District um because whether it be
homeschool

03:27:35.469 --> 03:27:35.479 align:start position:0%
homeschool
 
03:27:38.630 --> 03:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
or any other type of school in the
 
03:27:43.710 --> 03:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
district the district makes the
 
03:27:47.309 --> 03:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
determination um of the instructional
 
03:27:50.630 --> 03:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
materials and quite frankly if a parent
 
03:27:53.710 --> 03:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
is searching for a new home and is
 
03:27:56.469 --> 03:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
leaving one school district and going to
 
03:27:58.590 --> 03:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
another school district that parent
 
03:28:02.070 --> 03:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
should have the right to
 
03:28:06.790 --> 03:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
um uh inspect that school's School
 
03:28:10.670 --> 03:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
District's uh instructional materials to
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that if they do move to that
 
03:28:16.309 --> 03:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
District it is a school that would be a
 
03:28:19.269 --> 03:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
good fit for their family so I
 
03:28:21.630 --> 03:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
specifically did
 
03:28:26.670 --> 03:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
not go any deeper than that follow
 
03:28:29.429 --> 03:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
followup so then um it's fair to say we
 
03:28:32.070 --> 03:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
are only um making sure that parents
 
03:28:35.389 --> 03:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
have rights in public schools is that
 
03:28:38.269 --> 03:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
correct public or private depending upon
 
03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:52.910 --> 03:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:55.630 --> 03:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
she's confused too there is a epidemic
 
03:28:58.349 --> 03:28:58.359 align:start position:0%
of confusion here anybody who's not
 
03:29:00.150 --> 03:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
confused who would like to speak it's in
 
03:29:03.110 --> 03:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
the water I do it is not in the
 
03:29:05.510 --> 03:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
water representative coren for the
 
03:29:08.950 --> 03:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
rescue yes um thank you chairman um
 
03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
don't we as taxpayers have a right to go
 
03:29:14.110 --> 03:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
to a school district and ask for
 
03:29:17.590 --> 03:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum anyway yes and and um if
 
03:29:19.790 --> 03:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
you're considering putting your child
 
03:29:21.229 --> 03:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
into a private
 
03:29:23.910 --> 03:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
school I don't know of any that would
 
03:29:26.550 --> 03:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
withhold their curriculum from a parent
 
03:29:28.550 --> 03:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
who was interested in sending their
 
03:29:33.710 --> 03:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:36.030 --> 03:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
neither anyone else with a hand up
 
03:29:38.830 --> 03:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
representative Rong thank you Mr
 
03:29:42.150 --> 03:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
chairman um I mean aside from the
 
03:29:43.790 --> 03:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
problem with the defin lack of
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
definition the one thing I would love to
 
03:29:48.349 --> 03:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
see in this amendment the and the other
 
03:29:50.750 --> 03:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
amendment in the Bill is talk more about
 
03:29:50.760 --> 03:29:51.990 align:start position:0%
amendment in the Bill is talk more about
parents

03:29:51.990 --> 03:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
parents
 
03:29:54.110 --> 03:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities certainly they have a
 
03:29:57.189 --> 03:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
right and expectation to participate in
 
03:29:59.110 --> 03:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
the selection of approval of academic
 
03:30:00.710 --> 03:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
standards but I think they have a
 
03:30:04.389 --> 03:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility too I know it's not going
 
03:30:07.229 --> 03:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
to be in here but I mean just from the
 
03:30:08.910 --> 03:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard this morning
 
03:30:11.870 --> 03:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
regarding child abuse it seems that we
 
03:30:14.349 --> 03:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
need parents to take as much
 
03:30:17.670 --> 03:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility as they do rights so
 
03:30:21.950 --> 03:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:25.269 --> 03:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
you you may respond thank you Mr
 
03:30:28.189 --> 03:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
chairman on uh the very first page under
 
03:30:29.830 --> 03:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
parental rights and
 
03:30:31.990 --> 03:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities it says they shall have
 
03:30:34.950 --> 03:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
the same meaning as care custody control
 
03:30:37.349 --> 03:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
and shall include parenting time
 
03:30:39.349 --> 03:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking and residential
 
03:30:42.110 --> 03:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility parents for whom such
 
03:30:45.469 --> 03:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
rights to care custody or control of a
 
03:30:45.479 --> 03:30:46.429 align:start position:0%
rights to care custody or control of a
child

03:30:46.429 --> 03:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:30:50.590 --> 03:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
have been Abridged halted modified or
 
03:30:52.269 --> 03:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
suspended and shall have their rights
 
03:30:54.990 --> 03:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
restored upon showing a preponderance of
 
03:30:57.269 --> 03:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
the evidence that is in the best
 
03:30:58.790 --> 03:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
interest of the
 
03:31:02.110 --> 03:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
child I felt that that definition was
 
03:31:07.389 --> 03:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
enough to um enter into the Bill of
 
03:31:11.150 --> 03:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
Rights to state that the
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
parents shall parent their child
 
03:31:18.429 --> 03:31:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:22.510 --> 03:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
followup y uh thank you Mr chairman yeah
 
03:31:24.990 --> 03:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
I I just think that in I mean this is a
 
03:31:27.229 --> 03:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
long document and I think that one
 
03:31:31.030 --> 03:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
section isn't conveyed I think in in my
 
03:31:31.040 --> 03:31:32.790 align:start position:0%
section isn't conveyed I think in in my
opinion

03:31:32.790 --> 03:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
03:31:37.349 --> 03:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
to to communicate the important and the
 
03:31:39.630 --> 03:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
vital role parents have in being
 
03:31:42.790 --> 03:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
responsible parents um I mean I look
 
03:31:45.110 --> 03:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
through this I've raised three children
 
03:31:48.469 --> 03:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
I've always had these rights but what
 
03:31:50.950 --> 03:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
bothers me is we talk a lot about rights
 
03:31:52.950 --> 03:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
of parents and I think sometimes we
 
03:31:55.110 --> 03:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
don't set the expectation of their
 
03:31:56.990 --> 03:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility and in some of these
 
03:31:59.469 --> 03:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
things particularly in in accessing
 
03:32:02.429 --> 03:32:02.439 align:start position:0%
their medical records um working with
 
03:32:05.349 --> 03:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
their schools they have a responsibility
 
03:32:08.990 --> 03:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
I once talked to a father who four or
 
03:32:10.550 --> 03:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
five months into the school year didn't
 
03:32:12.429 --> 03:32:12.439 align:start position:0%
even know the building where his child
 
03:32:15.150 --> 03:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
went to school um I consider that
 
03:32:15.160 --> 03:32:16.750 align:start position:0%
went to school um I consider that
irresponsible

03:32:16.750 --> 03:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
irresponsible
 
03:32:19.469 --> 03:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
um it is it illegal no it there's not
 
03:32:20.910 --> 03:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
going to be anything we find in law that
 
03:32:22.790 --> 03:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
makes that illegal but I think if we're
 
03:32:25.670 --> 03:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
going to establish rights we need to put
 
03:32:27.269 --> 03:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
equal weight into
 
03:32:30.150 --> 03:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility thank you as I've often
 
03:32:32.469 --> 03:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
said um I have been accused on some
 
03:32:34.590 --> 03:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
occasions of packing too much into a
 
03:32:37.229 --> 03:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
bill that it should be clean and simple
 
03:32:39.150 --> 03:32:39.160 align:start position:0%
on one topic if I have more things to
 
03:32:41.870 --> 03:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
say file another bill and I've been conf
 
03:32:45.189 --> 03:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh accused of the direct opposite so uh
 
03:32:46.990 --> 03:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
this is the bill we're dealing with
 
03:32:49.950 --> 03:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
these things representative George thank
 
03:32:53.590 --> 03:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
you chair U Mr chairman um I'm a little
 
03:32:55.429 --> 03:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
bit concerned because I saw just a
 
03:32:58.269 --> 03:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
little bit I've been in school board and
 
03:33:00.150 --> 03:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
I know what's going inside the school
 
03:33:02.150 --> 03:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
with the teachers with the kids and a
 
03:33:05.950 --> 03:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
parent and uh I see lot of parent who
 
03:33:09.309 --> 03:33:09.319 align:start position:0%
always just sue the school or some
 
03:33:11.670 --> 03:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
sometime the the kids doesn't even
 
03:33:14.349 --> 03:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
respect the teacher because the parent
 
03:33:16.389 --> 03:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
always be over
 
03:33:21.269 --> 03:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
everything um I think so uh we gave it
 
03:33:25.229 --> 03:33:25.239 align:start position:0%
just more parent but we don't talk about
 
03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
how is going to be the relationship for
 
03:33:28.750 --> 03:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
the kids and the the teacher and the
 
03:33:31.429 --> 03:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
parents for this bill because this is a
 
03:33:34.269 --> 03:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
very important for
 
03:33:37.630 --> 03:33:37.640 align:start position:0%
me representative Greg thank you Mr
 
03:33:39.910 --> 03:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
chairman um one other concern that I
 
03:33:43.269 --> 03:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
have is on page two line
 
03:33:46.510 --> 03:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
25 it specifies that access review to
 
03:33:49.030 --> 03:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
all medical records um dot dot dot um
 
03:33:50.510 --> 03:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
the parent is the subject of an
 
03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
investigation of a crime committed
 
03:33:54.870 --> 03:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
against the minor child we do know in
 
03:33:57.469 --> 03:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
this particular committee that when
 
03:34:00.269 --> 03:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
somebody is under investigation uh about
 
03:34:02.229 --> 03:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
child abuse it's not under investigation
 
03:34:05.590 --> 03:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
of a crime so many of many of our child
 
03:34:07.550 --> 03:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
abuse situations certainly when we're
 
03:34:09.309 --> 03:34:09.319 align:start position:0%
trying to get interventions for parents
 
03:34:12.110 --> 03:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
and stuff are within the Civil Court I
 
03:34:15.070 --> 03:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
certainly know that um in my own
 
03:34:17.269 --> 03:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
personal EXP experience when my late
 
03:34:20.070 --> 03:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
husband was being investigated and our
 
03:34:23.150 --> 03:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
our situation was such that we were
 
03:34:26.349 --> 03:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
separated for six months he was trying
 
03:34:28.670 --> 03:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
to get the medical records we were able
 
03:34:30.309 --> 03:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure that he couldn't he wanted
 
03:34:32.830 --> 03:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
to see what had been turned in and in
 
03:34:35.510 --> 03:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
hindsight it was to to bolster his
 
03:34:37.269 --> 03:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
criminal case when that got filed but
 
03:34:39.990 --> 03:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
that is certainly a consideration so
 
03:34:42.070 --> 03:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
just saying that investigation of a
 
03:34:43.910 --> 03:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
crime committed that's that's pretty
 
03:34:45.710 --> 03:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
hard to prove and that's not always
 
03:34:47.590 --> 03:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
what's going on in abusive cases
 
03:34:49.710 --> 03:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it is just not in the
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
criminal it takes a lot to get it into
 
03:34:53.309 --> 03:34:53.319 align:start position:0%
the criminal court so especially when we
 
03:34:55.229 --> 03:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
need interventions but it doesn't mean
 
03:34:57.510 --> 03:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
those parents should be able to access
 
03:35:00.150 --> 03:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
that medical
 
03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
reporting representative Mar thank you
 
03:35:05.030 --> 03:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman for allowing me to address
 
03:35:07.910 --> 03:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
your concerns uh when that was written
 
03:35:09.830 --> 03:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of things that need to
 
03:35:12.510 --> 03:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
be award need to be looked at when we're
 
03:35:14.550 --> 03:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
talking about privilege and when we're
 
03:35:17.349 --> 03:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
talking about medical records and people
 
03:35:20.670 --> 03:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
who treat uh adolescents or other
 
03:35:22.910 --> 03:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
children there's there's some research
 
03:35:26.469 --> 03:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
that went into this okay first if
 
03:35:29.790 --> 03:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
there's going to be Al there's the Civil
 
03:35:32.150 --> 03:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
aspects of it and then what you're
 
03:35:35.150 --> 03:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
talking about might be criminal okay as
 
03:35:38.910 --> 03:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
a general as a general proposition uh
 
03:35:41.389 --> 03:35:41.399 align:start position:0%
you have a right under under under
 
03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
basically under the federal and state
 
03:35:44.990 --> 03:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
constitution you have a right to see
 
03:35:46.950 --> 03:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
evidence uh that's going to be
 
03:35:48.950 --> 03:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
introduced against you you know for
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
example people who commit horrific
 
03:35:53.950 --> 03:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
crimes particularly against children
 
03:35:55.469 --> 03:35:55.479 align:start position:0%
that evidence is going to have a right
 
03:35:57.229 --> 03:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
to be challenged so it wouldn't be
 
03:36:00.550 --> 03:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
withheld it would be unlikely to be
 
03:36:03.349 --> 03:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
withheld in the criminal context now
 
03:36:05.590 --> 03:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
addressing the Civil context which is
 
03:36:07.630 --> 03:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
where I think you're going with this is
 
03:36:09.630 --> 03:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
that your is that your real
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
question can I can I answer so
 
03:36:14.630 --> 03:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
specifically on letter H so if you look
 
03:36:17.269 --> 03:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
at line 23 so that's where this so this
 
03:36:19.189 --> 03:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
is for a parent because we're talking
 
03:36:21.189 --> 03:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
about parents rights only in this access
 
03:36:23.189 --> 03:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
and review to all medical records as the
 
03:36:24.750 --> 03:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
personal representatives of their
 
03:36:28.469 --> 03:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
children there are many parents who um
 
03:36:31.710 --> 03:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason are not necessarily
 
03:36:33.590 --> 03:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
their parental rights have not been
 
03:36:36.030 --> 03:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
terminated and stuff but they are
 
03:36:38.309 --> 03:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
separated from their children because of
 
03:36:39.750 --> 03:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
allegations it doesn't mean that they're
 
03:36:42.830 --> 03:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
under criminal investigation correct so
 
03:36:44.830 --> 03:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
that's what I was asking if thank you Mr
 
03:36:47.469 --> 03:36:47.479 align:start position:0%
chairman for me to address that see so
 
03:36:49.309 --> 03:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
what happens if you go into the Civil
 
03:36:51.389 --> 03:36:51.399 align:start position:0%
context which is where I think you were
 
03:36:53.550 --> 03:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
going with this is is that there's
 
03:36:55.870 --> 03:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
already case law on point uh I think
 
03:36:57.870 --> 03:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
we've brought it up before but for a
 
03:37:00.550 --> 03:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
good a good one to look at is in reberg
 
03:37:02.229 --> 03:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
okay which is a New Hampshire Supreme
 
03:37:05.070 --> 03:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
Court case from 2005 where in the middle
 
03:37:07.910 --> 03:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
of a rather contentious divorce hearing
 
03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh the Supreme Court and this case went
 
03:37:13.750 --> 03:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
up to the Supreme Court which said that
 
03:37:16.229 --> 03:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
basically privileged records that
 
03:37:18.550 --> 03:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
children particularly out of
 
03:37:22.670 --> 03:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
particularly with uh psychiatric records
 
03:37:24.790 --> 03:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
or those kinds of things do have
 
03:37:27.510 --> 03:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
standing to have a privilege asserted
 
03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay now if you're in that kind of
 
03:37:33.670 --> 03:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
contentious position all right then
 
03:37:36.070 --> 03:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
somebody is going to have to go to court
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
and prevent you from getting those
 
03:37:40.309 --> 03:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
records and that's always almost always
 
03:37:43.710 --> 03:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
going to be fact dependent okay so you
 
03:37:46.550 --> 03:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
know almost always I can't see a
 
03:37:48.269 --> 03:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
situation where it wouldn't be this
 
03:37:50.070 --> 03:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
would be under normal
 
03:37:52.389 --> 03:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh so what you actually
 
03:37:54.830 --> 03:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
are doing here is balancing the rights
 
03:37:57.510 --> 03:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
of a patient okay against the right of a
 
03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
parent so for example when personal
 
03:38:03.510 --> 03:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
representatives for example my research
 
03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
shows that personal Representatives
 
03:38:09.510 --> 03:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
under hip ah okay uh actually have the
 
03:38:12.469 --> 03:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
same standing as the patient themselves
 
03:38:15.150 --> 03:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to get records now if we're
 
03:38:18.790 --> 03:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
talking about abuse or neglect or if
 
03:38:20.550 --> 03:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about allegations where
 
03:38:23.389 --> 03:38:23.399 align:start position:0%
there are serious
 
03:38:26.349 --> 03:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
problems and somebody wants records and
 
03:38:28.110 --> 03:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
they want them for some nefarious
 
03:38:30.510 --> 03:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
purpose you know then there's room for
 
03:38:33.710 --> 03:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
intervention so this balances the rights
 
03:38:37.070 --> 03:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
of you may this balances the rights of
 
03:38:38.950 --> 03:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
parents and the rights of patients to
 
03:38:41.150 --> 03:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
have their rights protected you know
 
03:38:43.269 --> 03:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
people may disagree on that but the
 
03:38:44.830 --> 03:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
point of it is that's what I think it
 
03:38:49.150 --> 03:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:51.790 --> 03:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
chairman um so I want to go back to page
 
03:38:56.790 --> 03:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
six uh page
 
03:39:00.030 --> 03:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
five um at the bottom Roman numeral 2
 
03:39:00.040 --> 03:39:01.590 align:start position:0%
five um at the bottom Roman numeral 2
line

03:39:01.590 --> 03:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:39:04.229 --> 03:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
23 um it says except is otherwise
 
03:39:05.630 --> 03:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
provided by law or core order a health
 
03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
provider shall not allow a medical
 
03:39:08.710 --> 03:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
procedure to be performed on a minor
 
03:39:10.469 --> 03:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
child in its facilities without first
 
03:39:13.150 --> 03:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
obtaining written parental consent I
 
03:39:16.429 --> 03:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
want to know where the exception is for
 
03:39:19.110 --> 03:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
emergency situations um I'm thinking
 
03:39:21.189 --> 03:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
about our dear friend and colleague
 
03:39:22.950 --> 03:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
whose child was injured at school and
 
03:39:26.710 --> 03:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
needed immediate emergent treatment
 
03:39:28.910 --> 03:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
before she was physically present and
 
03:39:31.510 --> 03:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
able to sign a consent now there are
 
03:39:33.750 --> 03:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
other laws allowing those things but
 
03:39:36.070 --> 03:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
would this require both parents to be
 
03:39:38.830 --> 03:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
there what if only one parent can be
 
03:39:42.030 --> 03:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
there how is this going to impact the
 
03:39:45.750 --> 03:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
daily routine parenting of people where
 
03:39:48.830 --> 03:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
we frequently when you have two parents
 
03:39:51.189 --> 03:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
tag off on who's going to do this
 
03:39:53.550 --> 03:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
appointment and who's going to do that
 
03:39:57.150 --> 03:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
appointment what if one parent
 
03:39:59.510 --> 03:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
objects I believe the operative phrase
 
03:40:05.550 --> 03:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
in 1923 and 26 is uh or excuse me uh 19
 
03:40:08.590 --> 03:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
and 23 is except as otherwise provided
 
03:40:10.830 --> 03:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
by law and I'm wondering if our resident
 
03:40:14.030 --> 03:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
lawyer could expand on that uh thank you
 
03:40:15.870 --> 03:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes I can
 
03:40:18.550 --> 03:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh other statutes provide for you can
 
03:40:20.429 --> 03:40:20.439 align:start position:0%
dispense with consent for emergency
 
03:40:22.429 --> 03:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
medical treatment okay so that's as
 
03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise provided by law in the case of
 
03:40:27.349 --> 03:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
Waring parents where they are just at
 
03:40:30.110 --> 03:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
loggerheads what this requires simply is
 
03:40:33.429 --> 03:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
parental consent okay so if one parent
 
03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
consents then that's enough uh and if
 
03:40:38.309 --> 03:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to go to court and then if
 
03:40:40.590 --> 03:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
a parent is wor and we see these
 
03:40:42.790 --> 03:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
conflicts all the time in court and that
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
if if a parent is either going to be
 
03:40:49.349 --> 03:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
orang y or just contentious obstructive
 
03:40:52.030 --> 03:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
or engaging in some other conduct which
 
03:40:53.950 --> 03:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
is detrimental to the wellbeing of a
 
03:40:55.469 --> 03:40:55.479 align:start position:0%
child they're going to have to answer
 
03:40:55.479 --> 03:40:57.630 align:start position:0%
child they're going to have to answer
for

03:40:57.630 --> 03:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:41:00.950 --> 03:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
it representative nson thank you Mr
 
03:41:03.389 --> 03:41:03.399 align:start position:0%
chairman um so in the event of an
 
03:41:07.150 --> 03:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
emergency in a school setting on page
 
03:41:09.590 --> 03:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
five line
 
03:41:12.670 --> 03:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
29 uh says this section does not apply
 
03:41:15.950 --> 03:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
to Emergency Services pursuant to RSA
 
03:41:18.910 --> 03:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
1538 col 18 so I think that that would
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:26.080 align:start position:0%

amendment thank you Mr chairman I think
 
03:45:04.349 --> 03:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
that um I'm trying to decide if it's
 
03:45:07.670 --> 03:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
worth moving the amendment to have it
 
03:45:12.269 --> 03:45:12.279 align:start position:0%
fail 7 to9 or if it's worth calling it a
 
03:45:13.349 --> 03:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
day on this
 
03:45:15.990 --> 03:45:16.000 align:start position:0%

03:45:55.680 --> 03:46:43.830 align:start position:0%
 
all

03:46:43.830 --> 03:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:43.840 --> 03:46:45.349 align:start position:0%
 
ch

03:46:45.349 --> 03:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
ch
 
03:46:47.750 --> 03:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think we need to go into
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:43.840 --> 03:48:13.750 align:start position:0%
 
over

03:48:13.750 --> 03:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:13.760 --> 03:48:43.710 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:48:43.710 --> 03:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:23.349 --> 03:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
because this is split normally I would
 
03:49:26.309 --> 03:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
just say our committee because I think
 
03:49:28.590 --> 03:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
that's our power position that we like
 
03:49:31.389 --> 03:49:31.399 align:start position:0%
to do things as a committee as unanimous
 
03:49:33.750 --> 03:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
as possible and that's honestly why we
 
03:49:37.389 --> 03:49:37.399 align:start position:0%
worked on this amendment we understand
 
03:49:41.630 --> 03:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm a mama bear to Full Tilt
 
03:49:43.670 --> 03:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
and to be able to have rights and to
 
03:49:45.309 --> 03:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
always know that I can go to my child's
 
03:49:47.710 --> 03:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
School even if she's in a private school
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
and you know look at the curriculum say
 
03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
that I don't want her anything is
 
03:49:52.670 --> 03:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
incredibly important to me it's
 
03:49:55.349 --> 03:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
incredibly important to all of us um the
 
03:49:57.269 --> 03:49:57.279 align:start position:0%
reason for this amendment is is that we
 
03:50:00.269 --> 03:50:00.279 align:start position:0%
saw issues first of all I see an issue
 
03:50:02.389 --> 03:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
with only targeting kids in public
 
03:50:04.510 --> 03:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
schools and and making parents who are
 
03:50:06.870 --> 03:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
in public schools think that you know
 
03:50:08.309 --> 03:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
they're the only ones that can do that I
 
03:50:10.990 --> 03:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
think that's a problem I also think that
 
03:50:13.990 --> 03:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
um not having menacing situations where
 
03:50:15.710 --> 03:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
we have parents going all over the state
 
03:50:17.550 --> 03:50:17.560 align:start position:0%
although I do understand about the
 
03:50:19.790 --> 03:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
moving and stuff I also you know we
 
03:50:21.269 --> 03:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
looked at this not because we wanted to
 
03:50:23.429 --> 03:50:23.439 align:start position:0%
copy the Senate bill but because we we
 
03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
looked at the sponsors on the Senate
 
03:50:27.349 --> 03:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
Bill we understood that they have the
 
03:50:29.189 --> 03:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
same heart that they would like to see
 
03:50:31.670 --> 03:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
parental rights all in one place we also
 
03:50:33.510 --> 03:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
see that that's a confusion that we
 
03:50:36.149 --> 03:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
continue to hear not that people I think
 
03:50:37.630 --> 03:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
we've talked about it over and over that
 
03:50:39.790 --> 03:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
parents do have rights but the fact that
 
03:50:42.790 --> 03:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's not all in one place that it's not
 
03:50:44.670 --> 03:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
easy for people to see that's a problem
 
03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
problem and we hear that and we want to
 
03:50:50.030 --> 03:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
support that position um in looking at
 
03:50:52.910 --> 03:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill um certainly it was not
 
03:50:56.149 --> 03:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
not a democratic bill but we saw that it
 
03:50:59.389 --> 03:50:59.399 align:start position:0%
had some strengths in it as far as
 
03:51:03.469 --> 03:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
keeping within the legal tone of um what
 
03:51:05.550 --> 03:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
we're looking at specifically about the
 
03:51:09.389 --> 03:51:09.399 align:start position:0%
medical um wanting it not only to
 
03:51:12.790 --> 03:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
they I think the intention is the same
 
03:51:15.429 --> 03:51:15.439 align:start position:0%
but I think I know that they had a care
 
03:51:17.590 --> 03:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
really looking at aligning with the
 
03:51:19.550 --> 03:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
child protection act I think that was a
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
big thing I also think that it was a big
 
03:51:23.229 --> 03:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
deal and I'm probably getting way too
 
03:51:25.389 --> 03:51:25.399 align:start position:0%
wordy but um it was a big deal also to
 
03:51:27.790 --> 03:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
align with federal law as far as the
 
03:51:30.110 --> 03:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
medical part of it um we certainly don't
 
03:51:32.590 --> 03:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
want something that parents are going to
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
think that they have and then federal
 
03:51:35.990 --> 03:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
law is going to pull that back and they
 
03:51:38.469 --> 03:51:38.479 align:start position:0%
don't actually have that so um this
 
03:51:40.590 --> 03:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
amendment really speaks to all of those
 
03:51:42.630 --> 03:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
it also honors the work that we've done
 
03:51:45.149 --> 03:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
on this committee as a full committee
 
03:51:47.469 --> 03:51:47.479 align:start position:0%
and understanding that we are for
 
03:51:50.110 --> 03:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
parental rights and um we know that
 
03:51:51.590 --> 03:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's a need to have it in one place
 
03:51:53.950 --> 03:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
so I I hope that everyone would consider
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
this amendment um I think it's a a
 
03:51:59.349 --> 03:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
strong Amendment and um certainly I
 
03:52:01.870 --> 03:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
think we could get two houses to agree
 
03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
on it thank
 
03:52:07.910 --> 03:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
you I think from my perspective um
 
03:52:10.550 --> 03:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
having sat on many committees of
 
03:52:10.560 --> 03:52:12.229 align:start position:0%
having sat on many committees of
conference

03:52:12.229 --> 03:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
conference
 
03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
um sometimes the good stuff wins out out
 
03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the stuff that we didn't
 
03:52:20.590 --> 03:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
do that they did prevails and we do have
 
03:52:23.469 --> 03:52:23.479 align:start position:0%
another shot at it should this amendment
 
03:52:25.950 --> 03:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
not pass so it's not the end of the road
 
03:52:29.070 --> 03:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
on this and I'm glad you articulated it
 
03:52:30.149 --> 03:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
because I've written some of these
 
03:52:33.469 --> 03:52:33.479 align:start position:0%
things down and should I get get put on
 
03:52:35.790 --> 03:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
um a committee of conference I'll
 
03:52:38.229 --> 03:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
certainly bring our committees at least
 
03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
part of our committee's uh uh thoughts
 
03:52:42.910 --> 03:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
on this anybody
 
03:52:46.149 --> 03:52:46.159 align:start position:0%

03:52:48.429 --> 03:52:48.439 align:start position:0%

03:54:20.189 --> 03:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
representative deimon if you don't have

writing it is just in case and uh
 
03:54:31.870 --> 03:54:31.880 align:start position:0%

03:54:46.750 --> 03:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:49.309 --> 03:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
they may have met in the
 
03:54:52.670 --> 03:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
morning oh they did okay all righty uh
 
03:54:54.910 --> 03:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
what have we not done have we not I got
 
03:55:20.110 --> 03:55:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:24.309 --> 03:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:29.950 --> 03:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:35.910 --> 03:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
is I open the exec session on House Bill
 
03:55:41.070 --> 03:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
285 uh this is uh one little line item
 
03:55:44.309 --> 03:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
focusing on Mental Health as a con
 
03:55:47.630 --> 03:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
consideration for parenting and the
 
03:55:52.870 --> 03:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:56.550 --> 03:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
it my illustrious predecessor
 
03:56:01.469 --> 03:56:01.479 align:start position:0%
moves what itl itl that is rice and D
 
03:56:04.870 --> 03:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
Simon and would you please speak to this
 
03:56:08.269 --> 03:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
certainly HB 285 unfairly singles out
 
03:56:10.229 --> 03:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
mental health conditions as a factor in
 
03:56:12.670 --> 03:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
custody decisions without requiring any
 
03:56:14.950 --> 03:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
evidence that the condition negative
 
03:56:16.750 --> 03:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
impacts a parents's ability to care for
 
03:56:19.070 --> 03:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
their child this Broad and vague
 
03:56:20.830 --> 03:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
language could lead to discrimination
 
03:56:22.870 --> 03:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
against parents who manage treatable
 
03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
conditions discouraging indivi
 
03:56:26.830 --> 03:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
individuals from seeking necessary
 
03:56:28.830 --> 03:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Care out of fear that the
 
03:56:31.790 --> 03:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
diagnosis could be used against them and
 
03:56:33.950 --> 03:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
custody determination should be based on
 
03:56:35.950 --> 03:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
specific behaviors and the actual
 
03:56:37.830 --> 03:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
well-being of the child not on
 
03:56:41.830 --> 03:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
generalized assumptions about mental
 
03:56:50.750 --> 03:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:58.910 --> 03:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:02.030 --> 03:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
chairman first I thought this at first I
 
03:57:03.830 --> 03:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
thought this would be a good
 
03:57:07.950 --> 03:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
reminder but then I realized after some
 
03:57:10.349 --> 03:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
conversation with some judges you know
 
03:57:12.429 --> 03:57:12.439 align:start position:0%
they really do take this into account
 
03:57:14.590 --> 03:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
and by separating it out as a special
 
03:57:17.030 --> 03:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
line item it might point a finger a
 
03:57:20.189 --> 03:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
little more pointedly than to other
 
03:57:22.389 --> 03:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
folks so I had an amendment prepared to
 
03:57:25.830 --> 03:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
soften it um and then came to the
 
03:57:28.670 --> 03:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
conclusion was persuaded by my caucus uh
 
03:57:32.110 --> 03:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
members that uh it's really not needed
 
03:57:36.349 --> 03:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
at best and at worst it could be um
 
03:57:38.710 --> 03:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
discriminatory so I just wanted to say I
 
03:57:40.510 --> 03:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
agree with that representative
 
03:57:43.550 --> 03:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
Raymond oh thank you Mr chairman um I
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
agree with you also you want to follow
 
03:57:48.149 --> 03:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
up no can I have um the sheet for The
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
Minority Report for the previous bill
 
03:57:51.550 --> 03:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
please sure of
 
03:57:53.670 --> 03:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
course I should have asked earlier but I
 
03:57:54.830 --> 03:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
forgot till just
 
03:57:56.990 --> 03:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
now thank you so much anybody else
 
03:57:59.510 --> 03:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you I know that the
 
03:58:03.990 --> 03:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh Prime sponsor is in the room I do
 
03:58:07.070 --> 03:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
want to honor the struggle and why this
 
03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
bill comes about and I do think that we
 
03:58:11.309 --> 03:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
have other legislation in including
 
03:58:13.830 --> 03:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
definitions that will really without
 
03:58:15.550 --> 03:58:15.560 align:start position:0%
calling calling it out directly will
 
03:58:18.510 --> 03:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
actually help in cases like this so I do
 
03:58:21.189 --> 03:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
think that we have other legislation um
 
03:58:23.070 --> 03:58:23.080 align:start position:0%
that is more broad that can cover more
 
03:58:24.950 --> 03:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
things at once that will actually help
 
03:58:28.349 --> 03:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
what this situation was trying to help
 
03:58:31.790 --> 03:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
with representative eimon thank you Mr
 
03:58:34.389 --> 03:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
chairman uh to Echo some of
 
03:58:37.630 --> 03:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
Representative Greg's uh sentiments um
 
03:58:41.990 --> 03:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
we have both been um working on a study
 
03:58:46.349 --> 03:58:46.359 align:start position:0%
committee to study definitions of uh
 
03:58:49.469 --> 03:58:49.479 align:start position:0%
certain issues that face
 
03:58:52.510 --> 03:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
families so I think that rather than
 
03:58:54.429 --> 03:58:54.439 align:start position:0%
single out one
 
03:58:57.510 --> 03:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
particular issue I would really rather
 
03:58:57.520 --> 03:58:58.990 align:start position:0%
particular issue I would really rather
work

03:58:58.990 --> 03:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:59:03.790 --> 03:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
on issues that can Encompass all
 
03:59:07.070 --> 03:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
parenting issues uh just because you
 
03:59:09.469 --> 03:59:09.479 align:start position:0%
have a mental health issue doesn't make
 
03:59:13.229 --> 03:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
you a person who should not have
 
03:59:15.349 --> 03:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
parenting rights
 
03:59:18.349 --> 03:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
I know of a few people who have serious
 
03:59:21.349 --> 03:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
mental issues and they are absolutely
 
03:59:25.389 --> 03:59:25.399 align:start position:0%
thoroughly phenomenal parents
 
03:59:27.950 --> 03:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
however if they were
 
03:59:30.950 --> 03:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
not the court would
 
03:59:33.830 --> 03:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
intervene and handle the situation to
 
03:59:37.830 --> 03:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
keep the kids in a safe environment so
 
03:59:40.830 --> 03:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
that's why I seconded the
 
03:59:45.070 --> 03:59:45.080 align:start position:0%
motion further discussion
 
03:59:47.950 --> 03:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none the motion before us is itl

representative rice do that
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
yeah because you had your hand up uh
 
04:02:19.870 --> 04:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
now discussion because there will be an
 
04:02:19.880 --> 04:02:21.229 align:start position:0%
now discussion because there will be an
amendment

04:02:21.229 --> 04:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:02:23.790 --> 04:02:23.800 align:start position:0%
coming uh from representative Raymond so
 
04:02:25.269 --> 04:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
why don't we hear from representative
 
04:02:27.870 --> 04:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman welcome um
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
so my uh amendment is very minor um
 
04:02:33.760 --> 04:02:35.750 align:start position:0%
so my uh amendment is very minor um
on

04:02:35.750 --> 04:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:02:38.510 --> 04:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh page well it's only one page on line
 
04:02:41.269 --> 04:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
19 C of the original it says when a
 
04:02:42.870 --> 04:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider has determined by
 
04:02:45.070 --> 04:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
clear en cment ing evidence based on
 
04:02:48.990 --> 04:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
articulable facts Etc um my Amendment
 
04:02:50.910 --> 04:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
simply strikes clear and convincing
 
04:02:53.510 --> 04:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
leaves evidence um and the rest of the
 
04:02:55.269 --> 04:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
sentence because clear and convincing is
 
04:02:57.269 --> 04:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
not a part of the child protective
 
04:03:01.830 --> 04:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
statute so we should be aligning our uh
 
04:03:04.950 --> 04:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
calling DCF in or you know taking
 
04:03:06.510 --> 04:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
actions when we're concerned about abuse
 
04:03:09.030 --> 04:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
or neglect with the child protection
 
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
statute and this is the language that
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
kept the bill from passing the last
 
04:03:14.510 --> 04:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
couple times it's been up
 
04:03:16.269 --> 04:03:16.279 align:start position:0%
CH would like to call on representative
 
04:03:19.149 --> 04:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
Markel because clear and convincing and
 
04:03:21.950 --> 04:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
preponderance and oh boy do we have the
 
04:03:23.710 --> 04:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
goods on you and all of those are legal
 
04:03:26.550 --> 04:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
terms and so uh we'd like to know a
 
04:03:28.870 --> 04:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
little bit about how line 19 of the
 
04:03:31.469 --> 04:03:31.479 align:start position:0%
original Bill compares to what's being
 
04:03:33.670 --> 04:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
suggested here okay well if you're
 
04:03:35.389 --> 04:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
dealing with the three standards of
 
04:03:38.110 --> 04:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
proof the top one is a criminal standard
 
04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
that's beyond A Reasonable Doubt uh that
 
04:03:43.950 --> 04:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
is a very high hurdle to get over clear
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
and convincing evidence is used very
 
04:03:50.550 --> 04:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
rarely in um used very rarely in civil
 
04:03:52.870 --> 04:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
matters you find it sometimes in
 
04:03:55.830 --> 04:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
contempt because of the possibility of
 
04:03:59.790 --> 04:03:59.800 align:start position:0%
incarceration uh well it's true and uh
 
04:04:01.910 --> 04:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes for example in other things
 
04:04:05.189 --> 04:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
like professional discipline uh for
 
04:04:07.750 --> 04:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
example um in my in the case of an
 
04:04:10.429 --> 04:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
attorney who's called based on his
 
04:04:13.389 --> 04:04:13.399 align:start position:0%
conduct uh the the professional conduct
 
04:04:16.030 --> 04:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
committee has to has before it brings a
 
04:04:18.790 --> 04:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
a docket a case for example has to
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
believe that there's a reasonable
 
04:04:22.750 --> 04:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
possibility that misconduct can be shown
 
04:04:24.590 --> 04:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
by clear and convincing evidence
 
04:04:26.469 --> 04:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's a very rarely used
 
04:04:28.870 --> 04:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
standard preponderance of the evidence
 
04:04:32.269 --> 04:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
which is basically 51% more likely than
 
04:04:34.990 --> 04:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
not just get the ball over the net is
 
04:04:37.910 --> 04:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
the more widely accepted standard so
 
04:04:39.229 --> 04:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
that might be something you might want
 
04:04:44.229 --> 04:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
to consider so as a lawyer um who has
 
04:04:47.070 --> 04:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
dealt with these matters a lot would you
 
04:04:50.070 --> 04:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh think that line 19 of the bill has
 
04:04:52.269 --> 04:04:52.279 align:start position:0%
determined by clear and convincing
 
04:04:57.309 --> 04:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
evidence uh should be amended as the uh
 
04:05:00.189 --> 04:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond suggested sir um
 
04:05:02.110 --> 04:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
let me just take a look right here okay
 
04:05:05.469 --> 04:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
that's 493 okay yeah I think it would be
 
04:05:07.590 --> 04:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
um you think the amendment would be I
 
04:05:09.950 --> 04:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
would think you would probably need to
 
04:05:14.710 --> 04:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
align that and uh align that uh um with
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:22.189 --> 04:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so under the child protectant
 
04:05:26.550 --> 04:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
statute which is RSA 169c it says um
 
04:05:28.990 --> 04:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
that if a if a mandated reporter has
 
04:05:30.990 --> 04:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable cause to suspect that's the
 
04:05:32.429 --> 04:05:32.439 align:start position:0%
standard of proof by which they would
 
04:05:34.670 --> 04:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
contact DC yeah I would yeah so in this
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
case it would say when a healthc care
 
04:05:38.950 --> 04:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
provider has determined by evidence and
 
04:05:40.670 --> 04:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
then I left the rest of it based upon
 
04:05:43.269 --> 04:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
articulable facts so there's still a St
 
04:05:45.830 --> 04:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's still the requirement that the
 
04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
that the provider has to have a reason
 
04:05:49.030 --> 04:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
for it it can't just be I have a funny
 
04:05:51.070 --> 04:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
feeling it has to be articulating that
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
the child has told me X or I'm saying
 
04:05:55.630 --> 04:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
that you know the child is covered in
 
04:05:58.389 --> 04:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
Bruises And if I do this it could result
 
04:06:00.550 --> 04:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
in further harm that would be it you
 
04:06:03.030 --> 04:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
know I would I'm not even sure that you
 
04:06:05.550 --> 04:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
really even need a standard of proof
 
04:06:07.870 --> 04:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
because that's a legal determination and
 
04:06:09.950 --> 04:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
what you're doing here is looking at
 
04:06:12.070 --> 04:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
reporting abuse if do I have that
 
04:06:13.870 --> 04:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
correct well okay so if you're looking
 
04:06:15.110 --> 04:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
at a porting
 
04:06:18.429 --> 04:06:18.439 align:start position:0%
review um you know that's basically a
 
04:06:20.830 --> 04:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
discretionary judgment and I don't know
 
04:06:24.269 --> 04:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
too many people outside I don't know too
 
04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
many people who are going to be able to
 
04:06:27.550 --> 04:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
articulate exactly what clear and
 
04:06:30.630 --> 04:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence is uh you know as a
 
04:06:32.910 --> 04:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
practical matter in the legal profession
 
04:06:35.149 --> 04:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
I'll call it
 
04:06:37.910 --> 04:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
75% okay
 
04:06:42.429 --> 04:06:42.439 align:start position:0%
uh preponderance of the evidence 51% get
 
04:06:45.630 --> 04:06:45.640 align:start position:0%
the ball over the more likely than not
 
04:06:47.550 --> 04:06:47.560 align:start position:0%
so I would just say if they've got
 
04:06:48.830 --> 04:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
reason to
 
04:06:51.189 --> 04:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
believe then that was what I would make
 
04:06:52.950 --> 04:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
it right which is what I would have made
 
04:06:54.670 --> 04:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
that but someone had already put in the
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill upon articulable fact and I thought
 
04:07:00.070 --> 04:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
well I would like to make the minimum
 
04:07:03.429 --> 04:07:03.439 align:start position:0%
changes okay necessary okay to satisfy
 
04:07:05.710 --> 04:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
well then articulable facts would make
 
04:07:07.870 --> 04:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
sense yep okay so in other words the
 
04:07:10.910 --> 04:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
answer is so you know Dr so and so or Mr
 
04:07:13.630 --> 04:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
so and so what did you what led you to
 
04:07:15.630 --> 04:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
believe that you should make this report
 
04:07:18.990 --> 04:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
well this this this this this this leads
 
04:07:19.990 --> 04:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
me to
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
conclude there you go y so in that case
 
04:07:25.950 --> 04:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
I would like to move otpa of my

now guess what the team comes together
 
04:11:12.189 --> 04:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
as we often do on I open the exact
 
04:11:16.429 --> 04:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
session on house Bill 493 and you should
 
04:11:22.030 --> 04:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:22.040 --> 04:11:23.870 align:start position:0%
 
0715

04:11:23.870 --> 04:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
0715
 
04:11:28.710 --> 04:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:32.269 --> 04:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
amendment Oh I thought so and hey guess
 
04:11:34.149 --> 04:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
what the Cher seconds it now
 
04:11:35.790 --> 04:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
representative Greg would you please
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
speak to the amendment
 
04:11:41.830 --> 04:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
0715 on House Bill 493 yes after um
 
04:11:44.070 --> 04:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
listening to testimony earlier we
 
04:11:46.950 --> 04:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
decided that to add the entire section
 
04:11:50.109 --> 04:11:50.119 align:start position:0%
two here so this is um taking out the
 
04:11:52.950 --> 04:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
part that was just uh taking care of
 
04:11:54.950 --> 04:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
kids or you know minors or whatever else
 
04:11:56.429 --> 04:11:56.439 align:start position:0%
so that way we could include this and
 
04:11:58.630 --> 04:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that um this is just part of
 
04:12:00.710 --> 04:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
the accredited the continuing education
 
04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
because we do understand how important
 
04:12:05.469 --> 04:12:05.479 align:start position:0%
it is to get this child abuse education
 
04:12:05.479 --> 04:12:06.429 align:start position:0%
it is to get this child abuse education
out

04:12:06.429 --> 04:12:06.439 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:12:10.950 --> 04:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
there and you have also Chang in line
 
04:12:14.309 --> 04:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
five to put this all under continuing
 
04:12:16.830 --> 04:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
medical education yes that came up too I
 
04:12:18.510 --> 04:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
forgot about that part too yes we
 
04:12:20.349 --> 04:12:20.359 align:start position:0%
changed the statute
 
04:12:22.870 --> 04:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
mhm but I do think that is it is
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
important to because we this language
 
04:12:27.750 --> 04:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
has been out there even though you know
 
04:12:29.149 --> 04:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
I understand with the medical
 
04:12:31.070 --> 04:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
association you know they would like to
 
04:12:33.630 --> 04:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
handle this unfortunately we've not seen
 
04:12:36.670 --> 04:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
them moving to do that at a at a greater
 
04:12:38.070 --> 04:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
at a great number that I would like to
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
see so I think based on the successful
 
04:12:43.870 --> 04:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
implementation of legislation on this in
 
04:12:46.550 --> 04:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
other states I would um I think that
 
04:12:48.870 --> 04:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
this is the right step for New Hampshire
 
04:12:52.389 --> 04:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
and to my point about how this could
 
04:12:54.670 --> 04:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
open the flood dat gates to all kinds of
 
04:12:56.870 --> 04:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
people wanting an hour for this and an
 
04:13:00.109 --> 04:13:00.119 align:start position:0%
hour for that I am
 
04:13:03.630 --> 04:13:03.640 align:start position:0%
persuaded that child abuse being such a
 
04:13:05.710 --> 04:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
very important topic and such a
 
04:13:08.990 --> 04:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
widespread thing would not necessarily
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
open the floodgates that we could say to
 
04:13:13.790 --> 04:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
people coming with other things that
 
04:13:16.429 --> 04:13:16.439 align:start position:0%
happens once in a million times I'm
 
04:13:18.510 --> 04:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
sorry this does not rise to the level of
 
04:13:22.189 --> 04:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
that so I am in effect withdrawing my um
 
04:13:25.229 --> 04:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
objection here and U saying how much I
 
04:13:28.109 --> 04:13:28.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate how the team as we often do
 
04:13:31.590 --> 04:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
came together anybody else oh
 
04:13:33.910 --> 04:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
04:13:35.910 --> 04:13:35.920 align:start position:0%

very much it means a lot to me um last
 
04:13:44.550 --> 04:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
year uh when this bill was heard I I'm
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
going to get choked up I can't I really
 
04:13:48.990 --> 04:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
can't barely talk about this there W um
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
there was a doctor who um thank you who
 
04:13:57.790 --> 04:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
uh testified about non-ambulatory
 
04:14:00.670 --> 04:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
infants who had been seen with bruising
 
04:14:04.830 --> 04:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
and then came back either dead or will
 
04:14:06.510 --> 04:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
live in a vegetative state for the rest
 
04:14:10.429 --> 04:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
of their lives and um I just could not
 
04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
shake that um and so I'm really glad
 
04:14:15.750 --> 04:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
that we were able to come to compromise
 
04:14:17.950 --> 04:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
on this and again thank you Mr chairman
 
04:14:20.750 --> 04:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
for your willingness to be open
 
04:14:22.590 --> 04:14:22.600 align:start position:0%

04:14:35.630 --> 04:14:35.640 align:start position:0%

04:14:38.590 --> 04:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
to all Physicians regardless of what age
 
04:14:38.600 --> 04:14:39.429 align:start position:0%
to all Physicians regardless of what age
thank

04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%

04:14:43.990 --> 04:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
you old Physicians young Physicians yeah
 
04:14:46.830 --> 04:14:46.840 align:start position:0%

04:14:50.149 --> 04:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
now representative D Simon thank you Mr
 
04:14:52.349 --> 04:14:52.359 align:start position:0%
chairman I think that what concerned me
 
04:14:55.189 --> 04:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
was when one of the Physicians testified
 
04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
today and in the beginning of his
 
04:15:00.510 --> 04:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
testimony stated that there are many
 
04:15:03.149 --> 04:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
Physicians who notice things but they're
 
04:15:04.950 --> 04:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
so rushed they don't want to stop and
 
04:15:07.389 --> 04:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
take the time well maybe if they had
 
04:15:07.399 --> 04:15:08.269 align:start position:0%
take the time well maybe if they had
this

04:15:08.269 --> 04:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:15:11.269 --> 04:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
education they would understand that is
 
04:15:14.429 --> 04:15:14.439 align:start position:0%
integral to the life of a child that
 
04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
they stop and take the time even though
 
04:15:21.149 --> 04:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
they are already mandated reporters they
 
04:15:22.830 --> 04:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
need to
 
04:15:27.389 --> 04:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
learn how to stop and take the time I
 
04:15:29.109 --> 04:15:29.119 align:start position:0%
get that they're rushed I get that
 
04:15:32.990 --> 04:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
they're busy I bless them all so that's
 
04:15:35.510 --> 04:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
why I'm I'm happy to vote for this I had
 
04:15:38.750 --> 04:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
a rather naughty thought here um at the
 
04:15:41.550 --> 04:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
medical center I supervise if the
 
04:15:43.550 --> 04:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
patient needs 26 minutes and the
 
04:15:46.830 --> 04:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
insurance reimburses for 15 the patient
 
04:15:50.109 --> 04:15:50.119 align:start position:0%
gets 26 minutes and for those doctors
 
04:15:52.670 --> 04:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I know many of them who are told you
 
04:15:54.910 --> 04:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
will spend 15 minutes then go to the
 
04:15:59.550 --> 04:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
next room I can see a um a rebuttal here
 
04:16:02.670 --> 04:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
to being rushed along when they see
 
04:16:05.309 --> 04:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
clear and present danger signs here that
 
04:16:08.070 --> 04:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
said yes I spent 18 minutes do you wish
 
04:16:11.429 --> 04:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
to discipline me bring it on so you know
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
I am very fed up with the state of
 
04:16:15.870 --> 04:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
medical as the insurance companies have
 
04:16:18.469 --> 04:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
hijacked it so um I I don't think I need
 
04:16:20.750 --> 04:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
to make that as in a form of emotion I
 
04:16:23.710 --> 04:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
think that's acclamation anyone else yes
 
04:16:26.389 --> 04:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative coren thank you Mr
 
04:16:29.109 --> 04:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
chairman um that's not what I got from
 
04:16:32.550 --> 04:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
the story I got that the physician wrote
 
04:16:35.309 --> 04:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
it down knowing he was seeing abuse but
 
04:16:37.950 --> 04:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
didn't want to get involved and to me
 
04:16:40.429 --> 04:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
that's a whole another can of wors needs
 
04:16:42.990 --> 04:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
to be dealt with
 
04:16:44.510 --> 04:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
that is different I think it's also a
 
04:16:47.030 --> 04:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
valid point yeah anyone else
 
04:16:48.990 --> 04:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
representative Rong thank you Mr
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
chairman the other thing that becomes
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
clear with this amendment is that
 
04:16:56.469 --> 04:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
because it applies to all Physicians not
 
04:16:58.750 --> 04:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
those who just treat um patients under
 
04:17:02.189 --> 04:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 is that it may help
 
04:17:05.070 --> 04:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
Physicians who may not be seeing that
 
04:17:08.070 --> 04:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
the victim of child abuse to be able to
 
04:17:10.389 --> 04:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
recognize that it may exist because of
 
04:17:13.309 --> 04:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
how they may be treating a parent or a
 
04:17:16.429 --> 04:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
sibling or a caregiver so I think having
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
all Physicians more aware of the
 
04:17:21.550 --> 04:17:21.560 align:start position:0%
reporting and signs of child abuse it
 
04:17:23.830 --> 04:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
may help children who that particular
 
04:17:25.630 --> 04:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
physician may not be seeing or that
 
04:17:28.469 --> 04:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
nurse prti nurse practitioner physician
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
an excellent point I've just asked the
 
04:17:31.229 --> 04:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
clerk to make sure that's been put in
 
04:17:33.309 --> 04:17:33.319 align:start position:0%

04:17:33.319 --> 04:17:36.349 align:start position:0%
the minutes that's a very good point

else okay the motion before us I believe
 
04:17:40.429 --> 04:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
is the
 
04:17:43.149 --> 04:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
