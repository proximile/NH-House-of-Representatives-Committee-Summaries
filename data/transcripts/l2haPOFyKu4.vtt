00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.629 align:start position:0%
thank you so much mr chairman can i be
heard

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
you can oh wonderful wonderful thank you
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
my name is jill
 
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
bissonnette i'm the legal director for
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
the aclu of new hampshire we support
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh senate bill 41 as things are
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
right now police decertification
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
hearings are
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
usually held in secret the public is
 
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.230 align:start position:0%
usually held in secret the public is
kept

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
kept
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
in the dark about what happens in these
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
hearings and there's
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
no public review of the process really
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
unless the officer
 
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
potentially being decertified chooses to
 
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.629 align:start position:0%
potentially being decertified chooses to
grant

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
the public access and so this bill would
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
remedy this and create a process that's
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
more in line
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
with how disciplinary hearings are
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
conducted for judges and lawyers
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
which are public i'd also note that our
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
former attorney general gordon mcdonald
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
has also publicly declared his support
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
for this type of legislation stating
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
quote i would support a legislative
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
change which aligns the police standards
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
and training council certification
 
00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:27.430 align:start position:0%
and training council certification
hearings

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
with the statutes that allow other
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
professional licensure boards to conduct
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
public hearings it's the right thing to
 
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.430 align:start position:0%
public hearings it's the right thing to
do

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
and that's end quote um lastly
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
i would note that the house already
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
heard its own version of this bill
 
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
and that was house bill 471 which was
 
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
sponsored by
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
representative roy and was heard before
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
the house criminal justice and public
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
safety committee
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
that bill came out of committee 20 to
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
nothing and passed
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh the house by voice vote on april 7th
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
just a few
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
weeks ago the senate judiciary committee
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
took this bill up
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
um just last week on april 15th
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
and uh also amended it um or potent or
 
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.870 align:start position:0%
and uh also amended it um or potent or
not

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
is considering i should say an amendment
 
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:13.910 align:start position:0%
is considering i should say an amendment
uh

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh to add to this bill that would also
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
address the public disclosure of the
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence schedule so i just
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to let the committee know
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
of that and in light of that i think my
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation actually would be
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
for this committee to actually just
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
retain senate bill
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
41 this bill and allow hb 471 to be the
 
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.949 align:start position:0%
41 this bill and allow hb 471 to be the
vehicle

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
to address this issue especially where i
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
think actually the language
 
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
um in hb 471 is frankly just a little
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
bit cleaner than the language here
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
in sb41 so that's just my thinking
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
i wanted to let the committee know and
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
of course i'd be happy to take any
 
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.150 align:start position:0%
of course i'd be happy to take any
questions

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for uh attorney
 
00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:01.190 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for uh attorney
bison

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
i guess i i did have a question
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe you somewhat addressed that in
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
your testimony and
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
that is with regard to the language of
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
one of the things that would have to be
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
shown in order to close the hearing is
 
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.550 align:start position:0%
shown in order to close the hearing is
that

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
the information is confidential but
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
is is confidential information defined
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
someplace in the statute
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
i guess what constitutes confidential
 
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.509 align:start position:0%
i guess what constitutes confidential
information

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's a great question it is actually
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
not defined in this statute but i think
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
the reason why
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
that language has been used is because
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's modeled
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
after the standards that exist
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
in the courts for when confidential
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
information is sealed and so for example
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire superior court rule of
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
criminal procedure
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
50 or 51 i believe actually has a list
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
of information that's uh presumptively
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
confidential that would allow
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
courts to have that information sealed
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
and overcome the public's
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
right of access and so that's um
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
that it's not defined in this particular
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
statute but it's essentially modeled
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
after this that's i think the intent um
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
as to what confidential information
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
would mean this is really again just
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
modeling the standard here is modeled
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
after how the courts
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
and i guess if i could ask another
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
question that was
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
it uses the language creates a
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
compelling interest
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
i guess the question is how do you
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
measure what a compelling interest is
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
what is compelling interest
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so again that's actually the same
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
standard that exists in the court system
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
and it comes right out of the
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh the key the petition re-keen sentinel
 
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.030 align:start position:0%
uh the key the petition re-keen sentinel
case

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh from a few decades ago and i'd be
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
happy uh chairman to actually circulate
 
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:09.990 align:start position:0%
happy uh chairman to actually circulate
that

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
um and i think you know what that
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
standard is really getting at are
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
situations where there's you know a very
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
important privacy interest at play like
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
information concerning confidential
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
informants that comes up sometimes in
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
criminal cases
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
and there's a really overwhelming public
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
interest sometimes to not have that
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
information be public even if it's part
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
of a court pleading
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
so i think the idea here is that in
 
00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
police standards and training
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
decertification hearings there could be
 
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.430 align:start position:0%
decertification hearings there could be
situations

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
and it's hard to anticipate when and how
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
they would come up but there could be
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
situations in which there would just be
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
really sensitive
 
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
information in play and so what this
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
does is just create a mechanism for
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
in those rare circumstances to to have
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
that information be sealed but it really
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
should be a rare event just like it's a
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
rare event in court proceedings
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
for information to be sealed
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
and i had one other question and that
 
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.829 align:start position:0%
and i had one other question and that
was

00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
at some point in time someone has to
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
make a decision as to whether or not
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
the hearing or a portion of the hearing
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
should be closed
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mention in here specifically
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
who that is
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
should there be some reference to who
 
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:24.790 align:start position:0%
should there be some reference to who
that

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
is for hearing prophecy or whatever
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman and in fact that
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
actually is one reason why the language
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
in hb
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
471 might be a little better and cleaner
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
than the language here in senate bill
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
41. so
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
in hb 471 the house criminal justice
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
committee actually amended the bill to
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
tack on a sentence
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
that said the council may in a
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
non-public session
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
hear and consider the request for
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
closure in rule on such
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
such a request that language is not
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
actually in senate bill 41
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
and i think the purpose of that language
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman is to get at the concern you
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
just raised
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
is that mechanically i think the way it
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
should work is that it's the pstc
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
council that's doing that pass in
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
deciding whether something is
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
confidential or not
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
someone shouldn't have to like you know
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
file up 91a action or anything like that
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
so that is really again designed to
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
model this after the court process
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
where it's the trial judge or the
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
district judge that makes the decision
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
whether information should be sealed and
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
of course that decision
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
should be private should happen you know
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
privately as well right
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
um in order to protect the interests of
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
those involved and so that's again
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's the idea behind the language of
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
471 and another reason why we think
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
you know it might be just you know
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative burch thank you mr
 
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.629 align:start position:0%
yes representative burch thank you mr
chair

00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
and thank you attorney bisonette for
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question my concern
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
is the difference between uh
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
the language that says any person who
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
has an interest
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
may be uh represented or part of the
 
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.509 align:start position:0%
may be uh represented or part of the
proceeding

00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
but that the only person but only a
 
00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:15.350 align:start position:0%
but that the only person but only a
party

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
can ask that the matter be closed
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
so let's say um
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
i i'm a witness and i'm part of the
 
00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:26.790 align:start position:0%
i i'm a witness and i'm part of the
proceeding

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
and there's a grounds where i think uh
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
my stuff should be uh kept
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
private let's say i'm a minor or
 
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.870 align:start position:0%
private let's say i'm a minor or
whatever

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
am i reading it correct that only a
 
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.069 align:start position:0%
am i reading it correct that only a
party

00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
can uh can ask for closure
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
you're uh you're referring to the
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
language of senate bill 41 itself not
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
471 correct
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
yeah we're just looking at 41 here yeah
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
i i think that's a good question and i
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
i at least the way i read it i kind of
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
had viewed it as it's a party to the
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
pstc hearing process which would be
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
you know either the um the psdc
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
officer that is essentially prosecuting
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
the action or the officer itself
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if i borrow it uh if i
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
if i construe it to bar third parties
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
from also
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
um having their interests heard but it's
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
a good question i don't have a great
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
answer for you i could just tell you
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
that i think in
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
the court process right the only folks
 
00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:31.670 align:start position:0%
the court process right the only folks
that

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
really go through the motion to seal
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
process or the actual parties or
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
litigants at least in my experience so
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
again i think this language really here
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
is just designed
 
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
to try to model this as much as possible
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
today thank you
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
and i don't have anyone else who has
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
are there any other persons who are in
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
attendance who would like to testify
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
xenon will close the hearing on senate
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
and we have a few minutes before we
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
begin our hearing
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
on 143
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
i note uh that on 143 we have 10 people
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
who have signed up
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
to speak there are only 14 people who
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
signed up and support
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
two in opposition and 10 people who
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
signed up
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
to speak this morning
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
you if you saw my email yesterday my
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
intent is to call upon
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
senator carson first who is the sponsor
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
of the omnibus bill
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
in its entirety but she's also the
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor i think on six of the
 
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.190 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor i think on six of the
twelve

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
twelve
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
bills six of the twelve parts that
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
constitute the omnibus bill
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
and then call upon the other senators
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
and then if there are any reps who would
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
like to speak i'll call upon them and
 
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.590 align:start position:0%
like to speak i'll call upon them and
then

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
just generally open it up i considered
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
going part by part
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
but the issue with that
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
is if somebody we scheduled a hearing
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
for 9 30 if
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
somebody is on the 12th car i was
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
concerned that they might have to wait
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
two hours
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
before they get to speak and i'm not
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
sure that that was particularly fair
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
so we're just going to open it up to
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to speak and not go
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr chairman yes
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
i missed how many speakers you said
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
there were you mentioned it and i just
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
missed the number
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
there are 10 people who have registered
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
in advance to speak
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
i did uh set out a schedule uh
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
with regard to the bills we we have six
 
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.110 align:start position:0%
with regard to the bills we we have six
bills

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh if you actually broke them into parts
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
we have about 30 bills but
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
the because they we have three
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
fairly large omnibus bills
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
they so and
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
what is planned is we meet every tuesday
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
for this week and the next four weeks
 
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
to hear the bills and to execute
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
and to get them out and which would give
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
us plenty of time
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
before we're required to get them out
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
there and none of the bills have to go
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
so we don't need to be concerned about
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
that with
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
rushing through any of the bills in
 
00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.350 align:start position:0%
rushing through any of the bills in
particular

00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
and we have uh
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
two two of the hearings are just gonna
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
be on omnibus bills one omnibus bill
 
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.070 align:start position:0%
be on omnibus bills one omnibus bill
each

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh because they are very large and
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
complicated this bill
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
that we're about to hear was probably
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
the least complicated of the omnibus
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
bills i thought
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
and that's why i scheduled it
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
with with the other bill today
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
and we generate the least amount of
 
00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:37.190 align:start position:0%
and we generate the least amount of
controversy

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
i note that the very first part of this
 
00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:40.950 align:start position:0%
i note that the very first part of this
bill

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
will be familiar to everyone as it
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
addresses the issue of appointment for
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:19.669 align:start position:0%
 
minors

00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
and from what i'm told it looks like we
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
will be back for
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
the session the week before last i
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
thought people represented themselves
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
and the committee
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
well we had some really tough issues to
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
it was it was very interesting i thought
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
the uh the debate
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
particularly the debate of 111 was uh
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
interesting debating that was one of the
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
few debates where we had
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
people from both parties waiting on
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
was maybe not the outcome that
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
some wanted but very
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
thoughtful interesting debate i thought
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
they thought the people in our committee
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
represented the committee
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%

00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
through civil cases
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't quite catch the
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
would would the attorney follow this
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
child if the if a civil case was brought
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
against the child
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
for something similar to the case that
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
they were the criminal case that was
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
against them
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to defer that question um
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh sarah blodgett from the uh
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
judicial council is going to
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
be testifying and she'll be able to
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
great and then i just have one more mr
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
chairman sarah
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
sorry that's why we're here go ahead um
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
on part five with the
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
cheap the justices sitting in for the
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
how would that affect um someone filed
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
an appeal
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
how would would that have
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
it seems like it would be a touchy
 
00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.109 align:start position:0%
it seems like it would be a touchy
situation

00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%

new durham rochester and farmington i am
the

00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of part two of the
 
00:44:00.319 --> 00:44:02.390 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of part two of the
bill

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
there's two concepts i want you to
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
remember when you're looking at
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
part two and that is uh
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
failure failure to report collateral
 
00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.390 align:start position:0%
failure failure to report collateral
assets

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
assets
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
and the uh ability
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
for uh the state to recoup the funds
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
from future grants right now the
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
law as it is enacted only allows them to
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
recruit those assets from future grants
 
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
and that is especially important if the
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh person has failed to report
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
collateral assets
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
something they own um so
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
the state you know in taking care of our
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
blind our aged
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
our disabled and our dependent children
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
need to be a good steward of those funds
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
and right now the statute
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
hampers us in doing that in those two
 
00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.309 align:start position:0%
hampers us in doing that in those two
areas

00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
so um the department has asked me to
 
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
submit this bill
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that the very talented uh
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
franchesca hennessey
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
will be here to testify and give you
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
more detail on that
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
but those are the two concepts that i
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
want you to take away from this
 
00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:25.839 align:start position:0%
is is recovering funds for people who
 
00:45:25.839 --> 00:45:27.750 align:start position:0%
is is recovering funds for people who
have

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
misstated or failed to report
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
assets that they have and
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
our ability to collect the money or
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
recoup the money in other ways other
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
than just with
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
lower future grants if you have any
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
questions of me i'd be
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
happy to try and answer them are there
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
and i don't see any other
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
senators or representatives who have
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
so going down the list there's
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
hey sir can you hear me weekend
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%

i'm major general david mikulitis uh the
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%

national guard
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh i'm here to talk on behalf of section
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
12 that senator carson was kind enough
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
to submit legislation for us um
 
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
we provide a tuition waiver at any state
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%

joins the national
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
our guard hampshire scholarship fund is
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
somewhat antiquated in a sense that
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
um it's just not a significant benefit
 
00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:02.870 align:start position:0%
um it's just not a significant benefit
it

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
that it used to be based upon the
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
tuition waiver that we get at any state
 
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.390 align:start position:0%
tuition waiver that we get at any state
university

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
university
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
however the number one biggest strategic
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
challenge to an
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
all-volunteer force is the ability for
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
us to fill our formations
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
um there's no line at our door we're
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
constantly trying to recruit the next
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
greatest generation into our formations
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
and it has been a struggle since only 29
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
of today's youth is eligible for
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
military service
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
um whether it's childhood obesity
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
prescription medication
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
lack of a high school degree you name it
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
the challenges
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
of an all-volunteer force are
 
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.589 align:start position:0%
of an all-volunteer force are
significant

00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
what this uh proposed legislation will
 
00:47:44.559 --> 00:47:44.950 align:start position:0%
what this uh proposed legislation will
do

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
is it will allow a current guardsman
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
who's enlisted like us
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
private a sergeant up to junior officers
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire national guard
 
00:47:54.839 --> 00:47:56.549 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire national guard
retirees

00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
retirees
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
to earn a 500 cash benefit
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
for recruiting additional soldiers and
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
airmen into our formations
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
i mean it's that simple um we struggle
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
to fill our formations every year we
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
need to recruit about 350 new soldiers
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
and airmen
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
and it has been a constant challenge the
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire army national guard
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
is the smallest national guard per
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
capita to its population
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
in the country and we have a concerted
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
effort to both fill our formations and
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
grow our formations
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why the reason why we ask
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
senator carson to propose this
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
legislation for us
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know subject to your questions
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative chase
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
um i'm so sorry i missed your rank
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh major general ma'am major general
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i wanted to
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
say that properly is is this my husband
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
was a recruiter for the national guard
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
for years and then the program
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
stopped probably maybe seven eight years
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
ago is this the same program as before
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
no that was a federal program that they
 
00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.950 align:start position:0%
no that was a federal program that they
discontinued

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
discontinued
 
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay it's similar in function
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
but it's different in the sense that um
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know this would be for state
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
general funds versus that it was a prior
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
program that was uh
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know for the federal government all
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
right thank you so much for clarifying
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
that for me
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
so as as i understand the program it's
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
as simple as you find somebody who
 
00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.390 align:start position:0%
as simple as you find somebody who
enlists

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
enlists
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
and if you do you're you're a current
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
member of the national guard
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
you get you get a 500 bonus basically
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's it that's it simple just uh we're
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
referral business
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
um that's how it usually works and so
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
you know if we can entice a
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know high school graduate who joins
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
the national guard
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
to say that he had a positive experience
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
and trying to get some of his friends to
 
00:50:02.079 --> 00:50:03.109 align:start position:0%
and trying to get some of his friends to
join

00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
join
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo thank you mr
 
00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.309 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo thank you mr
chair

00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you um general for taking my
 
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.309 align:start position:0%
and thank you um general for taking my
question

00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
and my question is around retention of
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
those recruits for whom the bonus is
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
um paid for is there like a requirement
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
as to how long the person has to be
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh no ma'am so you usually will happen
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
is a tournament enlistment for a
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
new soldier airman joining the national
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
guard is typically six
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
years what we would do is we would
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
probably wait for them to complete their
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
basic training and then what's called
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
their advanced individual training
 
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure they've been
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
properly assessed
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
into the guard and they can begin their
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
service obligation
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
so instead of just giving to a kid when
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
he just uh raises his hand
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know we would set up a policies and
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
procedures to allow that bonus not to
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
occur until that
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
individual is physically in our
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
formations after the completion of their
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
basic training
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
are there other questions for the
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
general yes
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you ms um
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
general micheladas for taking my
 
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.150 align:start position:0%
general micheladas for taking my
question

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
could you clarify for me i didn't
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
understand um in the beginning when you
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
were talking about the tuition
 
00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.470 align:start position:0%
were talking about the tuition
reimbursement

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
are you planning to continue that uh
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
within the university system or how is
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
that changing
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh ma'am uh no change to that i just
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to suggest to you that
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know the university system of new
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the community college
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
system of new hampshire have been
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
stellar supporters of the national guard
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
and that benefit or free tuition waiver
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
tony state university
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
is just more appealing than giving out a
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
small scholarship to someone
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why we want to take those
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
funds it was 25
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
000 and almost put this to an incentive
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
enlistment incentive program
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%

uniform standards to obtain a license
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
there is no mention of those standards
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
in our statutes this proposal will
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
remedy that condition
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
secondly it amends the department of
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
revenue administration statute
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
to allow them to share information with
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
about the business
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax credit so the bet
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
credits with the department of insurance
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
so the department can
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
verify the proper premium taxes being
 
00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.150 align:start position:0%
verify the proper premium taxes being
collected

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
collected
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
the insurance industry is supportive of
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
and i believe that there are folks here
 
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department to answer
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee may
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
have regarding
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh part 11. i thank you for your
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
consideration of this legislation
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
other questions for senator daniels yes
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um senator daniels
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
when i was reading through
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
um title 11 i saw a term called
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
foreign and foreign insurance companies
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
does that mean
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
overseas foreign companies or
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
out-of-state companies
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um if i may uh
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
i don't i believe that marty mobley
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
from the department of insurance may be
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
on i can't see the participants
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
um i think they would probably be better
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
in answering that question than i
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%

00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
i don't see marty mowgli as a
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
attendee although marty mo we did sign
 
00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.510 align:start position:0%
attendee although marty mo we did sign
in

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:25.190 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
hello good morning can you hear me
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
hi uh my name is heather silverstein i'm
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the new hampshire
 
00:55:47.599 --> 00:55:47.990 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the new hampshire
insurance

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
department uh yes marty's handling
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
another um
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
hearing today i'll be testifying on this
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
to the question posed about the foreign
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
um companies those are out of state
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
companies so that's how our that's how
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
that it's a little confusing if you're
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
not in the insurance industry but that's
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
just what that means out of state
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
companies that are not
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
the home state is not insurance and
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
domestic companies are
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
there their home state is here in new
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire so
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
um so part 11 i'll just briefly um
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh senator danner's did a great job of
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
going over
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
the scope of the part 11. basically
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to clean up
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
the licensing statute for domestic and
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
foreign companies to make sure it's
 
00:56:31.359 --> 00:56:32.069 align:start position:0%
foreign companies to make sure it's
clear

00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
we use any ic standards national
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
association of insurance commissioners
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure companies have proper
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
capital um that they're safe reliable
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's done nationwide it's not a surprise
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
to industry
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
so making this change is really a good
 
00:56:46.799 --> 00:56:47.990 align:start position:0%
so making this change is really a good
thing

00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
um as far as the licensing piece
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
is considered the other part of the bill
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
pertaining to revenue and wanting to
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
amend rsa21j14
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 5d um so what happens is
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
the our licensees like insurance
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
companies they can take
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
um they they paid a revenue a business
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
so if they do that they can get a credit
 
00:57:18.069 --> 00:57:18.079 align:start position:0%
from their premium taxes with our
 
00:57:18.079 --> 00:57:19.190 align:start position:0%
from their premium taxes with our
department

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
and currently the way it's set up is we
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
can't get the information from revenue
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
because of the way the statute is
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
to find out what they actually paid to
 
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.270 align:start position:0%
to find out what they actually paid to
revenue

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
so this exception that we're asking for
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
is just um a way to have revenue be able
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
to share that information with us
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
so that we can um char um so that we
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
know that we are charging the proper
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
premium tax that this
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
credit that was taken was the right
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
amount of the credit um how that works
 
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:49.510 align:start position:0%
amount of the credit um how that works
is

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
it gets reported in 2000 as far as the
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax gets reported
 
00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.109 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax gets reported
2019

00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
2019
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
paid to revenue in 2020 and then a
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
company could say to our department
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
um we would like credit uh in 2021
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
and we would give them credit but we
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
have no way of going back to revenue to
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
find out if
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
what we're giving for credit is actually
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
accurate this would also
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
require a memorandum of understanding
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
we share information with revenue our
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
statute does not permit it
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
but theirs does and we this um
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
exception is very narrow i actually
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
drafted this it's tailored to the
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
employment security
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh exception that's on the statute under
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
i believe number six so it's very
 
00:58:35.599 --> 00:58:36.630 align:start position:0%
i believe number six so it's very
similar

00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
um we're just we want the information
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
just to make sure everything is accurate
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
and everything remains confidential
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
i am happy to take questions if you have
 
00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:47.750 align:start position:0%
i am happy to take questions if you have
any

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh can you tell me
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
what kind of
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
entity uh naic is
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh so the nasa national association of
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioners
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
all of the states are in this
 
00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.990 align:start position:0%
all of the states are in this
association

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
and it's so that our it helps our
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
licensees because we
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
develop at you know nationwide we
 
00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.630 align:start position:0%
develop at you know nationwide we
develop

00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
develop
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
regulations and laws and then we
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
introduce them
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
into each of our states so that the
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
standards are more uniform
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
so you don't have companies having to uh
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
abide by all these different regulations
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
and all these different laws and
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
and the states and doesn't mean that we
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
don't have some variation because we do
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
but it's a way to collaborate and make
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
it easier on our licensees
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
uh so that there's similar standards
 
00:59:43.119 --> 00:59:44.789 align:start position:0%
uh so that there's similar standards
applied

00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
applied
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
if i can follow up you sure can um
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
so i don't think i exactly maybe asked
 
00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.349 align:start position:0%
so i don't think i exactly maybe asked
the

00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
question incorrectly but uh legally is
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
this a non-profit
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
is it a government entity is it a
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
private corporation
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i believe it's a non-profit um and
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's all states are involved
 
01:00:05.119 --> 01:00:06.309 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's all states are involved
uh

01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know we pay a membership to be part
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
of the association
 
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh we go to seminars at the neic um
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
takes we collaborate with other states
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
when we're developing
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
model laws and model rules which we may
 
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:19.829 align:start position:0%
model laws and model rules which we may
introduce

01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
into the states and
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of discussion with
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
industry with consumer groups
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
during that process so it's a very um
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort and it helps us
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
pool our resources as well
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
and again it doesn't mean that just
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
because a model law
 
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
was developed at the neic that we're
 
01:00:41.359 --> 01:00:42.390 align:start position:0%
was developed at the neic that we're
gonna

01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
introduce it just the way it was but
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of times we will take you know the
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
base of it at least
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
um if it's something that we think is
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
you know reliable makes sense for
 
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
industry makes sense for
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
consumers thank you thank you
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
if not thank you for your testimony
 
01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.430 align:start position:0%
if not thank you for your testimony
today

01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and committee
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
members i'm sarah blodgett with the new
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire judicial council
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking to part one of this
 
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:28.950 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking to part one of this
bill

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
the appointment of counsel for minor in
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
a juvenile delinquency proceeding
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
as i believe most of you are aware
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
the judicial council received a an
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
assessment by the national
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
juvenile defender center the end of this
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
past summer
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
regarding their assessment of the
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
quality of representation that is
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
provided to
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
juveniles in delinquency proceedings
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
and is part of the response to that
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
the judicial council took a position on
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 188 that was spent sponsored
 
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:06.549 align:start position:0%
house bill 188 that was spent sponsored
by

01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative burch that
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
went to address many of the issues that
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
were raised in the njdc
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
assessment the judicial council did not
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
take a formal position
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
on this bill but the language regarding
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
juvenile representation
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
is almost identical to the language that
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
was in representative burge's bill
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
and the judicial council although there
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
was not a quorum present
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
did vote in favor of that bill
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
and this language addresses several of
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
the concerns that were raised by the
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
national juvenile defender center
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns was the need for
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
earlier appointment of counsel
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
and this bill allows for that to take
 
01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.309 align:start position:0%
and this bill allows for that to take
place

01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
it also tightens up the scenarios in
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
which a juvenile is allowed to
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
waive their right to counsel one of the
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
issues i know representative
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
rice brought up was a concern that i
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
believe came up
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
with representative burch's bill that
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
some of the language here could be seen
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
as an extension of the right to counsel
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
for juveniles in
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
civil proceedings and i i think
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
that in in drafting this language the
 
01:03:26.319 --> 01:03:27.029 align:start position:0%
that in in drafting this language the
intent

01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
was to have an attorney
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
representing a juvenile in a delinquency
 
01:03:33.039 --> 01:03:34.549 align:start position:0%
representing a juvenile in a delinquency
proceeding

01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
work with that same juvenile to prevent
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
them from
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
speaking about the the charges the
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
allegations at issue
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh in the delinquency but i i
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
understand that concern and i believe
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
remainder of this bill is so crucial to
 
01:03:55.039 --> 01:03:55.910 align:start position:0%
remainder of this bill is so crucial to
addressing

01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
the national juvenile defender center
 
01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.230 align:start position:0%
the national juvenile defender center
recommendations

01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
that i would be happy to work with
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
anybody on an amendment
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
that may address the concerns about a
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
significant expansion of the right to
 
01:04:08.799 --> 01:04:11.270 align:start position:0%
significant expansion of the right to
counsel

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
i will also say that i think that um
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
recent changes recent charges rather
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
that came from the ydc investigation is
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
a reminder to all of us
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
about the vulnerability of children
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
involved in the juvenile justice system
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
and so i think it's important to address
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
the concerns about this bill
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
but also to have a lot of the changes
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill would
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
accomplish go through this session so
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
that we can really start to
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
work on addressing some of the areas
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
that need
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
improvement i'm happy to take questions
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.839 --> 01:04:56.230 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair uh thank you uh
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
sarah blodgett for your uh coaching
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and i wanted to also speak
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
just briefly as to the issue raised
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh by representative rice uh
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's a fair issue to raise and it's a
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
fair issue
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
the the group that worked on original
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
bill 188
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
um wrestled with what language to use
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh to avoid the idea
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
that appointed council could represent
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh juveniles and all sorts of civil
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
matters we did not want to go in that
 
01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
matters we did not want to go in that
direction

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
the actual language in this bill
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
which i'm reading from
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
says has a lot of guard rails to it
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
says representation shall include
 
01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.990 align:start position:0%
says representation shall include
representation

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
at related proceedings as one guardrail
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
when such matters are based on the same
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
factual circumstances
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
second guard rail as the petition
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
and involvement in the related
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
proceeding is necessary
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
to provide effective representation on
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
the petition
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
third guard rail so we've put in three
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
there in this bill three guard rails
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
to limit um that
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
that concern and also the representation
 
01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:23.990 align:start position:0%
that concern and also the representation
ends

01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
ends
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
when uh the court no longer has
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the child
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
so that that becomes a fourth guard rail
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
in any event i'm happy to work with
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
representative rice
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh and talk this issue over and see if
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
we can come up with language or uh agree
 
01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
that the language now with the four
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
guard rails is sufficient either way i'm
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
presuming that was a question
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
i one just
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
a question only because it comes from
 
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
our experience with
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
house bill 188 and it seemed that
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
there was a substantial criticism of
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
one particular part and that was with
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
juvenile statements or confessions and
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
how they might be
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
used is from your perspective
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
is that a critical part of the bill or
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
is representation of the juvenile
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question mr chairman
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
that was one of the recommendations in
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
the national
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
juvenile sen national juvenile defender
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
center assessment
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
but it is that is a big step forward
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
um for representation and i
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
i will say that that is
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire were to implement that
 
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
piece of this bill
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
we would be one of the few jurisdictions
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
in the nation that had taken that step
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
i know that there are other
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
provide for council at interrogation
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
um but it would be a
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
a significant step forward for new
 
01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.590 align:start position:0%
a significant step forward for new
hampshire

01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
and i think that in addition to
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
the change that that would would
 
01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.309 align:start position:0%
the change that that would would
implement

01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
implement
 
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
requirement for us to put into place a
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
system that would have the public
 
01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.709 align:start position:0%
system that would have the public
defender

01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
defender
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
available to respond at any time of the
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
day or night when a juvenile is being
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
questioned by
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and i certainly
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
understand the intent
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
of that requirement i think we have all
 
01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:08.789 align:start position:0%
of that requirement i think we have all
learned

01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
learned
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
quite a bit over the past few years
 
01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
about adolescent brain development
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
and what adolescents are really able to
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
understand and process
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
and so certainly um and with my history
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
former public defender i do see
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
the importance of this um
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
but i would say that some of the other
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
areas that this
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
bill covers really are fundamental needs
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm wondering if
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
it would be possible since we're talking
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
on part one
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
if we could hear from michelle wangren i
 
01:09:54.159 --> 01:09:54.709 align:start position:0%
if we could hear from michelle wangren i
know

01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
she was working um on hb 188
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
and i'd really like to hear what they
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
came up with before we
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
lose sight and end up in another part
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see if we could
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
kind of keep it on this part for a
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
minute would that be possible
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
if she's available i see her hand up so
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%

i
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
i did work extensively on hb 188 and
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
involved in some pretty extensive
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
discussions on sb
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
143 as well i will say that after
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are familiar with
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
what happened with
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
hb 188 it did pass through the committee
 
01:10:57.679 --> 01:10:59.030 align:start position:0%
hb 188 it did pass through the committee
unanimously

01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
unanimously
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
but um former justice and representative
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
lynn had some pretty significant
 
01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:04.070 align:start position:0%
lynn had some pretty significant
concerns

01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
about a number of portions of that bill
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh attorney skibby and i did have the
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
meet with justice lynn to talk about um
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
some of his concerns and try to work
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
through them
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
you know i think you know in terms of um
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
the bill there are a number of areas
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
where i think that
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
everyone recognizes their um they are
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
good practice
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
under the the new hampshire juvenile
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
defender center report
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
we know that new hampshire needs to have
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
earlier appointment of counsel
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
we know that children are entering court
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
for the first time
 
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
having never consulted with counsel let
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
alone having counsel available to them
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh we know that there is a problem with
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
how we structure
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
payment of contract attorney fees and
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
there's a significant disincentive
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
to for them to provide effective and
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
extensive juvenile representation
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
we know that we need a better
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
performance standards
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
for for juvenile defenders uh which has
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
been highlighted
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
as a recommendation from the national
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
juvenile defender center
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
i think the areas of disagreement that
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
we had with representative lynn i think
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
some of them
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
are resolvable and and one of them is
 
01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:25.510 align:start position:0%
are resolvable and and one of them is
not

01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
um the primary areas of disagreement
 
01:12:28.159 --> 01:12:28.709 align:start position:0%
um the primary areas of disagreement
were

01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the ancillary proceeding
 
01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.390 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the ancillary proceeding
language

01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
and participation in proceedings
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
that outside of the delinquency process
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
i think his concern was that that
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
that the language that was inserted in
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
hb 188
 
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
may presume that juvenile defenders
 
01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:50.550 align:start position:0%
may presume that juvenile defenders
could

01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
formally represent kids at say
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
small claims actions that is not the
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know my thought process behind the
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
ancillary proceedings language
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
is to ensure solely that juveniles are
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
entitled to
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
effective and competent counsel i think
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
there's um
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
there's some disagreement on the extent
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
to juvenile representation in
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
proceedings outside of the delinquency
 
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:20.470 align:start position:0%
proceedings outside of the delinquency
process

01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
and as a former public defender and a
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
current practitioner of
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
juvenile law in in civil proceedings i
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
can say that there is this
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
this small area of significant overlap
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
we have a juvenile delinquency statute
 
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.030 align:start position:0%
we have a juvenile delinquency statute
that

01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
says that in order for a petition to be
 
01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.590 align:start position:0%
says that in order for a petition to be
sufficient

01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
a school district has to ensure that it
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
has tried certain approaches and that
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
it has determined whether or not a
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
behavior is
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
is um has a relationship
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
to a child's disability
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
if we say that a juvenile defender
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
can can file a motion
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
that a petition is insufficient but at
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
we bar them from attending a school
 
01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:12.870 align:start position:0%
we bar them from attending a school
proceeding

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
directly related to whether or not the
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
petition is sufficient
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
that is not effective in competent
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
counsel and so
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
in working through this with with
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
justice lynn
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
i thought a lot about some language to
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps tighten
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
um this that section of the bill
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
and and and address some of those
 
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
concerns and i'd be happy to
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
work with um both both representative
 
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
lin and any
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
any members of the committee that would
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
might be interested in working through
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
some of that language
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
um another section that has been
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
highlighted is this appointment at
 
01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.669 align:start position:0%
highlighted is this appointment at
interrogation

01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
interrogation
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
and and again i think that's
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
the i think the main concern that has
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
come up is that the language and the
 
01:14:59.520 --> 01:14:59.910 align:start position:0%
come up is that the language and the
bill

01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
may be too broad and may extend
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
appointment of counsel prior to
 
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
a petition being filed to any form of
 
01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:10.550 align:start position:0%
a petition being filed to any form of
questioning

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
questioning
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
as opposed to custodial interrogation
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
and so i think that again that is an
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
area that
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
um you know i have certainly some ideas
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
on how to
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
work through that language to make it
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
clear that
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
we mean custodial interrogation but in a
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
juvenile centered way
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there are pressures
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
placed on juveniles during police
 
01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.030 align:start position:0%
placed on juveniles during police
questioning

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
questioning
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
in a way that may not be present for
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
adults who are questioned
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
um the third area that i think that it
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
was some disagreement
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
is um repayment of counsel
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
fees and i know that that's an area
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
that the national juvenile defender
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
center really
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
strongly recommended that we eliminate
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
council fees for juveniles the rationale
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
behind that
 
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
is because there are some some pressures
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
that are inherently on juveniles
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
when their parents are paying their
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
bills so if a juvenile
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
um wants to contest a
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
a delinquency petition um
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
there may be some pressure by parents to
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
say look just take responsibility
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
for this plea true don't cost me
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
money and and by eliminating those fees
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
it inherently removes that pressure on
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
juveniles and i will say that in terms
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
of my experience
 
01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes those pressures are really
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
extensive the burdens that juveniles
 
01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.229 align:start position:0%
extensive the burdens that juveniles
feel

01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
feel
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're expressed by
 
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:45.430 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're expressed by
parents

01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
or not can be incredibly significant
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
i've worked with kids who are worried
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
about putting their family
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
deeper into poverty by having these
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
council fees i've worked with kids who
 
01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:58.470 align:start position:0%
council fees i've worked with kids who
have

01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
contemplated suicide because they might
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
get their families deported
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
through their behavior i i've worked
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
with kids who
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
feel these pressures of the juvenile
 
01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.149 align:start position:0%
feel these pressures of the juvenile
system

01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
in ways that are very difficult to
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
understand when you're not in it
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
and eliminating um council fees for
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
juveniles in particular
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
and and eliminating that burden for them
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
is both good practice as highlighted by
 
01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:25.590 align:start position:0%
is both good practice as highlighted by
the

01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
the njdc report and also
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
is um it's not expensive the cost of
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
collecting these fees
 
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
is almost as much as the
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
amount of fees the state collects and i
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact numbers on that
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
but it's nearly a wash so eliminating
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
those fees would
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
would not be um would not be a heavy
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
lift i will say that that was an area
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
of disagreement with with justice lynn
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
that we were not able to overcome but we
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
could certainly con
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
um continue that conversation and i
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
would love to do that
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
in this legislative session to see if we
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
can find those points of agreement
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
with members of this committee and
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully move this
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
forward so that we at least have some
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
that goes into effect in the in the
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
coming months
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions that
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
attorney wandering for your
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh thoughtful and detailed testimony
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh in the issue of uh use of statement
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
or confession of a minor
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
is it not true that the way the statute
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
is drafted
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require that council be
 
01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:49.910 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require that council be
present

01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
before any interrogation it's just
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
that if there is
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
a wish to use the product
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
of interrogation against the juvenile
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
in a court proceeding then the juvenile
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
would have to have had counsel afforded
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh to him or her am i reading that
 
01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.350 align:start position:0%
uh to him or her am i reading that
correctly

01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative barton thank you
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
for that question that's exactly right
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
so in an emergent circumstance it would
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
provide no barrier to law enforcement
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
questioning a juvenile
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
to um learn information
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
that is urgent um and
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
if the juvenile does not have counsel
 
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
present during that questioning you know
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
i think that if we if we tweak with the
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
lang the
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
language and you know and make it
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogation i think some
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
factors would have to be looked at but
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
as the bill is written
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
now and as you know i would propose it
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
be amended
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right there would be no
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
barrier on questioning there would only
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
be a barrier to usage
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
unless it's a council statement
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
and if i could follow up um
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh you you referenced i think it was you
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
that referenced that this might
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
it might have been sarah blodgett about
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
the cost involved
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering if you looked at all to
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
our neighboring state of vermont
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
where i practiced where every juvenile
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
who was interrogated had an opportunity
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
to talk to counsel at virtually no cost
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
to the state simply by having an on-call
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
public defender statewide system where
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
um i know i had to at one night uh
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
every three months uh be available to
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
take those phone calls
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
and and tell the the juvenile not answer
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering if you had looked at
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
other systems which were actually very
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
low or no cost
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh and yet give a bright line which the
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
law likes
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh a bright line for juveniles as to uh
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
the ability to consult with counsel
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
so i i haven't but i will say this
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
um i i will say that practically
 
01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:10.629 align:start position:0%
um i i will say that practically
speaking

01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
having earlier appointment of counsel is
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
more likely to
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
make the system less expensive and i say
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
that under current practice and i also
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
say that because there's another bill
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
sb 94 that may be coming to your
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
committee i'm not sure if it's going to
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
child and family law or this committee
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay that will um that will
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
allow for diversion of more children
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
from the juvenile system entirely
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
and i think the benefit of
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
before counsel petition is ever filed
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
and at
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
the interrogation stage is there's many
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
times that juveniles make mistakes
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
that are technically violations of the
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
law that do not require them
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
to enter the juvenile system at all um
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
and having that earlier appointment of
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
counsel can both
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
help the juvenile understand the various
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
off-ramps and buy into those various
 
01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:10.870 align:start position:0%
off-ramps and buy into those various
off-ramps

01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
off-ramps
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
much earlier in the system than sailing
 
01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:16.639 align:start position:0%
them down the river through juvenile
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
court which is a
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
very intimidating and scary process for
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
many of them
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
and and the other thing i'll say is that
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe this is this is dating myself
 
01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:27.910 align:start position:0%
and maybe this is this is dating myself
and

01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
but you know when i was a kid um
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
and kids went and spoke with law
 
01:22:33.199 --> 01:22:34.470 align:start position:0%
and kids went and spoke with law
enforcement

01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
there were many um
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
options for them you know working with
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in general and having
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
an attorney facilitate a conversation
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
can help um can help the child and law
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement develop creative solutions
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
for diverting a child is it let's you
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
know do some community service
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
is it um you know i'm going to connect
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
you with
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
these various resources you know the law
 
01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.550 align:start position:0%
these various resources you know the law
enforcement

01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
law enforcement will connect the child
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
with various resources
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
and find a creative solution and i think
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of value
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
in having an attorney facilitate that
 
01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:13.430 align:start position:0%
in having an attorney facilitate that
conversation

01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
to help divert the children from the
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
system entirely
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
and certainly in the wake of sb 94
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
and you know a greater greater adherence
 
01:23:23.679 --> 01:23:25.189 align:start position:0%
and you know a greater greater adherence
to

01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
needs assessments and figuring out what
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
is effective
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
for any particular juvenile i think an
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
attorney could
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of value in facilitating
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
that and counseling the child
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of some of the options
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
available to them
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
rather than being an adversary body in
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry mr chairman did you call me
 
01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:55.990 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry mr chairman did you call me
yes

01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you um thank you
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
michelle for
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony and um i just have
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
one more question and i i don't want
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
people to think i'm opposed to this i i
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
like this concept i think this is really
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
important i just want us to do it right
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
um i am concerned one of the other
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
concerns that representative lynn had
 
01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.189 align:start position:0%
concerns that representative lynn had
brought

01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
brought
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
to our attention was confessions to a
 
01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:21.669 align:start position:0%
to our attention was confessions to a
cousin

01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
cousin
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
or a friend he was concerned that they
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
would then in turn not be
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to testify um
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
in court also if a police officer had
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
pulled a child
 
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
a kid over who was driving that the
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
police officer wouldn't be
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
able to say what's in that white baggy
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
or what's
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
what's that white powder in that baggie
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
something to that effect
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
did we come to um
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
some sort of a mutual
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
agreement so that that this doesn't
 
01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.470 align:start position:0%
agreement so that that this doesn't
happen

01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question i think
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's important so that's exactly the
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
issue i was getting
 
01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of um
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps developing an amendment that
 
01:25:10.159 --> 01:25:10.790 align:start position:0%
perhaps developing an amendment that
would

01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
limit the exclusion of juvenile
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
confessions to custodial interrogation
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
and and so i think i think we can
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely get there um you know the the
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
question of what's in that white baggie
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's a little bit more
 
01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:24.709 align:start position:0%
i think that's a little bit more
complicated

01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
because if it's you know a law
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement that is asking that question
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of eliciting a
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
confession to use in court
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
um you know i i think that that
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
particular question
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
would need to be weighed but what but
 
01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:40.070 align:start position:0%
would need to be weighed but what but
again

01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
what i want to go back to is that if
 
01:25:42.719 --> 01:25:43.110 align:start position:0%
what i want to go back to is that if
there

01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
is um you know if there's a question of
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
where's the body
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
where you know law enforcement needs to
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
know right now where something is
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
there is not a limitation on asking the
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
juvenile that
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
eliciting an answer the only limitation
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
would be on use of court
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
now does law enforcement need to know
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
right in that moment
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
you know what's in the baggie i think
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
that is that type of question is more
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
um designed to elicit a
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
an incriminatory response as opposed to
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
something that is urgent um to prevent
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
harm to a person so you know i i think
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
there may continue to be some
 
01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.189 align:start position:0%
there may continue to be some
disagreement

01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
disagreement
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
on whether or not that's a fair question
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
and then use in court but i do think
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
with a limitation on custodial
 
01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:35.990 align:start position:0%
with a limitation on custodial
interrogation

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
interrogation
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
we get to a much more comfortable place
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
great i agree thank you thank you any
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative lorenzo
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:10.719 align:start position:0%
there we go thank you thank you mr
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you michelle and
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
my question is around um
 
01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.830 align:start position:0%
my question is around um
[Music]

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
the term juvenile delinquent and this is
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
very broad but it is
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
an impression that i had when i was
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
reading over
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
this spill and i think that the term
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
juvenile delinquent
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
is stigmatizing and it's archaic
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
in view of the social science that we
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
now have considering
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
why kids go just just go astray
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
and i think that the term could be
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
impede the rehabilitation of of the
 
01:27:46.719 --> 01:27:48.149 align:start position:0%
impede the rehabilitation of of the
child

01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
um we know that um especially in the
 
01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.070 align:start position:0%
um we know that um especially in the
community

01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know a child that's
 
01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
a juvenile offender who's been like
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
called a juvenile delinquent that impact
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
impacts the kids standing in the
 
01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:05.830 align:start position:0%
impacts the kids standing in the
community

01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
in this school in their neighborhood um
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
and it places a stamp on them
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the reasons why some kids go astray
 
01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:17.430 align:start position:0%
and the reasons why some kids go astray
is

01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
because of disability or mental health
 
01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.149 align:start position:0%
because of disability or mental health
issues

01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
um and that term will stick with the
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
child for the rest of their
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
their life i think that we know through
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
social science research that there are
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
multiple reasons
 
01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
why kids get into the juvenile justice
 
01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.870 align:start position:0%
why kids get into the juvenile justice
system

01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's not the child's fault
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes it has to do with a family
 
01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.390 align:start position:0%
sometimes it has to do with a family
environment

01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
and those environmental issues could
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
include mental health issues in the
 
01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:52.550 align:start position:0%
include mental health issues in the
family

01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
court involvement of the family and then
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
substance misuse
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
issues in the family but um
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
the term juvenile delinquent was kind of
 
01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
a turn off for me and i just wanted to
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
raise that concern
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative de
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
lorenzo i will point out that the term
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
troop now delinquent actually has a very
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
specific definition
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
it means that a child has committed an
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
offense that
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
would be a misdemeanor or felony if
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
committed by the
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
by an adult and that the child is in
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
need of services i don't disagree with
 
01:29:24.719 --> 01:29:25.030 align:start position:0%
need of services i don't disagree with
you

01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
on you know the stigmatizing effect and
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
i encourage
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
this committee to take a very strong
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
look at sb 94 when it comes over
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
because the purpose of that bill is to
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
limit juveniles from entering the
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
juvenile system and acquiring that label
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
and i think it it's the result of a lot
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
of really exciting work that is another
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
another talk for another day
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
um i know this would the term juvenile
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
delinquent appears in lots of places in
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
the law and then we've got the whole
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
you know political climate everybody's
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
upset about wokeness and cancer culture
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
and stuff and you know
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
we have a rather strange thing that's in
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
the house budget though i don't know if
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
that's going to pass but
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh what specific question is would it be
 
01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
worthwhile either through
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
this bill or sb941 to perhaps
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
redefine and maybe even rename juvenile
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
delinquency so it's
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
just uh i know obviously anytime you do
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be a certain
 
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
amount of what they call
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
dysphemism creep where like you create a
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
new euphemism for something and then it
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
becomes a pessimism a bad word but would
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
it be worthwhile to
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps rename and redefine the concept
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i don't i i
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
don't know that i have an answer on that
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
um i think that's a beyond the scope of
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
of what i've thought about this bill but
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's an interesting question
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative rice
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um you know to be
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
quite honest i think anything that we
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
changed the name from
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
in three years is going to offend
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
someone i think we need to stick to the
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
importance of this bill
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
and work on getting this passed rather
 
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
than working on changing a name that in
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
three years
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to be offended by and
 
01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
find demeaning
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
and then we have to change it again i
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
would really just like to see us
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
work on this bill and get it right so
 
01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
that these kids have counsel
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
right away and not worry about the word
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
delinquent which
 
01:31:43.110 --> 01:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
in juvenile offender could offend
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
someone or put a stigma on them
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
you know but i think we're getting way
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
off base as to
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill okay
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry again anybody can submit an
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
amendment if they
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
want but we'll keep our focus where
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
it needs to be so okay

of senate bill 143 my testimony will be
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
very brief because i think that
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
um your conversation with michelle
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
wongan has really covered
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
much of the territory in a in i think a
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
pretty comprehensive way um michelle and
 
01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:05.350 align:start position:0%
pretty comprehensive way um michelle and
i

01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
are members of a group known as the
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
juvenile reform project which
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
includes my office her office the aclu
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
waypoint and new futures we've been
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
working for a number of years on
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
a variety of juvenile delinquency reform
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
efforts i i think that
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
i will just briefly touch on a couple of
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
that may not have been discussed in
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
earlier in the hearing
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
the immediate appointment of counsel is
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
a very important
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that i'm giving
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
that would be in section one there there
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
it is right at the beginning um
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
basically the point here is that many
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
things happen at the first appearance in
 
01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.390 align:start position:0%
things happen at the first appearance in
court

01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
and current new hampshire practice does
 
01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:05.669 align:start position:0%
and current new hampshire practice does
not

01:34:05.669 --> 01:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
really provide for the immediate
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
appointment of counsel unless a child is
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
actually in custody
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
um and is going to be held in custody
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
for some extended period of time
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
and a lot happens at that first
 
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
appearance and it's important
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
for families and children to have
 
01:34:20.639 --> 01:34:22.310 align:start position:0%
for families and children to have
assistance

01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
at that first appearance it actually can
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
end up being a time saver and a resource
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
saver for everyone involved because
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes cases that are minor in nature
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
can be resolved quickly
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
reducing the need for a return
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
appearance of a police officer a
 
01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:38.550 align:start position:0%
appearance of a police officer a
prosecutor

01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
prosecutor
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
family taking time off from work
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
children taking time off from school etc
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
the the provision that provides for
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
um for um
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
council to be appointed um and that
 
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
waiver is not permitted unless
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
that this is section three that that
 
01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.629 align:start position:0%
that this is section three that that
basically

01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
a child can't waive their right to
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
counsel unless they have a
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to consult with a lawyer
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
about the consequences of that waiver
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
that's the national standard we've been
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
slowly incrementally moving towards
 
01:35:14.229 --> 01:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
adoption of that standard for certain
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
categories of kids
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
um most prominently kids with just with
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
sort of recognized disabilities
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
um and this would basically say look
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
let's just go the whole way
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
we're gonna appoint council immediately
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
in these cases if the if at some point
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
the child wants to waive counsel that
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
has to happen
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
after they've had a chance to talk to a
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
lawyer about the consequences of it
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
the last thing i'll mention is the flat
 
01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
fee provision
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
which is the section is section
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
five on page three of the bill um
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
as i'm sure you know um the the
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
compensation for lawyers for poor people
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
is pretty low and that in and of itself
 
01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
regardless of how it's structured
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
creates a disincentive to work on these
 
01:35:57.119 --> 01:35:57.669 align:start position:0%
creates a disincentive to work on these
cases

01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
if you have other higher paying cases
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know in the office
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
and so we in new hampshire we compound
 
01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:05.189 align:start position:0%
and so we in new hampshire we compound
that

01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
by basically saying you're going to get
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
the same amount of money if you work one
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
hour on a case or if you work 10 hours
 
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
on a case
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
and so we really have a doubly
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know poorly structured system
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
and it's particularly dangerous i think
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
cases involving children with which can
 
01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
um involve
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of complexity because
 
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities are much more
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
likely to be court involved
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
they can be involved in multiple service
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
systems that they can be complex
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
that in in the complexity is not often
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
really directly tied to the seriousness
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
of the actual charge so
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's a very important
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
provision as well um i will leave it at
 
01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:46.390 align:start position:0%
provision as well um i will leave it at
that

01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
you've got a lot to talk about and i'd
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
there we go thank you sorry about that
 
01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:06.870 align:start position:0%
there we go thank you sorry about that
um

01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
mr skibby real quick question on when we
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
had hb 188 did we not amend that to
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
hourly for the attorney fees
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
yes there was a very similar but
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
slightly different provision
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
in uh the 188 language it actually
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
provided for an hourly rate
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
this this basically um
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
gives a little bit more flexibility as
 
01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
to how it could be structured you could
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
have sort of a phased
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
compensation under this language whereas
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
188 required an
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
hourly rate um i think we can live with
 
01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:38.709 align:start position:0%
hourly rate um i think we can live with
either

01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up i'm sure mr chairman just
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
really quickly okay so that's
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
that's my concern what's going to give
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
the kids the best representation
 
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
what's going to make sure that
 
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
they're not being pushed aside for the
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
higher paying cases
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
which which part do you think will work
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
better i think that um
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
probably the most reliable way to do it
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
to ensure that lawyers don't have the
 
01:38:07.199 --> 01:38:08.229 align:start position:0%
to ensure that lawyers don't have the
disincentive

01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
disincentive
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
of not getting paid for each additional
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
effort that they put into it is to go
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
with the hourly rates um i
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know there are ways of structuring
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
these kinds of contracts that
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
are not truly flat fees but where you
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
say okay if the case is resolved at this
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
stage it's one fee
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
if it's resolved at some later
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
procedural point in the case it's
 
01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:30.159 align:start position:0%
another fee
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
um those um are still imperfect
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
because it still creates the
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
disincentive to work
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
to work more on each stage of the case
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat better than the actual
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
flat fee but i think the hourly
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
rate is probably the best way to go okay
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
great thank you so much
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%

01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
of the bill about the national guard
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
enlistment uh recruiting

plan uh general micheladas did a fine
 
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
job so i'm not going to
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time on that i'm just
 
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
going to tell you all that we we do
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
and the the the fund that used to exist
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
they're creating this new fund and
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the old one
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
that fund was primarily used for things
 
01:39:50.639 --> 01:39:51.270 align:start position:0%
that fund was primarily used for things
like

01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
if a if a recruit wanted to get a cdl
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
license or something there that wasn't
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
really covered by the university system
 
01:39:58.950 --> 01:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
and they found that there really wasn't
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of of uh
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
of call for that and so that's why
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're going this other
 
01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.109 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're going this other
direction

01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
but the only thing i wanted to tell you
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
is that our members do support this

01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
my name is richard head i'm the
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
government affairs coordinator for the
 
01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:50.070 align:start position:0%
government affairs coordinator for the

judicial
 
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
branch um and before i begin you should
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
also have
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
margaret huang who signed up to testify
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
and for some reason doesn't sound like
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
it made it to your list she was going to
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
speak to part three
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 143 i was going to speak
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
to in support of sections 4 5
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
6 and 7. and mr chairman i'll
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
take it as as is your preference if you
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
would prefer that i pause between each
 
01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.430 align:start position:0%
would prefer that i pause between each
part

01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
and answer questions or if you would
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
prefer me to go through all the sections
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
and then answer questions at the end
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh whichever is your preference why
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't you go through each part
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
and stop and ask if there are any
 
01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:31.270 align:start position:0%
and stop and ask if there are any
questions

01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
perfect so i'll begin with part four
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
which is on page six of the bill this
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
the administrative judge of the circuit
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
court or the supreme court uh
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
chief justice to appoint or actually
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
there's the administrator
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
administrative judge to appoint referees
 
01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
to any
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
uncontested matter of certain types in
 
01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.109 align:start position:0%
uncontested matter of certain types in
probate

01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
probate
 
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh and those are specifically probate of
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
wills and granting the administration on
 
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
on all matters
 
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
and name changes this would uh
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
essentially allow some more efficiency
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
within the
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
within the probate court to allow the
 
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
referees to be able to issue orders
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
they're working under the supervision of
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
a probate judge
 
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
and if there is a request for
 
01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:22.310 align:start position:0%
and if there is a request for
reconsideration

01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
reconsideration
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
that request for reconsideration would
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
be reviewed by
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
a judge not the referee uh and just
 
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh to go back and remind the committee a
 
01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.390 align:start position:0%
uh to go back and remind the committee a
referee

01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
referee
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
is a a judge who has retired at age 70
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
and is no longer qualified to sit as a
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
judge but can sit as a referee
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
and this would simply allow them to
 
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
issue orders in any uncontested matter
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
where there was no objection
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
of any of the parties part four also
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
would repeal
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
a provision that puts the exclusive
 
01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:55.189 align:start position:0%
a provision that puts the exclusive
jurisdiction

01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
of termination of parental rights in
 
01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:58.790 align:start position:0%
of termination of parental rights in
probate

01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
probate
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
because it is it should be in fact
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
expanded beyond that
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
to where it's primarily in the family
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
division now
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
and with that i will pause and be happy
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative mclean yeah uh thank you
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you for taking your
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
questions it's just a quick question
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
so um just sausage making
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
so if it's not contested i do see on
 
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
impart forces
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
um any party agreed by the decision
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
so i'm just kind of wondering how that
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
would come about to be if you have a
 
01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:36.709 align:start position:0%
would come about to be if you have a
will

01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's uncontested that you would have
 
01:43:41.189 --> 01:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
someone that was aggrieved by the
 
01:43:41.199 --> 01:43:41.830 align:start position:0%
someone that was aggrieved by the
decision

01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
so how do you make the determination
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
that it's uncontested and how might such
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
a situation arise
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's probably rare or
 
01:43:51.990 --> 01:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
unlikely but
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
even in an uncontested matter the judge
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
may include something in an order
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
that a party simply disagrees with or
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
was unexpected at the beginning
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
and may put something in the in the
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
order that was not
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps originally contemplated at the
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
time uh
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
that the matter was was initially being
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
considered i think
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
i think it's unlikely and rare but it's
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
it you always have to have
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
an off-ramp for for any party once they
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
actually receive an order
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
to uh to be able to take some some
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
additional step
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh and that just seems to be a good
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
safety valve just on the off chance that
 
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:30.870 align:start position:0%
safety valve just on the off chance that
something

01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
unexpected shows up in the order that
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
was otherwise uncontested
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative oregon um yes
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
i'd like
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
i'd like to delve a little bit more into
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
section two of part four about taking
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights cases out
 
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
of the probate court i
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
unders i see there i certainly um i'm
 
01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
certainly not surprised to hear that
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
they're mostly done in the family
 
01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:56.950 align:start position:0%
they're mostly done in the family
division

01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
but uh what's what's the problem with
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
also allowing the probate court to deal
 
01:45:04.149 --> 01:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
with it and also currently what sort of
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
probate courses um cases do have
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
determination of parental rights as an
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
issue in them and how would
 
01:45:13.590 --> 01:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
and is there any disadvantage to letting
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
the probate court continue to deal
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
whatever those situations are
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
going forward rather than bringing the
 
01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
family division
 
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.270 --> 01:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
it actually doesn't prohibit the current
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
language makes them the exclusive
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so it just
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
it broadens it now that we have a
 
01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
with three divisions it just it it takes
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
out the exclusive jurisdiction
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
language but doesn't create a
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
prohibition okay so
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
yes so you're saying follow-up um
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's basically it's unnecessary because
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
they're just two divisions of the same
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
court at the moment anyways in fact
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's right it might be the same judge
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
might just
 
01:45:59.590 --> 01:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
put on his or her like take off his or
 
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
her family division hat
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
put on her probate half and then
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
somebody i guess might even be the same
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
judge in many cases
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
like big big part of it it could be so
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
it really is just a clean up
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
to to eliminate that exclusive
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction language okay
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
01:46:15.679 --> 01:46:17.510 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
langley

01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
langley
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
now that i understand what a referee is
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not clear why that person would need
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
supervision by another judge
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
um as they've been a judge for a
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
significant period of time and
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
i would expect they have bring a certain
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
level of expertise
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
they thank you for the question they
 
01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely do bring a level of expertise
 
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
um but currently uh
 
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
by a constitution they are no longer
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to sit as a judge
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh after age seventy so they are it's a
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
mandatory retirement at age 70.
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
so this so because because they are not
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
continue to be as a judge after age 70
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
they have to be under the supervision of
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
a judge
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
but you're absolutely right the the
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
point here is
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
you have a number of very experienced uh
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
judicial officers who
 
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
can absolutely write these orders but
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
currently they all have to be
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh signed off by a judge and it really
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
is a an unnecessary step
 
01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
for the most part in in these types of
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
cases where
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
where they're uncontested it just
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
consumes additional judicial resources
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily but it does as we
 
01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned before at least provide a
 
01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:36.159 align:start position:0%
a safety valve on the off chance that
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
there's some disagreement about what is
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
contained in that referee's order
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
that it could then be reviewed by um by
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
a current judge
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and and thank you
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
attorney head for taking my question
 
01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
your last answer raised a question for
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
me and that is
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
is this an end run in some respect
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
around the mandatory retirement age
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
for judges no it's an it's a
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
i i would not phrase it that way
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
currently the statutes
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
allow for referees um once you are
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
beyond your age 70 mandatory retirement
 
01:48:27.119 --> 01:48:28.550 align:start position:0%
beyond your age 70 mandatory retirement
age

01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
age
 
01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
what this does is simply provides
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
the the orders can be issued by the
 
01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.270 align:start position:0%
the the orders can be issued by the
referee

01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
referee
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
with further review if necessary it just
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
avoids every order
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
from a referee needing to be reviewed
 
01:48:42.639 --> 01:48:43.189 align:start position:0%
from a referee needing to be reviewed
and

01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:46.629 --> 01:48:46.639 align:start position:0%
signed off for by a on the document
 
01:48:46.639 --> 01:48:47.669 align:start position:0%
signed off for by a on the document
itself

01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
on every order it it just is a
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
judicial efficiency question but does
 
01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:55.270 align:start position:0%
judicial efficiency question but does
not

01:48:55.270 --> 01:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
allow the the referee to be acting as a
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
judge because they're always under the
 
01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:00.070 align:start position:0%
judge because they're always under the
supervision

01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
of a judge and there's always the
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a judge
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
to then review it upon the request of
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
any party
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
and an issue a separate order
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rice thank you
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you mr head for taking
 
01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
um so this is for uncontested cases
 
01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:26.070 align:start position:0%
um so this is for uncontested cases
correct

01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
that's correct so follow up um
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
so just
 
01:49:34.709 --> 01:49:34.719 align:start position:0%
i guess out of my own curiosity any
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
party agreed
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
by a decision why would there be a party
 
01:49:39.669 --> 01:49:39.679 align:start position:0%
aggrieved by a decision if it's
 
01:49:39.679 --> 01:49:41.189 align:start position:0%
aggrieved by a decision if it's
uncontested

01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
uncontested
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and i think that's that's a similar
 
01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
question as as we had before
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
really very very unlikely and and the
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
goal here is just to make sure
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's probably overly uh
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
careful but just on the chance that
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the fact it is
 
01:49:57.840 --> 01:49:59.430 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the fact it is
uncontested

01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
uncontested
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
one of the when the when the actual
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
order is being reviewed and read by the
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
parties they see something that was
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
surprising to them
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
that was not expected when they were
 
01:50:09.990 --> 01:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
when they were
 
01:50:12.149 --> 01:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
essentially bringing the matter it gives
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
them a chance to have a judge look at it
 
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
and say
 
01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
hey that was not what we had expected so
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
can you please look at this
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
very unlikely scenario but at least it
 
01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
gives that
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
option one more follow-up if i may mr
 
01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:26.550 align:start position:0%
option one more follow-up if i may mr
chairman

01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
um so what um
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.709 --> 01:50:38.719 align:start position:0%
ah what's the word i want to use um so
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
so these are retired judges what let's
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
say continuing education and competency
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
going forward do they have to
 
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
like i don't i don't know how do we make
 
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
sure that they're still okay
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
at 73. how do we do you know what i mean
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
does that
 
01:50:57.910 --> 01:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
make any sense to you it does and and i
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
just need to pull up the
 
01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
within the the provision that uh
 
01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:02.070 align:start position:0%
within the the provision that uh
provides

01:51:02.070 --> 01:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
provides
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
for uh referees essentially they would
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
they would continue on as referees
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
they're required to
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
um truth i don't
 
01:51:15.589 --> 01:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
i need to pull up the language that's uh
 
01:51:15.599 --> 01:51:16.070 align:start position:0%
i need to pull up the language that's uh
that's

01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
in the referee section so this bill this
 
01:51:19.990 --> 01:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
would not
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
address the referee sort of requirements
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
um i just need to find it and i
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
apologize i didn't have that pulled out
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
it was just more out of curiosity i
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
understand that this section won't
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
affect that but we do want to still make
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
like at 73 are they still okay to make
 
01:51:40.639 --> 01:51:41.990 align:start position:0%
like at 73 are they still okay to make
these

01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
these unilateral decisions so to speak
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean i'm not trying to
 
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
be mean but we
 
01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
yeah well no i get that and that's why
 
01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
no i and and certainly that type of
 
01:51:52.719 --> 01:51:53.430 align:start position:0%
no i and and certainly that type of
issue

01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
came up with the bills that were both in
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
the senate in the house regarding the
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
retirement age
 
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
um of judges and whether or not that
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh stricken in that in in at all times
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh as is currently true they would be
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
acting under the supervision of a judge
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
so if there is any problem in terms of
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh of of the capacity of a referee
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
that issue just has to be addressed
 
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
through the administrative judge
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not they are allowed to
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
and should be allowed to continue
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
sitting as a referee
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
um so they that that review is is a part
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
of sort of the
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
the duties of the the judge that is
 
01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:33.910 align:start position:0%
the duties of the the judge that is
actually

01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
working with the referee i mean that
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
particular court wherever that court is
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
the um that judge who's who's
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
in charge of that court would would be
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
the one to make that evaluation
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much uh just for
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
clarification purposes
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh attorney attorney head not all
 
01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:55.669 align:start position:0%
uh attorney attorney head not all
referees

01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
referees
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
are retired judges oh yeah fair point
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
and uh some some referees are
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
are senior judges who have retired
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
before age 70
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
and are allowed to continue in in
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
essentially a per diem
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
capacity um so so at some level there
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
are some judges who
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh who are not post 70.
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
and i thought actually in correct me i'm
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
wrong mr chairman i thought they were
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
actually referred to as senior judges
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
and not as referees but maybe i'm wrong
 
01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
people who are acting as referees who
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
is that true in the probate language
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the probate section of the statute i
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
don't i thought
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
i thought the referee was was a post-70
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
judge i have to say that i
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
appear and you would have more
 
01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
experience than that so i i'll defer to
 
01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:55.990 align:start position:0%
experience than that so i i'll defer to
you

01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
within the last year appeared in front
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
of a referee in the probate division
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
okay my fault then my error um
 
01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh represent mclean it's a just a quick
 
01:54:11.599 --> 01:54:12.070 align:start position:0%
uh represent mclean it's a just a quick
question

01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
as to need so i'm assuming the intention
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
of this is to be able to
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
to divert the the uncontested things
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
kind of get a fast track going
 
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
so if i look at what is the current
 
01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:24.550 align:start position:0%
so if i look at what is the current
state

01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:54:27.669 --> 01:54:27.679 align:start position:0%
of processing these probate cases
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
and has any analysis been done as to how
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
this might
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
impact that current process would be the
 
01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:35.189 align:start position:0%
impact that current process would be the
referee

01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
referee
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
makes a recommendation that is then
 
01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:38.709 align:start position:0%
makes a recommendation that is then
reviewed

01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
and approved uh and ordered by
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
a sitting judge um the
 
01:54:48.790 --> 01:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
and and the process would be to divert
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
those that are uncontested with a
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
referee to allow the referee
 
01:54:56.070 --> 01:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
to issue the order without that
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
requirement that every one of them is
 
01:54:58.159 --> 01:55:00.229 align:start position:0%
requirement that every one of them is
reviewed

01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
and ultimately issued by
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
by a setting judge i don't have numbers
 
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh it is you know there are a decent
 
01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
number of them they do take up
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh judicial time but i honestly i did
 
01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:15.350 align:start position:0%
uh judicial time but i honestly i did
not

01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
i don't have a statistics today
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
although i'd be happy to get some as to
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
how many referee orders are signed off
 
01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:23.589 align:start position:0%
how many referee orders are signed off
by

01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh by judges and ultimately issued by
 
01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:26.709 align:start position:0%
uh by judges and ultimately issued by
judges

01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
judges
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
well i'm afraid i answered my question
 
01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
ask my question
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
poorly i'm just wondering as to the need
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
is is there is there a significant
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
backlog that this is being brought in to
 
01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:38.229 align:start position:0%
backlog that this is being brought in to
address

01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
um and just trying to get a feel for
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
that i know
 
01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know it is it's an efficiency so um
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's essentially able to free up the
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
sitting judge to work
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
on other orders instead of
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
going through the review of a referee's
 
01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:56.310 align:start position:0%
going through the review of a referee's
order

01:55:56.310 --> 01:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
and ultimately signing up
 
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
signing it as an order from that judge
 
01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:02.870 align:start position:0%
signing it as an order from that judge
um

01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
it it so it's not you know it's not
 
01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
specifically addressing a particular
 
01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:09.430 align:start position:0%
specifically addressing a particular
backlog

01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
backlog
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
um per se it is you know there's always
 
01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
a very high demand
 
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
of judicial time so it's a way of just
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
trying to free up a little bit
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
of time for sitting judges
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative simpson
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
attorney head for taking my question
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering um to the question
 
01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:35.990 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering um to the question
previous

01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
question from the last one is it often
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
that people raise concerns about the
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
abilities of
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
retirees or senior judges or maybe more
 
01:56:47.669 --> 01:56:47.679 align:start position:0%
more accurate what i want to ask is how
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
often do people raise concerns about
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
retirees or senior judges
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
i could just inquire the issue really
 
01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:03.430 align:start position:0%
i could just inquire the issue really
here

01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
is an economic decision because
 
01:57:10.229 --> 01:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
currently you're required to have a
 
01:57:10.239 --> 01:57:10.950 align:start position:0%
currently you're required to have a
judge

01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
which you pay a judge's 164
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
000 a year plus retirement benefits
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
and other benefits where
 
01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0%
you can hire referees for
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
substantially less and not have to
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
pay them retirement benefits is that
 
01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:34.470 align:start position:0%
pay them retirement benefits is that
correct

01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
certainly that is that is a part of it i
 
01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
think really the primary
 
01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
motivating element was was the
 
01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:41.350 align:start position:0%
motivating element was was the
efficiency

01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
of the sitting judges in the time
 
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
they're currently taking but certainly
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
because otherwise you could solve the
 
01:57:54.070 --> 01:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
problem by having more judges
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
we can always we that's true that's fair
 
01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:00.870 align:start position:0%
we can always we that's true that's fair
correct

01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
unless there are other questions i think
 
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
we move on to part five
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
excellent part five is
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
um largely clarifying or fixing a little
 
01:58:13.750 --> 01:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
issue in the current setup currently a
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
supreme court justice
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
can sit in the superior court but the
 
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
statute does not provide
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
a mechanism to go directly from the
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
supreme court as a justice to sit
 
01:58:23.679 --> 01:58:25.270 align:start position:0%
supreme court as a justice to sit
temporarily

01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
temporarily
 
01:58:28.149 --> 01:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
on some circuit court matters this
 
01:58:28.159 --> 01:58:29.669 align:start position:0%
on some circuit court matters this
simply

01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:29.679 align:start position:0%
simply
 
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
expands the opportunity for a supreme
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
court justice
 
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to sit in either superior
 
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
court or circuit court
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
as a particular need may arise in
 
01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
addressing representative rice's earlier
 
01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:45.189 align:start position:0%
addressing representative rice's earlier
question

01:58:45.189 --> 01:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
quite a little while ago the
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
um the issue of of what would happen if
 
01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
if a
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
case were appealed to the supreme court
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
from the circuit court that that a
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
supreme court justice would
 
01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
sit had set on obviously that justice
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
would be recused
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
from that appeal um it would not sit on
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
the appeal of
 
01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
of their own order within the statute
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
in the current language relative to the
 
01:59:13.990 --> 01:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
um it has to be that that the
 
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
designation is either by the chief
 
01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:19.030 align:start position:0%
designation is either by the chief
justice

01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
justice
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
or the senior associate um justice of
 
01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
has to be in a manner that is not
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
inconsistent this is the language out of
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
the statute currently
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
not inconsistent with the proper
 
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
advancement of the business of the
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
so the the you know whether or not it's
 
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
going to have an ultimate impact on the
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
supreme court's operation is a
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
is a consideration um and
 
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
for them you know for the most part
 
01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:44.390 align:start position:0%
for them you know for the most part
there

01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
um the issue would be addressed if there
 
01:59:49.830 --> 01:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
were an appeal
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
by a recusal by that justice when it's
 
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
heard by the supreme court
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll pause and and be
 
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
02:00:00.229 --> 02:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
questions regarding part five of the
 
02:00:00.239 --> 02:00:01.109 align:start position:0%
questions regarding part five of the
bill

02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none um
 
02:00:12.070 --> 02:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so turning to part six
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
part six is um
 
02:00:18.070 --> 02:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
with regard to payment of costs for
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
services other than counsel for indigent
 
02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:21.270 align:start position:0%
services other than counsel for indigent
parties

02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
parties
 
02:00:24.070 --> 02:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
this also is a clarification of existing
 
02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:25.510 align:start position:0%
this also is a clarification of existing
law

02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
currently indigent council fees
 
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
are paid through the judicial council
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
which is not a part of the judicial
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
branch but is a separate agency
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
that is general funded and pays for the
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
the costs uh of certain fees
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
as is ordered by the the court so
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
um one thing i know in section six of
 
02:00:48.629 --> 02:00:48.639 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
as it is coming off of at least the
 
02:00:51.199 --> 02:00:52.149 align:start position:0%
as it is coming off of at least the
website

02:00:52.149 --> 02:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
website
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't actually show the changes uh
 
02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
when you read the bill it's all
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh neutral it doesn't have a bold it
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an underline
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
so it's a little bit awkward it's it's
 
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
not entirely new
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh each of these sections has an
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
additional sec
 
02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
part to it and and truthfully i don't
 
02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
know what happened the same thing was
 
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
true over in the senate
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
um but the first part deals with
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
it and as an aside the reason why this
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
is important
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
is because if there's ambiguity in the
 
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
statute or there's any
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh uncertainty in the statute the
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
would have to pay for it unless there's
 
02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
some express
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
requirement for the payment to be
 
02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
through the
 
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
judicial council and really the intent
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
of this uh
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
what's always been here is that these
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
fees are paid by the judicial council
 
02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
so for example in the in the first
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
section um
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the costs of a
 
02:01:47.109 --> 02:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem and a termination of
 
02:01:48.870 --> 02:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
parental right case
 
02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
the statute is very clear currently that
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
the costs of the gal
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
are are covered but the gal may
 
02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:57.270 align:start position:0%
are are covered but the gal may
themselves

02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
have costs associated with their work
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
including the hiring of experts or
 
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
investigative fees or some other
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
service that may be necessary for
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
for their work in all of those things as
 
02:02:12.070 --> 02:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
a as a collective package would
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
should be paid through the judicial
 
02:02:14.719 --> 02:02:15.270 align:start position:0%
should be paid through the judicial
council

02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
not by the judicial branch same thing
 
02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
with the next section dealing with
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
costs of legal counsel those legal
 
02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
counsel hire investigators higher
 
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
experts and have other services
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
that are necessary to provide adequate
 
02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:29.669 align:start position:0%
that are necessary to provide adequate
representation

02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
representation
 
02:02:31.830 --> 02:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
and again we're just making explicit in
 
02:02:32.950 --> 02:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
the in the
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
statute through this bill that those
 
02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
additional costs those investigative
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
costs experts and other services
 
02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
would be uh would be included in what is
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
paid for
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
through the judicial council
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
again same thing with regard to the
 
02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:49.910 align:start position:0%
again same thing with regard to the
other

02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
two sections guardians and conservators
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
and criminal defense
 
02:02:57.030 --> 02:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about sort of making sure
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
all relative and related costs
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
are are packaged together and would be
 
02:03:06.550 --> 02:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll pause and be happy to
 
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
take any questions regarding part six
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
the first question is is the judicial
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
council in agreement with this
 
02:03:22.149 --> 02:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative rice hi thank you again
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i just had a
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
quick question on
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
line eight of page eight my print out i
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's the same as yours
 
02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
where it says adequate representation
 
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
for indigent defendants in criminal
 
02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:43.270 align:start position:0%
for indigent defendants in criminal
cases

02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
neglected or abused children can you
 
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
clarify that for me a little bit because
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
defendants in criminal cases would
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused so i just need a
 
02:03:56.709 --> 02:03:56.719 align:start position:0%
little clarification
 
02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
yep these are um abuse and neglect cases
 
02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:00.149 align:start position:0%
yep these are um abuse and neglect cases
where

02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
the there's a defendant that has been
 
02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:03.679 align:start position:0%
charged with abuse of do
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
or neglect of a minor um and those
 
02:04:08.709 --> 02:04:08.719 align:start position:0%
defendants are what we're talking about
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
who are who are entitled
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
to um to counsel
 
02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
or actually i'm actually i let me make
 
02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:17.270 align:start position:0%
or actually i'm actually i let me make
sure

02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
i didn't misspeak sorry uh this may be a
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
guardian i'd light him for
 
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry my fault i spoke too quickly
 
02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
in cases involving neglected abused
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
children when a guardian ad litem is
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
appointed for the child
 
02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
such appointment is from funds from the
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
indigent defense
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh fund um
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
and then where the parent is where an
 
02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
attorney is appointed to represent a
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
parent determined to be indigent
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
at the preliminary hearing or hearing
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the cost of the appointment
 
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
in there there we're adding the cost of
 
02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:52.069 align:start position:0%
in there there we're adding the cost of
council

02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
the investigative costs and related
 
02:04:54.719 --> 02:04:58.069 align:start position:0%
the investigative costs and related
expenses

02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
and then the council would would be
 
02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
petitioning the the
 
02:05:05.109 --> 02:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
um the court okay
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you so much yes
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
oh thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:05:12.639 --> 02:05:13.830 align:start position:0%
oh thank you thank you for taking my
question

02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
mr herd on i'm just curious about
 
02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
where the funds are coming from and if
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's in here and i don't know i'm not a
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
financial person
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
um yeah where where does is this
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
in the budget or is this something that
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
fees uh charge saved by
 
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
paying fines sure so thank you for the
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
question this is
 
02:05:41.589 --> 02:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh the um judicial council
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
is almost entirely general funded so
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's budget
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
money um they may have and sheriff she's
 
02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:50.719 align:start position:0%
still on could answer
 
02:05:52.390 --> 02:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
um sarah blodgett might be honest or
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
more specifically they they may have
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
some other
 
02:05:57.189 --> 02:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
um grant money but for the most part i
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
think it's general funded through the
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
through the biennial budget and up
 
02:06:05.270 --> 02:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and is
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if there is a note on
 
02:06:10.550 --> 02:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
here but how much money is actually used
 
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
um do you have any idea wait i'm sorry
 
02:06:17.109 --> 02:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
i don't have sort of the annual cost of
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
of these um i could certainly work with
 
02:06:21.199 --> 02:06:21.830 align:start position:0%
of these um i could certainly work with
sarah

02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
sarah
 
02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
to see what it is but i don't know today
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
i apologize that's okay i was just
 
02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
okay representative horrigan
 
02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you mr attorney head uh
 
02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
my question is about um
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
tell us about paying the cost of a casa
 
02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
guardian that lie appointment child or
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
other guardian enlightenment so
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
the there's another guardian little item
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
they're typically an attorney or some
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
other professional so they pay you know
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
they charge a rate that's uh you know
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
commensurate with the
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
market value of their services but then
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
but with the casa
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
i think the actual guardian that like
 
02:07:02.159 --> 02:07:02.870 align:start position:0%
i think the actual guardian that like
them

02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
is a volunteer so what are what are the
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
costs i mean they're
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
i guess you're helping to pay the costs
 
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
the overhead of administering the casa
 
02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:12.470 align:start position:0%
the overhead of administering the casa
program

02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
what are the costs related with a
 
02:07:18.069 --> 02:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
volunteer asset guardian that lie down
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
truthfully i think that's probably a
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
better question
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
for sarah blodgett i don't
 
02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
know exactly how they bill their their
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
serve their their legal services
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
um mr chairman i don't know if you know
 
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
but sarah blaged if she salon would be
 
02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:35.030 align:start position:0%
but sarah blaged if she salon would be
the

02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know that she is immediately
 
02:07:45.119 --> 02:07:47.030 align:start position:0%
i don't know that she is immediately
available

02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:07:50.149 --> 02:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
and i i'm certainly happy to uh
 
02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
circle back with her and and provide the
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
committee with an answer
 
02:07:58.950 --> 02:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions with regard to
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
section six
 
02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
moving on to section seven great um last
 
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
section i was going to be talking on a
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
section seven
 
02:08:16.069 --> 02:08:16.079 align:start position:0%
requiring uh allowing for penalty
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
assessment on violations
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
this again is a clarification um
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
with regard to um
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh penalty assessments when there was a
 
02:08:27.199 --> 02:08:28.310 align:start position:0%
uh penalty assessments when there was a
modification

02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
modification
 
02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
of penalty assess or a penalty from a
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor to a penalty
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
um there became sort of a certain
 
02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
level of uncertainty we wanted to just
 
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
make sure did not exist
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
so this is a clarification of of how we
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
currently interpret
 
02:08:46.709 --> 02:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
the the law which is that penalty
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
assessment can be
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
assessed in a violation um and
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
you know this this just became sort of a
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
question in our
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
our minds that uh when when
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
certain misdemeanors were modified by
 
02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:01.669 align:start position:0%
certain misdemeanors were modified by
statute

02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
in or by bill into a into a violation
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
so this this section just clarifies that
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
in fact they can be assessed
 
02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
on a violation level offense and with
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
that i'd be happy to answer any
 
02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:18.310 align:start position:0%
that i'd be happy to answer any
questions

02:09:18.310 --> 02:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:09:21.669 --> 02:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair thank
 
02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
you attorney head
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
just to clarify this section
 
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
does this section in and of itself
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of uh
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
fee or a penalty in any respect
 
02:09:40.629 --> 02:09:40.639 align:start position:0%
it does not no it just it simply adds
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
the violation
 
02:09:43.669 --> 02:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
but does not change the fee or the the
 
02:09:43.679 --> 02:09:44.950 align:start position:0%
but does not change the fee or the the
calculation

02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you mr chairman just
 
02:09:58.709 --> 02:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
also reiterate margaret huang
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
did register to testify regarding part
 
02:10:03.589 --> 02:10:03.599 align:start position:0%
three so i'm not talking to that section
 
02:10:06.069 --> 02:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
well i don't have her registered to
 
02:10:07.589 --> 02:10:07.599 align:start position:0%
testify that she may be
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
available to testify i don't know she
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
didn't pre-register
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
oh i see she is there i note that
 
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh you're the last representative uh
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
attorney had you the last of the people
 
02:10:22.069 --> 02:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
who pre-registered the testified
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
so there's there's actually a funky
 
02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
little thing in the registration process
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
which i
 
02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
which i believe i now have figured out
 
02:10:30.870 --> 02:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
is if you register
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
as a judicial branch employee it never
 
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
makes it to you if you register
 
02:10:37.589 --> 02:10:37.599 align:start position:0%
as a state agency employee which is how
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
i registered it does make it to you
 
02:10:42.069 --> 02:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm not quite sure what happened and
 
02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's a glitch in the registration
 
02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:44.229 align:start position:0%
there's a glitch in the registration
system

02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
that i i think i've just identified um
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
which i'll talk to the to the clerks
 
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
and we have some people who have been
 
02:10:59.669 --> 02:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
good morning this is francesca hennessey
 
02:11:08.830 --> 02:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
from the department of health and human
 
02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:10.229 align:start position:0%
from the department of health and human
services

02:11:10.229 --> 02:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
i'm testifying in support
 
02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
um the department is in support and
 
02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
actually asked for part two
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
um the main objective of this
 
02:11:22.149 --> 02:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
legislation i i will be brief unless
 
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
there's questions
 
02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
is to allow the department to collect
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
overpayments from
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
a recipient not just by way of
 
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
recruitment which the
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
statute currently um allows for
 
02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
but recipient allows the recipient
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
to affirmatively pay back to the state
 
02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:41.750 align:start position:0%
to affirmatively pay back to the state
um

02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:45.030 --> 02:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
and in fact recipients already do this
 
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
they already want to pay back
 
02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:48.390 align:start position:0%
they already want to pay back
affirmatively

02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
affirmatively
 
02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
um and they asked to do this so it's
 
02:11:53.109 --> 02:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
more of a cleanup of this section
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
and senator gray correctly pointed out
 
02:11:55.920 --> 02:11:56.390 align:start position:0%
and senator gray correctly pointed out
too

02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
that we are also trying to clean up a
 
02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
few other parts of this bill
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry of the statute by allowing
 
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
um failure to report collateral
 
02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
resources to also be a reason to pay
 
02:12:09.910 --> 02:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
back the department
 
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
um we this would also
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
um allow us to hold another individual
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
jointly and severally liable if they
 
02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:21.030 align:start position:0%
jointly and severally liable if they
assisted

02:12:21.030 --> 02:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
assisted
 
02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
in defrauding the state
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
we did consult and come to an agreement
 
02:12:29.109 --> 02:12:29.119 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire legal assistance
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
so that too i hope is agreeable to
 
02:12:34.639 --> 02:12:35.990 align:start position:0%
so that too i hope is agreeable to
everyone

02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
02:12:38.229 --> 02:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
if they're that's all i have to say on
 
02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
our bill again it's really cleaning up
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
so just so i understand this is with
 
02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
recruitment and this is where you may
 
02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:56.229 align:start position:0%
recruitment and this is where you may
have

02:12:56.229 --> 02:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
overpaid or you have paid benefits and
 
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
they have an obligation to reimburse the
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
state for those benefits
 
02:13:06.550 --> 02:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's true that's true representative
 
02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:09.510 align:start position:0%
that's true that's true representative
yep

02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
and this allows them to simply pay you
 
02:13:16.229 --> 02:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
as opposed to you going after their
 
02:13:16.239 --> 02:13:17.669 align:start position:0%
as opposed to you going after their
property

02:13:17.669 --> 02:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:13:20.229 --> 02:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
well it's the statute is worded oddly
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
the statute right now
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
says that the department shall recover
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
by way of adjusting current and future
 
02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
grant amounts
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
and that's it it doesn't allow the
 
02:13:30.719 --> 02:13:32.069 align:start position:0%
and that's it it doesn't allow the
recipient

02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
recipient
 
02:13:34.629 --> 02:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
who especially if we discovered
 
02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
resources they did not
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
report it does not allow the recipient
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
to simply pay back the department
 
02:13:45.910 --> 02:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
um so we're correcting that
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
so if i could just follow up on that you
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
so if they may have committed fraud
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
that gives them the opportunity to pay
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
you back as opposed to being prosecuted
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
oh we would we would still take either
 
02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:04.069 align:start position:0%
oh we would we would still take either
option

02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
option
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
we could still um we could still
 
02:14:12.069 --> 02:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
go after this case administratively or
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
we could refer it to law enforcement for
 
02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
prosecution so that would not change
 
02:14:16.950 --> 02:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
that process
 
02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
would simply allow the individual again
 
02:14:23.109 --> 02:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
whatever way that we pursued this case
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
would allow that individual to
 
02:14:28.870 --> 02:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
pay back by way of money
 
02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
cash a check to the department versus
 
02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
simply saying
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
sure take it out of my future benefits
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
of which i'll be paid and i would note
 
02:14:39.750 --> 02:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
many of these people won't come back
 
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
onto benefits because we did discover
 
02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
representative chase thank you and thank
 
02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
question so just so i'm clear with this
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
these are
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
people is it like a good samaritan thing
 
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
where they're feeling guilty and say oh
 
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
geez i really have all these other
 
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
assets i haven't told you about
 
02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
or are you actually investigating
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
someone that it just doesn't add up
 
02:15:09.599 --> 02:15:10.870 align:start position:0%
someone that it just doesn't add up
properly

02:15:10.870 --> 02:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
properly
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
oh no we're in vet we have a unit here
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
called our special investigations unit
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
and we do investigate these cases and it
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
runs the gamut of
 
02:15:25.270 --> 02:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
people who who we can't prove fraud and
 
02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
who we simply say you were overpaid you
 
02:15:30.149 --> 02:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
may have forgotten to tell us about that
 
02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
individual who has a full-time job who
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
was living in your house with you
 
02:15:36.310 --> 02:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
you may have forgotten to tell us about
 
02:15:37.910 --> 02:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
all your resources but now
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
you were overpaid and you owe the state
 
02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
back money
 
02:15:43.990 --> 02:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
and then it will run all the way to the
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
other side of the gamut where someone
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
intentionally defrauded the department
 
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
and often those cases we do refer to
 
02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
county attorneys
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
and they will go to court
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:24.790 --> 02:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative smith oh thank you
 
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
i could not um unmute myself i'm sorry
 
02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:32.549 align:start position:0%
i could not um unmute myself i'm sorry
um

02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:32.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
if i could um and just further this
 
02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:36.870 align:start position:0%
if i could um and just further this
discussion

02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh with two related questions can you
 
02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
tell me how much money um you have
 
02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:44.070 align:start position:0%
tell me how much money um you have
collected

02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
collected
 
02:16:47.190 --> 02:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium for example
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
and can you tell me how much
 
02:16:53.349 --> 02:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
you pay to operate your special
 
02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
oh those are great questions i am going
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
to have to get back to you because i do
 
02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
not want to lead you astray with um
 
02:17:05.509 --> 02:17:05.519 align:start position:0%
estimated numbers i want to give you
 
02:17:07.349 --> 02:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
exact numbers
 
02:17:09.270 --> 02:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
that would be fine if you could get back
 
02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
um through the chair we would very much
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
and to reiterate your question you would
 
02:17:17.509 --> 02:17:17.519 align:start position:0%
like that for the last buy
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
nem correct well i
 
02:17:23.589 --> 02:17:23.599 align:start position:0%
said biennium because i thought that
 
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
those would be verifiable numbers
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
but if you have um knowing much more
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
about this than i do
 
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
if you have another way to accurately ex
 
02:17:38.309 --> 02:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to the legislature that you
 
02:17:38.319 --> 02:17:38.629 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to the legislature that you
are

02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:17:42.309 --> 02:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
in fact collecting legitimate collecting
 
02:17:46.709 --> 02:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.589 --> 02:17:49.599 align:start position:0%
and this is how it cost you to close
 
02:17:50.870 --> 02:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
02:17:53.589 --> 02:17:53.599 align:start position:0%
that's interesting i just want the facts
 
02:17:53.599 --> 02:17:54.150 align:start position:0%
that's interesting i just want the facts
ma'am

02:17:54.150 --> 02:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
ma'am
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
i i don't want uh to ask you a question
 
02:17:58.870 --> 02:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
if you give me an
 
02:18:03.030 --> 02:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
answer that in any way represents that
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely i will get that to the
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:16.709 --> 02:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much mr
 
02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
chair thank you very much miss hennessy
 
02:18:19.110 --> 02:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
approximately how many people are
 
02:18:27.669 --> 02:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
involved and how complicated operation
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
is it to administer
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
snap and the other benefits programs
 
02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:32.709 align:start position:0%
snap and the other benefits programs
like

02:18:32.709 --> 02:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:18:34.950 --> 02:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
i will say just several years ago i
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
happened to visit the hhs facility and
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
it was a
 
02:18:39.429 --> 02:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
quite a large number of people actually
 
02:18:41.669 --> 02:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
and appropriately so so if you
 
02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
you can either look into that you can
 
02:18:46.150 --> 02:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
either address that now or
 
02:18:47.910 --> 02:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
or like while you're collecting the
 
02:18:49.589 --> 02:18:49.599 align:start position:0%
other information you can collect that
 
02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
information but
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
this gives a general idea at least if
 
02:18:57.030 --> 02:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
possible thank you
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
sure i can certainly speak to staffing
 
02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
six fraud investigators we have
 
02:19:07.349 --> 02:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
two individuals that run
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
claims so that's less um than an
 
02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
investigation a case where we simply
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
um can assess how much needs to be paid
 
02:19:15.679 --> 02:19:16.230 align:start position:0%
um can assess how much needs to be paid
back

02:19:16.230 --> 02:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
but to the department it's not a fraud
 
02:19:21.349 --> 02:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
case uh we also have a paralegal
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
one part-time support staff and we just
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
hired an
 
02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
administrator for the unit so um
 
02:19:31.110 --> 02:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know it varies between staffing
 
02:19:32.950 --> 02:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
between 10 to 12 people
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
total in the unit but in terms of fraud
 
02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
investigators we have six
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you yeah so it's a it's
 
02:19:41.429 --> 02:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
a it's a major
 
02:19:43.990 --> 02:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
and continuously ongoing operation to
 
02:19:46.870 --> 02:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
administer a program like this so
 
02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:58.150 align:start position:0%
administer a program like this so
thanks

02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
you have to unmute
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
no you're still muted still still muted
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry thank you
 
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and attorney
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
hennessey when you're when you're
 
02:20:16.309 --> 02:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
talking about the recoupments
 
02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
does this also include the nursing home
 
02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:19.670 align:start position:0%
does this also include the nursing home
process

02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
and the assessment of people going into
 
02:20:23.429 --> 02:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
it does not representative this is
 
02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:27.590 align:start position:0%
it does not representative this is
simply

02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
simply
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
cases with individuals who have been
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
identified to
 
02:20:34.469 --> 02:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
have been overpaid their food stamps
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
their cash assistance
 
02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
um child care supplements
 
02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
those sorts of practices so no i'm not
 
02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:42.710 align:start position:0%
those sorts of practices so no i'm not
including

02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
including
 
02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
any nursing home supplements in this
 
02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
02:20:48.309 --> 02:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
and it's good to see you it's good to
 
02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
see you too thank you
 
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you miss
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
hennessey for taking my question
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering what the process is
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
when the funds come from the feds
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
to the state and a person has overstated
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
um they have overpayments what's the
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
process for collection is that
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
strictly on the state or do the feds get
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
involved oh sure
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
we um well we do the investigations we
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
have strict oversight by fns
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
who oversees our food stamp program and
 
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
we would
 
02:21:27.510 --> 02:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
um repay the feds i i'm not sure if
 
02:21:28.469 --> 02:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
that's your question
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
the proportion to which they paid in to
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
the benefits that were overpaid
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
so we um we do allocate federal funds
 
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
back to the feds as well
 
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of them assisting we do have
 
02:21:41.349 --> 02:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
monthly calls with them
 
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
they give us ideas they don't actually
 
02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:44.550 align:start position:0%
they give us ideas they don't actually
have

02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
investigators on the ground here with us
 
02:21:51.270 --> 02:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
they do at the federal level if it's a
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
very big case which i haven't been
 
02:21:54.070 --> 02:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
yet they certainly do have an oig their
 
02:21:59.190 --> 02:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
own investigative services which they
 
02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:00.230 align:start position:0%
own investigative services which they
could

02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
take a case investigate a case maybe a

services excuse me
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
starting around 2005 the state of new
 
02:22:54.870 --> 02:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire implemented
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive patient care reporting
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
system which collects statewide
 
02:23:02.309 --> 02:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
emergency medical services incident data
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
to date we have approximately over two
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
and a half million records
 
02:23:08.469 --> 02:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
in the system this data is extremely
 
02:23:08.479 --> 02:23:09.110 align:start position:0%
in the system this data is extremely
important

02:23:09.110 --> 02:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
to the continued progression of
 
02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
emergency medical services
 
02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
by allowing our stakeholders to use new
 
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire specific data
 
02:23:17.429 --> 02:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
to make decisions on how emergency
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
medical care is provided throughout the
 
02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:19.990 align:start position:0%
medical care is provided throughout the
state

02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:23:22.150 --> 02:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
this is used at both the local and state
 
02:23:24.070 --> 02:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
level in the development and updating of
 
02:23:25.750 --> 02:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
new medical procedures in which
 
02:23:28.389 --> 02:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
ems providers are able to conduct
 
02:23:28.399 --> 02:23:29.030 align:start position:0%
ems providers are able to conduct
currently

02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
the law limits the division's ability to
 
02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
release the data for research purposes
 
02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:33.910 align:start position:0%
release the data for research purposes
only

02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
this bill expands the ability to share
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
data not only for research purposes but
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
for analysis of the data as well
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
most recently during the copen 19
 
02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:43.830 align:start position:0%
most recently during the copen 19
pandemic

02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
division was working with contracting
 
02:23:46.870 --> 02:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
with a third party vendor that would
 
02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:47.590 align:start position:0%
with a third party vendor that would
allow

02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
allow
 
02:23:50.710 --> 02:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
for real-time data analytics on copa19
 
02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:51.429 align:start position:0%
for real-time data analytics on copa19
calls

02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
calls
 
02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
this functionality would have given the
 
02:23:55.270 --> 02:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
state as well as the local first
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
responders real-time analysis of call
 
02:23:59.830 --> 02:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
volumes coping 19 symptomatic patients
 
02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
and potential coping 19 clusters
 
02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
however this program stalled through the
 
02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
department's inability to share data for
 
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
analytical purposes
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
additionally there are many other
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities to partner with state and
 
02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:12.230 align:start position:0%
opportunities to partner with state and
federal

02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
agencies to enhance our knowledge
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
understanding and response in certain
 
02:24:17.429 --> 02:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
areas of emergency
 
02:24:20.469 --> 02:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
medical services one of these areas is a
 
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
response to opioid crisis
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
which all first responders in the state
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
have been dealing with on a daily basis
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
for many years
 
02:24:28.870 --> 02:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
by sharing and linking ems data with
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
other sources
 
02:24:31.590 --> 02:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
it will better equip the state and local
 
02:24:33.429 --> 02:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
first responding agency to deal with
 
02:24:33.439 --> 02:24:33.910 align:start position:0%
first responding agency to deal with
these

02:24:33.910 --> 02:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
current with these current crisis
 
02:24:39.429 --> 02:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire ems system relies
 
02:24:41.830 --> 02:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
heavily on our own new hampshire data to
 
02:24:44.309 --> 02:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
shape the future of ems within our state
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
the copa 19 pandemic has shown us that
 
02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
emergency medical services within the
 
02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:49.110 align:start position:0%
emergency medical services within the
state

02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:24:50.950 --> 02:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
needs the ability to act quickly to
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
provide the best patient care to
 
02:24:54.070 --> 02:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
residents of the state
 
02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
this bill provides an avenue for the
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
department to explore different
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that will allow for the anal
 
02:25:01.510 --> 02:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
analysis which will then provide the
 
02:25:02.950 --> 02:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
ability to make sound
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
decisions backed by new hampshire data
 
02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:07.110 align:start position:0%
decisions backed by new hampshire data
additionally

02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
when senator carson spoke about this
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
bill at the beginning
 
02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
um during the the hearing i we did speak
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
with senator apprentice
 
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
in regards to the the proposed amendment
 
02:25:19.670 --> 02:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
that the department was offering
 
02:25:21.270 --> 02:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
um i think there might have been slight
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit confusion
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
the original bill was to amend the
 
02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
current law
 
02:25:29.349 --> 02:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
um we did confirm with senator prentiss
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
during that
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
during the meeting that there is no um
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's no amendment coming for this
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
portion um
 
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
in regards to from the department of
 
02:25:40.469 --> 02:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
safety if anybody
 
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
has any questions i'll be more than
 
02:25:44.150 --> 02:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so so is this data
 
02:25:55.590 --> 02:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
when it's shared is it anonymized anyway
 
02:25:57.750 --> 02:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
what what's in the data that's being
 
02:25:57.760 --> 02:25:58.870 align:start position:0%
what what's in the data that's being
shared

02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
shared
 
02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
very very infrequently we will
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
provide patient information for research
 
02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
purposes is for
 
02:26:14.790 --> 02:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
only health related research
 
02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
most everything is all the personal
 
02:26:20.469 --> 02:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
information is redacted and removed so
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
you you would get like uh incident type
 
02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:23.670 align:start position:0%
you you would get like uh incident type
the

02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
the potential location um
 
02:26:30.389 --> 02:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
the system that we're looking at using
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
would only it would aggregate
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
information at the county level
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
so nobody could get anything lower than
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
the county level
 
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
um but it really it depends on what the
 
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
yes so in those cases where you are
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
sharing patient information with the
 
02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
state is rare
 
02:26:50.550 --> 02:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
what are what are the security
 
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
parameters that are around that
 
02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:53.990 align:start position:0%
parameters that are around that
currently

02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh so currently right now we go through
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
if somebody is requesting any patient
 
02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
information it has to go through a
 
02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
privacy committee that's part of the
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
ems trauma ems and trauma coordinating
 
02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:08.790 align:start position:0%
ems trauma ems and trauma coordinating
board

02:27:08.790 --> 02:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
and then it has to be authorized through
 
02:27:13.030 --> 02:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner department of safety
 
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
at that point there's a user agreement
 
02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
that would be established in regards to
 
02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
that only patient information can be
 
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
used for certain information
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
and at the completion of their research
 
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
all data must be destroyed
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
i guess if i could just follow up on
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
that as i read it
 
02:27:40.630 --> 02:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
i don't see any prescription on
 
02:27:45.270 --> 02:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
personal data here in the bill itself
 
02:27:46.710 --> 02:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
you've indicated that you have some
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
practices but
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
um so and i don't have a off there there
 
02:27:53.429 --> 02:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
is a portion of
 
02:27:56.389 --> 02:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
153 that does speak about the privacy

committee that has to be
 
02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:12.160 align:start position:0%

good morning mr chairman and members of
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is margaret huang
 
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
and i am the alternative dispute
 
02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
resolution coordinator for the new
 
02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire judicial branch
 
02:29:31.349 --> 02:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
i'm testifying today in support of part
 
02:29:31.359 --> 02:29:32.230 align:start position:0%
i'm testifying today in support of part
three

02:29:32.230 --> 02:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
which will permit the office of
 
02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
mediation and arbitration to establish
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
a quality assurance program rsa 490
 
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
e-2 authorizes the office to oversee the
 
02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
development of alternative dispute
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
resolution programs
 
02:29:49.190 --> 02:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
integral to this oversight is the
 
02:29:51.270 --> 02:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
ability to monitor and evaluate
 
02:29:54.070 --> 02:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
services provided by the office and
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
neutrals approved by the judicial branch
 
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
to provide alternative dispute
 
02:29:59.270 --> 02:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
resolution services
 
02:30:01.270 --> 02:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
this bill will codify the office's
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
current complaint practice
 
02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
which is when the office receives a
 
02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
complaint from a party
 
02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
who has participated in a
 
02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
court-connected adr program
 
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
the office investigates the complaint by
 
02:30:13.830 --> 02:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
speaking to the other parties and the
 
02:30:13.840 --> 02:30:14.950 align:start position:0%
speaking to the other parties and the
mediator

02:30:14.950 --> 02:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
mediator
 
02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
the bill will provide those who choose
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
to engage with the court connected adr
 
02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
program with notice that the other
 
02:30:21.990 --> 02:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
parties and or
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
the mediator may share mediation related
 
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
information with the office
 
02:30:29.190 --> 02:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of handling a complaint
 
02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
in addition this section gives
 
02:30:33.110 --> 02:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
permission for parties and mediator
 
02:30:35.270 --> 02:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
to discuss quality assurance issues
 
02:30:36.469 --> 02:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
while still maintaining the
 
02:30:36.479 --> 02:30:37.590 align:start position:0%
while still maintaining the
confidentiality

02:30:37.590 --> 02:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise afforded by law rule or order
 
02:30:44.070 --> 02:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and i'm happy to
 
02:30:47.190 --> 02:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for uh as well
 
02:30:53.830 --> 02:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
so yeah representative mclennan so
 
02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
if you could just maybe give me an
 
02:30:56.880 --> 02:30:57.510 align:start position:0%
if you could just maybe give me an
example

02:30:57.510 --> 02:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
of a situation where
 
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
you think that having this quality
 
02:31:04.389 --> 02:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
assurance program
 
02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
what are some of the difficulties that
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
you encounter that
 
02:31:11.670 --> 02:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
would bring forth a need for this
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question um the
 
02:31:15.750 --> 02:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
framework of confidentiality
 
02:31:19.030 --> 02:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
is patchwork across different case types
 
02:31:20.309 --> 02:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
for mediation
 
02:31:23.110 --> 02:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
so having this part allows the office to
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
cite to a law
 
02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
when speaking to parties in the neutral
 
02:31:28.630 --> 02:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
as an allowance
 
02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
for an exception to confidentiality but
 
02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
only for the purposes
 
02:31:35.830 --> 02:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
of quality assurance so for example
 
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
let's say that the office receives an
 
02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
email from a party
 
02:31:41.590 --> 02:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
that says that they don't believe that
 
02:31:42.790 --> 02:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
the neutral
 
02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
was um neutral
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
was neutral in this case um we would
 
02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
reach out to the party and ask them
 
02:31:51.510 --> 02:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
you know what happened during the
 
02:31:53.990 --> 02:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
mediation um at that time we would ask
 
02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
them if they would be willing to waive
 
02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
confidentiality for themselves for the
 
02:32:01.270 --> 02:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
purposes of investigating the complaint
 
02:32:03.510 --> 02:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
um if they say yes then we will proceed
 
02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
with the investigation
 
02:32:08.469 --> 02:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
um sometimes neutrals and other parties
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the case
 
02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
are concerned about confidentiality so
 
02:32:17.590 --> 02:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
they having this part will allow the
 
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
office to cite to
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
a statute that says yes
 
02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
for this very very limited circumstance
 
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
you are able to break confidentiality so
 
02:32:27.990 --> 02:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
investigate um what happened in this
 
02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:33.510 align:start position:0%
investigate um what happened in this
mediation

02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
02:32:36.840 --> 02:32:37.990 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
rice

02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
rice
 
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
sorry um thank you thank you for taking
 
02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:32:44.710 --> 02:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
so um for the mediation and arbitration
 
02:32:44.720 --> 02:32:45.670 align:start position:0%
so um for the mediation and arbitration
is

02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:32:48.150 --> 02:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
what would one of the instances be say
 
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
they were they felt coerced or
 
02:32:57.030 --> 02:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
um that is a possibility it has not come
 
02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:01.110 align:start position:0%
um that is a possibility it has not come
up

02:33:01.110 --> 02:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
um since i've been head of the office
 
02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
um you know sometimes it could be that
 
02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
the mediator suggested something that a
 
02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
party did not
 
02:33:15.270 --> 02:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
like as an option um
 
02:33:16.870 --> 02:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes it could be that there was a
 
02:33:19.830 --> 02:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
problem with technology
 
02:33:21.750 --> 02:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
that the mediator had trouble navigating
 
02:33:23.349 --> 02:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
a platform
 
02:33:25.270 --> 02:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the situations that
 
02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
have come up
 
02:33:30.070 --> 02:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
um since i've been the alternative
 
02:33:31.910 --> 02:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
speed resolution coordinator and the
 
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
measures that we take
 
02:33:36.389 --> 02:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
are commensurate with
 
02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:52.950 --> 02:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
earlier dennis goulet had his hand up i
 
02:33:54.630 --> 02:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
noticed it isn't up anymore i don't know
 
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair members of the
 
02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
my name is dennis goulet i am the
 
02:34:17.670 --> 02:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the department of
 
02:34:19.990 --> 02:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
information technology
 
02:34:23.429 --> 02:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
and i'm here this morning to testify um
 
02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
in favor of part eight
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
that language was requested
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
actually last session and ended up in in
 
02:34:36.870 --> 02:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
on the bus legislation that didn't
 
02:34:38.550 --> 02:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
proceed so we're we're
 
02:34:41.670 --> 02:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
taking another bite at the apple um we
 
02:34:43.590 --> 02:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
we feel this is important for a couple
 
02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:44.070 align:start position:0%
we feel this is important for a couple
reasons

02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
02:34:46.870 --> 02:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
one is that over time we've been working
 
02:34:48.630 --> 02:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
to coordinate better with our political
 
02:34:51.429 --> 02:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
subdivisions on cyber security
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
incidents which seem to be happening you
 
02:34:55.990 --> 02:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
know quite regularly
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
so the first part of this bill talks
 
02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
about um promulgating
 
02:35:03.510 --> 02:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
suggested not required standards for
 
02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions and the reason
 
02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
for that is really to
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
begin to align and get uh folks on the
 
02:35:12.309 --> 02:35:12.319 align:start position:0%
same page with respect to
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
how you would know whether you are your
 
02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
cyber security posture
 
02:35:19.670 --> 02:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
is good or not
 
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
the second part does require that
 
02:35:24.389 --> 02:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions would report
 
02:35:27.030 --> 02:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
a cyber security incident to the new
 
02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire cyber
 
02:35:30.630 --> 02:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
integration center and and the reason
 
02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
for that is twofold
 
02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
one is that we do connect to a lot of
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
these entities
 
02:35:39.990 --> 02:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
either for law enforcement purposes
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
also for our for the clerks
 
02:35:45.830 --> 02:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
to do motor vehicle registration so if
 
02:35:47.110 --> 02:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
for example a
 
02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
ransomware incident is happening at a
 
02:35:50.469 --> 02:35:50.479 align:start position:0%
political subdivision which has happened
 
02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
frequently we would like to know about
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
that as soon as possible so that we can
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
take steps to protect the state network
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
the second piece is that oftentimes
 
02:36:02.710 --> 02:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
these entities don't really know what
 
02:36:03.910 --> 02:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
resources exist
 
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
for them that could assist them
 
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
in the case of a cyber incident and the
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
faster you respond to a cyber incident
 
02:36:12.070 --> 02:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
the better off you are so
 
02:36:13.830 --> 02:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
we may be in position to point them in
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
the right direction once we know what's
 
02:36:18.389 --> 02:36:18.399 align:start position:0%
occurring in that political subdivision
 
02:36:19.830 --> 02:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
we have some examples where we've been
 
02:36:21.670 --> 02:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
able to help communities
 
02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
you know more quickly recover from a
 
02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
cyber incident
 
02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
now um i i we
 
02:36:30.389 --> 02:36:30.399 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald earlier mentioned an
 
02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that had been placed in the
 
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
bill and that's the last sentence
 
02:36:37.590 --> 02:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
that you see there in this section
 
02:36:40.389 --> 02:36:40.399 align:start position:0%
and it was suggested to me that um i
 
02:36:40.399 --> 02:36:42.309 align:start position:0%
and it was suggested to me that um i
inadvertently

02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
inadvertently
 
02:36:45.670 --> 02:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
misused um
 
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
legal um jargon the hold harmless
 
02:36:53.110 --> 02:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
the intent there was that if if a um
 
02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
if a political subdivision based on lack
 
02:36:58.230 --> 02:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
of knowledge didn't report to us
 
02:37:01.110 --> 02:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't penalize them in any way so
 
02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
i have new language that's
 
02:37:04.630 --> 02:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
that's much better that i would like to
 
02:37:06.550 --> 02:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
ask this committee to consider
 
02:37:09.110 --> 02:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
i can send that right along right after
 
02:37:10.790 --> 02:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
this meeting it's essentially the same
 
02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
thing what it says is that if a
 
02:37:12.399 --> 02:37:13.750 align:start position:0%
thing what it says is that if a
community

02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
fails to report there'll be no jeopardy
 
02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
attached there's no
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's no penalty or anything like that
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
so it's a very simple switch out of the
 
02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
last sentence one
 
02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
one for another that's all my formal
 
02:37:28.469 --> 02:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
testimony happy to answer any questions
 
02:37:35.190 --> 02:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:37.030 --> 02:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
and you're going to send that proposed
 
02:37:38.550 --> 02:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to us or
 
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
send it to the committee yes i will
 
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:37:44.830 --> 02:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:47.510 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
today

02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who'd like to
 
02:37:52.950 --> 02:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
testify today on hospital 142.
 
02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
if there are you can raise your hand if
 
02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:08.469 --> 02:38:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
therefore i'll declare the hearing on
 
02:38:13.110 --> 02:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 143
 
02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:20.389 align:start position:0%
house bill 143
quote

02:38:20.389 --> 02:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that concludes our work for the day
 
02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
unless there are any other issues that
 
02:38:30.550 --> 02:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:33.190 --> 02:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
if not i just want to say i really don't
 
02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
like these omnibus bills i
 
02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
felt it was hard to follow and i'm
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
really like concerned that
 
02:38:40.950 --> 02:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
i may have missed an important question
 
02:38:43.429 --> 02:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
somewhere so i just thought i'd
 
02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
voice my disagreement with this
 
02:38:49.270 --> 02:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
i i i think there are many who share
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:54.389 --> 02:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
no i don't uh i don't think it's a good
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:00.389 --> 02:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
okay then i guess we see everybody uh
 
02:39:03.670 --> 02:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
next tuesday morning at nine o'clock
 
02:39:06.150 --> 02:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
and uh if i i do get the proposed
 
02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
amendments and they're sent to me then
 
02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
i'll send up
 
02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
everybody okay
 
02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody have a great week
 
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
