00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
employee um loses what they've earned
 
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
and and they they do earn this they know
 
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:21.879 align:start position:0%
these are these are wages that they
 
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
earned and in many well in many cases uh
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
the employer will will pay them what was
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
left on their ped up the vacations and
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
such uh in other cases it doesn't happen
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
and this is because it's at the up to
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
the employer policy which in some cases
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
I think we would agree uh is abused and
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
I've given you examples of those and uh
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
I hope that you will read and understand
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
them and see that uh we could address
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
this once and for all by putting
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
everyone on the same page and knowing
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
that once once the vacation time is
 
00:08:59.230 --> 00:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
earned it belongs to the employee and
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
and and then should be paid out
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
regardless of the circumstances of the
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh termination of employment whether
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
they uh give notice don't give notice uh
 
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
even if they're let go and we're
 
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
assuming that they were they they were
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
good employees and and earning that uh
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
vacation up until the time they were let
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
go uh again this is uh this has been the
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
law in Massachusetts for over a century
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
and I know we don't do everything they
 
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
do in Massachusetts but I hope we'll do
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
this one uh there's a lot of work uh at
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
the department of labor on this issue
 
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
alone and I believe Mr Ogden will speak
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
to that when he uh takes that witness
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
chair virtual chair any questions I'll
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
them representative kill uh there's a
 
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.240 align:start position:0%
question here in the uh lb
 
00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
representative agent thank you Mr
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank the member for taking
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
the question um just looking over this
 
00:09:59.310 --> 00:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
um this looks like it applies to um as
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
we just discussed in termination um some
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
employers have um endof year policies
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
where vacation time lapses uh and it's
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
almost like if you don't use it you lose
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
it um is this is that applicable in this
 
00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:18.519 align:start position:0%
uh legislation as well or does this just
 
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
revolve around termination thank you
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative for the question uh that
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
was part of the original bill which last
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
year the committee uh moved that was
 
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
uh a good idea but really over really
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to work so this is the use
 
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.240 align:start position:0%
or lose is still happening this is only
 
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
when you leave the company or you're
 
00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:41.639 align:start position:0%
laid off that whatever you have left on
 
00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
okay uh there any questions for resent
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
kill in the committee
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
room see no more folks I have to plug in
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
my computer um has gone out of battery
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
so I have to look across the room
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any hands
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
raised I do have one question for the
 
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
presenter representative kahill is this
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
an All or Nothing bill for you that you
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
would um only accept it if every single
 
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
line one through
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
15 were to be
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
approved uh thank you Mr chairman I I'm
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
interested in you know and edit says
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
they may be needed we did work hard on
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
this with three work sessions last year
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
and that is this is the exact same uh
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
wording um but I'm amenable if if we
 
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
will accomplish the the overarching goal
 
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh in preserving the earnings of the
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
employee I'd certainly be willing to
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
listen I I know there was some concern
 
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
expressed previously about when somebody
 
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
is fired you know for cause but you know
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
cause isn't defined in our rsas and it
 
00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
could be anything you know we're in at
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
will state and uh but if if you have
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
another idea I'd be willing to
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
listen right thank you I have a question
 
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
here in the committee room
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative Hof you recognize for the
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative I have a question on uh
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh number two where it says provides a
 
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
means through which vacation time
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
request and approvals our
 
00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:26.949 align:start position:0%
request and approvals our
process

00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm not really sure that that has
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
much to do with what it is that you're
 
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
you're asking for my understanding is is
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
you just want folks to be able to after
 
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
they've approved uh vacation time if
 
00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
they're uh separate from their
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
employment that they would get um that
 
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
back in in monetary form so I I don't
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
really understand why uh two is there to
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
me that sounds like they're asking for
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
their vacation when they're there and
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's whether or not the company approves
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
it I just don't see how that drain to
 
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
the rest of the
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill so I guess I just is it I'm I'm
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
just where am I reading this wrong uh
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
question well I I think this is actually
 
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
fairly standard practice but people
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
should know you know how they have to go
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
about asking for V for time off there is
 
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
a one of the incidents I I sent you
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
there was a a case where someone asked
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
for the time off and it was repeatedly
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
denied because of you know the needs of
 
00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
the company and then when uh when she
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
left she couldn't get her vacation pay
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
so normally there's a process where you
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
you request it and it's approved and
 
00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:46.519 align:start position:0%
this is sort of not that unusual um
 
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
again I think it's just sort of a common
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
sense thing that most people are
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
probably most employers probably do
 
00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:54.519 align:start position:0%
anyway but it's just letting the people
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
know how it should be done and that
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:01.790 align:start position:0%
there is a
process

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
follow followup um so I just I want to
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
be clear to my understand what I'm
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
seeing here is not the idea that the
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
vacation time has been earned and is
 
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
already the employees to have what I'm
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
seeing is legislation that is
 
00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:25.710 align:start position:0%
seeing is legislation that is
saying

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
that they're having an issue trying to
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
figure out when they're going to take
 
00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
their time if they're still there see
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying yeah that's that's not
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
Sor thank you that's that's not the
 
00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:38.759 align:start position:0%
issue we that's not the primary issue
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
but I think this just uh sort of fits in
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:47.079 align:start position:0%
know how how an employer and employee
 
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:49.240 align:start position:0%
understand you know the granting the
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
request and granting of a vacation and
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
how much they have left you know on
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
their in their in their Bank Etc so I I
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
think this is not really an additional
 
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh an additional issue it's really just
 
00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:04.839 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
same thank you
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
represent any further questions in the
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
L any questions on Zoom well I think I
 
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
saw Mr
 
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
tum Mr tumy represent T you recognize
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
your question thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
this past the last session in the labor
 
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
committee 14-2 and then it passed the
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
house why isn't it law what happened uh
 
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
we had a
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic Mr Tumi and and the Senate
 
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
looked at all the bills they had coming

Rudy Ogden Deputy Commissioner
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor um I just want to
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
speak briefly to this bill uh in echoing
 
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
what uh representative Cahill said this
 
00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
is something that comes up quite often
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Labor uh for
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
purposes of context in New Hampshire
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
there are no Baseline benefits law
 
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
essentially there is no law or
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
requirement that employers provide
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
vacation time or annual time or sick
 
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
time or things of that nature
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
accordingly in statute specifically RSA
 
00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.309 align:start position:0%
accordingly in statute specifically RSA
275

00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
275
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
435 uh there is language that says that
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
these things uh become wages when do in
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
application that has meant that the
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
employer has the ability through policy
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
or practice to Define uh when these are
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
due and owing uh that is the type of
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
language that allows an employer to set
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
certain conditions or certain parameters
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
that have to be met in order for the
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
employee to enjoy the benefits just in
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
terms of volume because I know some of
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
you do like um to deal with data and
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
deal with numbers uh typically the
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor we handle about 250
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
to 300 wage claims a year wage claims
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
are not us doing an inspection or
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
investigation and then bringing an
 
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
employer uh to a hearing wage claims are
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
when an employee calls the department or
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
files a claim with the Department saying
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
that they are owed something uh of the
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
250 to 300 wage claims that are actually
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
brought forward each year and brought to
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
hearing anywhere from 20 to 30% of those
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
might have a component of paid time off
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
in play um I just would note that
 
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
hearings oftentimes have multiple issues
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
so the employee might be complaining
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
about lost vacation time and some other
 
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
issue but again for purposes of
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
transparency about 20 to 30% of the
 
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
claims involve uh pay time off or
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
vacation time and I would just note in
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
speaking with employees on this matter
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh some of them I believe when they get
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
the policy they either don't read the
 
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
policy or when they get the policy they
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
don't agree with the policy uh so it's
 
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
just something that even though we try
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
to educate those folks on what the law
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
is uh they are pretty insistent on
 
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
bringing the claims forward because
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
again they feel as though the time is
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
there and should be paid uh so I'm happy
 
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions but again just
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
for purposes of context this is
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
something that comes up and I do think
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
when it comes up it's worth remembering
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
that there's no requirement that uh
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
annual or vacation time be provided it
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
really is the employer through policy uh
 
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
programs do I have any questions here in
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
the L for representative aen uh Vice
 
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh seaworth thank you Mr Mr
 
00:19:30.909 --> 00:19:30.919 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Deputy
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioner for providing your data um
 
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
my question is has in are you aware of
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
the department ever
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
encountering um a company who has
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
essentially an uncapped vacation
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
policy UNCA in terms of no limit on the
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
acrs right um I will be honest in saying
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not Direct directly aware of an
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
employer who has an uncapped acral
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
system they might be out there I'm just
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
saying I've not directly dealt with an
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
employer with no
 
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
cap follow up
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
and likewise I I'm not aware of a New
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employer personally that does
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
that I have seen it in other states and
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
so my question is I'm kind of wondering
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
how the department would deal with such
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
an employer and the idea of PR rating
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
vacation time when essentially it's
 
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
unlimited uh thank you for the question
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth in terms of our
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
what we believe the application of this
 
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
pration language would be is if the idea
 
00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
is is that it's not AC crude and it's
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
instead given out in tranches such as
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
every year you get two weeks our
 
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559 align:start position:0%
understanding would be is that the
 
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
person's time in the position we would
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
say Okay they've been in the position a
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
year they get two weeks they've been in
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
in the position six months they get one
 
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
week they've been in the position four
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
years they get uh two years they get up
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
to four weeks so that's our
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the proci language
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
here is um meaning again I don't mean to
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
speak for representative Cahill but
 
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
that's our understanding of the intent
 
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
that he has put forward relative to
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
pration just that absent in a cruel
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
system you'd be using pration to say
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions here in the
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
Zoom don't see any hands uh Mr Ogden I
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
have a question will infantine um this
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
is this piece of legislation
 
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
specifically talks about vacation
 
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
time what how will this
 
00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:00.279 align:start position:0%
affect companies that don't technically
 
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
have a vacation time they have X amount
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
of hours that can be used for anything
 
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
vacation sick personal time they you
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
know they give them 15 days for all of
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
these things some employers do
 
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
that you does that need to be delineated
 
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
here uh chairman infantine I think the
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that is
 
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
something representative kahill
 
00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
reference the fact that there were
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
multiple SE uh work sessions last year
 
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
on this bill and that is something that
 
00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
was discussed I would say that for our
 
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
purposes where it says vacation time we
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
again in RSA 275
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
435 when we're talking about these types
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
of benefits we do say vacation time
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
personal time sick time if there's just
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
a universal bucket that has at times
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
come up as an issue if you're not able
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
to attribute it outward so for your
 
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
question when we look at vacation time
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
under this bill we would be looking look
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
at something where it's cataloged as
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
vacation time so if it's not cataloged
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
as vacation time to your point that's
 
00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
something potentially Worth delimitating

Vice President of the associated general
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
contractors of New Hampshire um I'm here
 
00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to the bill um kind
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
of a little bit of a repeat of a bill
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
you had earlier uh we are in support of
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
companies devel veloping their own
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
office policies to address these issues
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh whether it be vacation sick time
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
personal time uh this bill starts to
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
Cloud the issue of regulations by the
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
state uh many employers have different
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
regulations regarding vacation time uh
 
00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
some employers give vacation time but
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
have in their policies they can't use it
 
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
for a period of time um this seems to be
 
00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
in conflict with that there are many
 
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
cases where um some of these things are
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
grouped together um I think we're kind
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
of heading into trying to draft uh State
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
policy for office policies that are
 
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
developed by companies so overall as I
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
listen to uh the Department of Labor I'm
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
not so sure that justifies the the
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
number of cases I don't see those number
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
of cases as a
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
reason that this is a huge problem uh it
 
00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
seems like there's a problem that the
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
employee does doesn't understand the
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
office policies uh that are given to
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
them office policies cover lots of
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
issues including retirement and other
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
items so uh we're here today to uh leave
 
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
it with up to the company to develop
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
policies and with that I would hope that
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
you would uh report this bill uh House
 
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 113 uh in expedient to legislate
 
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
and be happy to answer any
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
questions I have any questions for the
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
Zoom uh I see representative Broody has
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
his hand up representative Broody you're
 
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
speak thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:47.559 align:start position:0%
um Mr adbert um when especially
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
contractors sometimes contractors have
 
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
to work more than five days a week and
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
they work a lot of overtime and maybe
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
some of these contractors pay by the
 
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
days work or hours work is how they acrw
 
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
their vacation time and if you're
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
opposing the bill are you opposing that
 
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
when the person leaves the employee that
 
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
um there could be a reason why the
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
employer doesn't want to pay vacation
 
00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
time I I I think what I am saying is uh
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
first of all most the construction
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
employers have vacation sick time
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits and all the rest um
 
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm relaying to you is in
 
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
the construction industry it's much more
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
complicated based on season based on uh
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
the extra hours their policies can be a
 
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
lot more complicated than a simple uh
 
00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:44.039 align:start position:0%
regular 9-to-5 business and we really
 
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
want to preserve that those companies
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
have their options in developing their
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
own company policies around what type of
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
work they do so I I I hear what you're
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
saying and I will tell you most of the
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
construction companies have clear and
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
set policies we even have as an
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
association an HR committee uh with all
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
the HR professionals uh I represent
 
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
large commercial uh they understand that
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
in a dispute the issue goes to the labor
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
department and there's an interpretation
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
of the company's office policies we
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
think that's the right way to go that's
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
what we've done for many many years and
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
we' like to continue
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
that I hope that answered your
 
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.510 align:start position:0%
that I hope that answered your
question

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:35.799 align:start position:0%
uh I'll take that for right now but I
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to follow up yeah I'm
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap my arms around why when
 
00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
somebody leaves an employ that they
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
don't get their full vacation time
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
that's coming to them and I think that's
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
what this bill is trying to do I I think
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
to answer that is really a major concern
 
00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:57.559 align:start position:0%
is lines 13 through 13 and 14 um for any
 
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
any reason uh there may be appropriate
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
reasons to have an office policy that
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
vacation time is not given I know in
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
previous hearings I've heard of other
 
00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
companies that had those policies where
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh if you leave me high and dry on a uh
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
something that has to get done or have
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
to cover the thing it may be outlined in
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
the policy that you don't get your
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
benefits and you have to understand that
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
policy and that's to protect what the
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
Company's trying to do so that specific
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
one is very very specific and there may
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
be instances in which companies uh that
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
that kind of flies in the face of uh
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
policy I see a a question hand from
 
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
representative Smith you're um
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
question did Mr Bui uh did
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bui finish his question
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead okay thank you hello Mr
 
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
Abit good to see you again or or to hear
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
you anyway um if you'll Check Line
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
number five you'll see that the policy
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
that the company has is important
 
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
whether it applies to you will get
 
00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
vacation you won't vac get vacation it
 
00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
the policy is written and so um lines
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
number uh 12 through 13 uh really
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
reflect the fact that the policy drives
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
this um does that make
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
sense uh I I think I understand what
 
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
you're saying but I think the whole
 
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
intent here is starting to develop State
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
statutes to put in place company
 
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
policies and I think overall as a bigger
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
picture uh we're not sure that's a great
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
idea uh in the sense that companies are
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
different you have any followup restive
 
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
SMI are you all
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you I don't see any
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
other hands on Zoom or any other
 
00:29:58.509 --> 00:29:58.519 align:start position:0%
questions here
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
lob Mr abber this is will infantine I
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
have a question for you um you mentioned
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
in your te well first off I think you
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
heard my question of Mr kahill Senator
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
representative kahill whether or not he
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
would accept All or nothing on this uh
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
every line of this piece of
 
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
legislation and my
 
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
question has to do with that to you as
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
well um you mentioned in your testimony
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
four times you want to preserve what is
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
written by the company manual or what
 
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
they have you don't want legislation
 
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
interfering in that being said wouldn't
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
line five and part of line six inform
 
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
employees in writing of any policy
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
regarding ACR or use of vacation time
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
and any limit or acud or use wouldn't
 
00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:44.919 align:start position:0%
that be I mean that's the basis of this
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
entire your entire argument what would
 
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
be the harm with having that sentence as
 
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
a piece of legislation yeah I'm in
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
agreement with you and maybe that was
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid's question as well
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm not opposed to reinforcing
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
that the company policy is what uh
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
drives it uh my focus has been as long
 
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
as that is uh retaining the current
 
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
situation I don't have an issue with it
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
but I think ex getting into these other
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
things where the company policy May
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
deviate from what's required that's my
 
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
point thank you I have a question um
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
another question for you here in the L
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
be Vice chairman seaworth thank you Mr
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um and I kind of want to follow
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
up on uh the Chairman's question because
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
I was on this committee last year I
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
remember some of the discussions there
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
was some confusion with people I talked
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
to and I'm not sure we were ever on the
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
same page so I'll ask you as you read
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
this legislation if there is a conflict
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
between a company policy is written and
 
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
the requirements of line 13 through
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
15 which would take precedence would it
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
be the company policy or do is this bill
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
written so that state law would override
 
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
any non-compliant company
 
00:32:19.389 --> 00:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
policy I think that would be an
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate question for the Department
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
of Labor I I would hope that that line
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
13 would be removed from this
 
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.310 align:start position:0%
13 would be removed from this
legislation

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
up no thank you you thank you Mr Vice
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
chair all right any other uh I see
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
representative Bui has his hand up
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative buy you're recognized for
 
00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.669 align:start position:0%
representative buy you're recognized for
a

00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
Ben there you go understand me better
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
when you can't hear me
 
00:32:57.789 --> 00:32:57.799 align:start position:0%
maybe um 13 and 14 no
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
if if I got fired today for whatever
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
reason I'd have to get paid to by
 
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
tomorrow what would be the difference in
 
00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:08.519 align:start position:0%
that if if I get fired it's probably an
 
00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:10.070 align:start position:0%
that if if I get fired it's probably an
unpleasant

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
unpleasant
 
00:33:13.149 --> 00:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
termination and my pay has to be there
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
the next day why wouldn't my pay plus my
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
built up vacation time be there the next
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
day and I I do believe
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
that if there's written policy such as
 
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
what you stated that if you walk off the
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
job before the jobs finish and it harms
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
the company that that's in company
 
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
policy and if I sign an agreement that
 
00:33:35.629 --> 00:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
says that I agree to that so I I don't
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
think that this would override it and I
 
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
don't think the the state law would
 
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
override a personal
 
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
contract it's up to the department to uh
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
let's just assume that let's just assume
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
that U your company has a policy that
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
says You must give a two- week notice if
 
00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to leave in order to to get
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
your vacation time this bill would make
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
company it would mandate it would
 
00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:11.079 align:start position:0%
override it and say that you're owed it
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
circumstances followup followup thank
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
you yes sometimes especially in a
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
construction business um you could be
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
done with a job and not even know it
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
within two weeks like once the job is
 
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
finished you're off the job and you move
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
on to the next one but I think that
 
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
anytime something is earned they should
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
get it when they're when they leave I
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
think that's the bottom line thank
 
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
you would you believe thank you would
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
you believe that I I believe that
 
00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:49.149 align:start position:0%
you believe that I I believe that
represent

00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%

line
 
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
five are you aware of any of the
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
companies that you
 
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
represent who offer vacation days that
 
00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
do not inform their employees of their
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
vacation policy no I'm I I believe all
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
the companies inform their employees and
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
give out office policies uh when they
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
start employment at the company and then
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
they also receive it whenever there's a
 
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
company update I I believe I'm I'm in
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
strong belief that all the companies do
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
that thank

committee I trust you can hear me okay
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
yes for the record my name is Dave J I'm
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
a senior vice president at the business
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
and industry
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
Association uh we serve as the state of
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Statewide Chamber of
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
Commerce I'm here in opposition to this
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
bill um many of uh bia's reasons for
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
opposing the bill were articulated very
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
well by Gary Abbott I would like to
 
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
emphasize based on uh Deputy
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Ogden's uh reporting of the
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
numbers uh relating to this type of
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
situation it strikes me as being a very
 
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
low number and he acknowledged that uh
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
even those numbers which I consider to
 
00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
be low many of those are because either
 
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
the employee misunderstood the employer
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
policy or just didn't agree with it so I
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
think we're trying to uh
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
correct um a problem that does not
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
happen very often and the way we are
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
choosing to do it is to again have the
 
00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:12.839 align:start position:0%
state decide for employers what their
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
employee benefits should be and as I've
 
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
testified on other similar bills we
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
believe that employers are in the best
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
position to develop a benefits policy
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
that allows them to attract and retain
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
the employees that they uh want and need
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
for their Enterprises just a couple of
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
specific other issues um it was alluded
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
to earlier but I want to emphasize that
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
many employers across New Hampshire are
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
moving away from vacation time and
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
moving away from sick time and calling
 
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
it instead personal time that could be
 
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
used either when the individual is not
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
feeling well or when they want to use a
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
vacation so this bill I'm not sure how
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
that would treat personal time it's not
 
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the language of the bill
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
and I also wanted to respond to a
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
question that I think representative
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
seaworth asked um because he's correct
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
there are some companies and this
 
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
happens uh a lot in the tech sector that
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
are doing away with vacation in sick
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
time benefits completely and just
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
allowing the employee to um take the
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
time that they want for vacation and
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
sick time with the understanding that
 
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
you know they're still responsible for
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
for uh job responsibilities over the
 
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
long term so for those companies it
 
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
would be very confusing how to implement
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
this bill where it to become law so once
 
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
again the Bia is opposed and I'd be
 
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
happy to address any questions from the
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
juv I don't see any questions here oh I
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
do see one representative turot you
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
recognize for a question thank you Mr
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr duvet for taking
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
the question uh were you online when I
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
asked Mr AB question question about are
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
you aware of any companies you represent
 
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
that offer the vacation but do not
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
inform their employees uh I pose the
 
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
same question to you yeah thank you
 
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
represent turkot well the Bia has uh 400
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
Plus members they are companies of all
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
sizes from the state's largest employers
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
down to single owner operators um I
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
think our companies uh tend to be
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
relatively sophisticated employers and I
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
S I've never
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
survey them but I suspect most if not
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
all have some form of of employee uh
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
manual I know here at the Bia and we're
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
a small employer we have an employee
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
manual and on the very first day of
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
employment uh not only is the manual
 
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
distributed but it is gone over uh by by
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
the HR professional to make sure that
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
the employee is aware of of uh it has
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to ask questions about
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
specific um uh benefits associated with
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
employment I don't know for for all of
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
the you know 30 or 40,000 companies here
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire how many have employee
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
manuals but I would suggest that if they
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
don't they should because obviously that
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
helps um alleviate any confusion over
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
what benefits they offer and what
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
benefits they do not
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
offer thank you for your answer I didn't
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
mean you put you on the hook for the
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
companies any other additional questions
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%

represent Consolidated Communications I
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
will be very brief we fully understand
 
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
and appreciate that employees should get
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
vacation time that they deserve
 
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
Consolidated currently provides for all
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
of the conditions that are set out in
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
this bill however we oppose hb13 because
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
we do not think that voluntary benefits
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
provided by an employer should be
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
regulated uh similar to what Mr Abbott
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
and what Mr ju have said we ask that the
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
committee find HB 1113 inexpedient to
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you for your
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
consideration and I'm happy to answer
 
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.870 align:start position:0%
consideration and I'm happy to answer
any

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for the
 
00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
presenter see none in the
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
lob seeing no hands on
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
Zoom oh yes I do sorry I apologize for
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
that representative Tumi you recognized
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this policy only
 
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
applies to employers that set up a
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
policy where vacation is acred like once
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
a month or once every two months or or
 
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
or some kind of a policy and what it
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
seems to me that this uh legislation
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
deals with employers that do that
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
employers that have other policies
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
saying for example you don't get a
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
vacation unless you work the full 12
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
months in their policy manual it seems
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
to me this would not apply to that this
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
seems to me only to apply to employers
 
00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
that set a policy that vacation time is
 
00:42:47.549 --> 00:42:47.559 align:start position:0%
acred uh in a certain way and once they
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
set that policy it's up to the to the
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
law to hold them to the policy that they
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
set uh am I right or am I
 
00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
wrong thank you for the question
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative if I understand correctly
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
you're you're asking if a company has
 
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
established a policy say in a manual
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
such as Mr juv was was um citing that uh
 
00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
their policy supersedes anything else is
 
00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:25.069 align:start position:0%
their policy supersedes anything else is
that

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
correct not sure I understand well you
 
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:32.839 align:start position:0%
you would this bill says that employ uh
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
that any they inform employees in
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
writing of any policy regarding their
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
vacation time and limits on it um each
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
situation is different with Employers in
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as the Deputy Commissioner
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
do said uh these things are not
 
00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:55.559 align:start position:0%
regulated by the state it is employee
 
00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
specific because vacation time and sick
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
time and personal time are all
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
voluntary and so I can speak for
 
00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
Consolidated we have a very specific
 
00:44:10.829 --> 00:44:10.839 align:start position:0%
manual as Mr juv said about the Bia that
 
00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
goes through each and every detail and
 
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
an employee must sign that when they
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
commence employment and if anything
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
changes during their employment uh their
 
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
re these policies are reviewed and so I
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
I again think that this would try to
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
regulate something that is individual to
 
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
a company and should not be regulated at
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
a state
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
level can I answer that question Mr
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
chairman have a followup yes okay well
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that if you set policy
 
00:44:53.069 --> 00:44:53.079 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to set the policy
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
that vacation acru once a month or once
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
every two weeks or
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
whatever if you don't want to live up to
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
that policy don't set it but once you
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
set it and the employee reads it and
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
signs the the policy manual it seems to
 
00:45:14.589 --> 00:45:14.599 align:start position:0%
me that you have to live up to it and if
 
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
you don't live up to it somebody has to
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
step in and say you're required to live
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
up to it because you made that agreement
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
just like any other contract so uh
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
that's my point Thank you for for your
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
question though and for your testimony
 
00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:30.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
Tumi um thank you uh oh
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
session we have a question from our vice
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr chairman see worth
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
your recognize a representative the
 
00:45:49.549 --> 00:45:49.559 align:start position:0%
previous representative's um question if
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
you will confus me a little bit I
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
thought I heard this explained earlier
 
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
but I'll ask you um you said your your
 
00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
company has a policy that addresses the
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
issues that are within this bill um if I
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
were an employee of your company and I
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
felt that you had violated the policy
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
that you have written and that you've
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
given to
 
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
me am I correct in understanding that I
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
could take that to the Department of
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
Labor and they would adjudicate it and
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
enforce your policy if in fact you were
 
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:31.640 align:start position:0%
not following
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
it thank you thank you for your question
 
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
representative I am not certain of the

opine I did and apologies I I don't mean
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%

speaking so um I'm happy to answer any
 
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
questions in terms of the last question
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes under present law if there was a
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
a policy that was not being followed uh
 
00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
that is what would be enforced so uh we
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
have had instances in which an employer
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
has a policy um the employer does not
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
follow the policy the claim is pro
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
brought forward uh and then we would
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
make an order for payment uh relative to
 
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
the UN the lost time or the time that
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
should have been uh to the benefit of
 
00:47:59.470 --> 00:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
the employee uh one other question that
 
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
was asked a couple times are there
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
employers who do not give out policies
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes that does happen I would uh agree
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
with Mr juve's point that a lot of
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
sophisticated employers do provide these
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
policies uh but we certainly come into
 
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
contact with employers that do not
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
provide these policies uh to their
 
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
employees thank
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%

Bill uh oh thank you very much yes um
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
I've left all the details to everybody
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
else and I'm going to speak to the
 
00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
forest rather than the trees from the
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
first moment that representative kahill
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh talked to me about this bill I I was
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
100% in favor of it in my mind it is a
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
matter of fairness it is a matter of
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
living up to a contracts and I am was
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
very proud that this committee and that
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
the house passed this bill in
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
recognition of of that basic premise and
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
I think when our workers are in such
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
trouble in terms of their incomes with
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
covid uh it is a a vote of confidence
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
that we give to them that we think that
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
they should get at least what is due to
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
them um ethically um so I the the
 
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:29.079 align:start position:0%
details I think have been well worked
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
out last year through the three work
 
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
sessions and I'm just going to appeal to
 
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
your basic sense of fairness here thank
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%

representative kahill do we have anyone
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
else in the
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
queue uh I I don't see any hands uh I do
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
see other people attendees but no no one
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
has raised a hand they're just listening
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
we are just uh such an interesting
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
committee they all want to listen in all
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
right seeing no additional people in the
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
queue uh I have no additional
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
individuals who have signed up uh either
 
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
to testify or as a position so I'll be
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
closing the hearing on House Bill 113
 
00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
have approximately eight minutes before
 
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
we have a very very difficult bill just
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
kidding on House Bill
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
8589 um I have 12 people in support and
 
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
no one wants to talk so it looks like
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to have just a sponsor
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully present this piece of
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
legislation I would like a few few
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
comments while we have a few minutes
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
here before everyone goes and takes a
 
00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
quick break about our executive session
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
this afternoon um I don't know if
 
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
everyone's had the opportunity to read
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
the rules about executive session and
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
how we'd like to proceed first of all we
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous amount of um
 
00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:04.839 align:start position:0%
amendments on some bills which I believe
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
are going to be pretty unanimous about
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
how we are going to pass these um but I
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
need to make sure I have all these
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
because I have multiple ones Heather are
 
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
us by any
 
00:52:19.789 --> 00:52:19.799 align:start position:0%
chance I'm used to the old fashioned way
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
you bring me down a nice yellow or red
 
00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
folder you know and you bring it down to
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%

00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
red tab on it and we have all these
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
things um I have been sending all of you
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
every amendment that I have received so
 
00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
um we're going to have to it might be a
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
little slow this afternoon we start off
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure everyone has the right
 
00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
amendments and for those any new members
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
on the lefthand corner um on the
 
00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
amendment like this one I'm looking at
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
from representative seaworth is 2021
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
d2008 so we'll know that's how you know
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
which amendment um we're we're we're
 
00:53:00.789 --> 00:53:00.799 align:start position:0%
talking about representative uh Sullivan
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
raised yes uh
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
it lots of Amendments have been coming
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
in uh they've been coming in during a
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
time period when we we've been getting
 
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
flooded with emails um and if we read
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
the um email with the attached Amendment
 
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
at a time when we couldn't print it um
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
we may have lost track of it um if
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
someone Heather perhaps um could uh uh
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
give us a list of the Amendments that we
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
need to to locate um we can probably I I
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
can probably find them but um uh it
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise we may find ourselves starting
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
on an exec session and and some of us
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't have the the necessary amendments
 
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799 align:start position:0%
what I will try to do representative
 
00:53:47.069 --> 00:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
Sullivan is uh I think our next hearing
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
is going to take about 10 minutes I'm
 
00:53:51.069 --> 00:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
going to study all my amendments here

questions all right so there's been some
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
acrimony um going back and forth I guess
 
00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:38.839 align:start position:0%
someone told me there was a court
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
session recently on zoom and where the
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
person was not the person who was
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
actually the defendant or something and
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
um so now everyone's worried about who's
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
voting are they actually the right
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
person voting is people voting in favor
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
of you and some of the pictures here
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh there's no pictures there's just a

didn't see
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
that I the only reason I know is I
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
missed it last week and I was
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
wondering how people were counting
 
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
numers so fast but it was up there
 
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
before they put it in color but they
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
don't leave they don't give us
 
00:58:14.349 --> 00:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
anymore that's fine whatever it does
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
make it easier because before we had to
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
hunt and find the speaking and that was
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%

Responders who have had critical
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
exposure this is House Bill 589
 
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
dfn uh we've talked about this for
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
several years now those of you who have
 
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
been Veterans of the committee will
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
remember this uh there was an issue with
 
01:04:16.029 --> 01:04:16.039 align:start position:0%
a with language that was
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
inserted last time with
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh information that the the saliva if
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
someone spits in your face Cas you have
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
to determine that there's sufficient
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
that there's if there's blood in
 
01:04:32.029 --> 01:04:32.039 align:start position:0%
sufficient magnitude that would cause
 
01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
illness now this is quite a test if
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
you're if they spit in your eye I don't
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
know how you're going to see it and uh
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
and of course the first thing you're
 
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
going to do is wipe it off and what is
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
sufficient magnitude it's not really
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
defined it's not practical so we're
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
striking that language and we're just
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
going to leave it up to the medical
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
professional who that you that you
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
should see following such an exposure uh
 
01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
we've had two incidents right here in
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
New Market where uh um an ENT was uh
 
01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
bringing a someone down the stairs after
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
a drug overdose after giving him Naran
 
01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
and the person spit into his eye that
 
01:05:10.109 --> 01:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
person saw treatment and the bill was
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
not paid by workers comp uh absorbed by
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
our town uh a few years later policeman
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
responded to a domestic abuse case uh
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
known drug user and he's spit into the
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
open mouths the officers during a
 
01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:31.230 align:start position:0%
open mouths the officers during a
struggle

01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
so you may you may recall that uh we had
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
uh a lobbyist uh working for the uh
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
workers comp provider who you know had
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
contested this initially and then said
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
that you know he was done with it we
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
were fine and that he wasn't going to go
 
01:05:49.549 --> 01:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
further with it that we had done what we
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
should be doing and these are few cases
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
few cases are few and far between but I
 
01:05:58.029 --> 01:05:58.039 align:start position:0%
think any Cas is is too many um last
 
01:05:59.950 --> 01:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
year I gave you a letter from my police
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
chief citing his concern that you know
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
new New Market has paid for these
 
01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
treatments and that other smaller towns
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
may you know the uh first responded may
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
be nervous about causing an extra
 
01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
expense for the town and you know
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
pressures being what they are not get
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
the treatment they need not be given not
 
01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
have the Baseline test or given the
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
treatment that may prevent the disease
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
from taking root so I hope that this
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
year once again we will pass it get it
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
over to the other body who will take it
 
01:06:33.269 --> 01:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
to the next step and I can stop talking
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
to you about this issue thank you very
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
much Mr
 
01:06:39.309 --> 01:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.269 --> 01:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
L questions online we
 
01:06:53.269 --> 01:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
do I see one see one here I couldn't see
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
onl thank you Mr chairman representative
 
01:07:04.829 --> 01:07:04.839 align:start position:0%
um am I to understand this is uh to
 
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
definition um thank you for the question
 
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
what what the bill does is it says that
 
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
uh if you have exposure to uh ruptured
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
skin or or mucous membranes including
 
01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:24.839 align:start position:0%
the eyes or mouth with
 
01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
um blood or body fluids including saliva
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
you should be able you should get
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
treatment that should be determined by
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:40.349 align:start position:0%
 
provider

01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.359 --> 01:07:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
I G take a just a quick quick Liberty
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
here representative K if you don't mind
 
01:07:51.309 --> 01:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
legislation if you look at RSA 28 8182
 
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
IE um it does Define critical exposure
 
01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:02.839 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's what that this part
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
is amending but yeah I will accept your
 
01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up question because the followup
 
01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
um do you consider the the part of of
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
your bill where it says um in uh one- e
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
um testing and treatment shall be
 
01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
determined by a medical provider taking
 
01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
into account the physical examination
 
01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:27.640 align:start position:0%
and incident details provided by the
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
patient you consider that a
 
01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.149 align:start position:0%
patient you consider that a
definition

01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
um well yeah the the critical Expos the
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
the definition is the U the person who
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
has suffered the exposure would uh seek
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
treatment and explain to the provider
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
what has uh transpired
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
and that the uh the uh provider would
 
01:08:59.950 --> 01:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
then evaluate that information and exam
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
and do an exam and determine these steps
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
that would be taken to prevent injury or
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.149 align:start position:0%
 
illness

01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
illness
 
01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
Point uh any other questions in the L
 
01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.669 align:start position:0%
Point uh any other questions in the L
[Music]

01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
online uh uh this is Will infantine
 
01:09:32.189 --> 01:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
representative I have two questions for
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
you number one did this bill just die
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
because of covid and Omnibus that is
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
correct my second question is I
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
understand would you believe I
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
understand what representative Huff is
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
saying and that you might want to talk
 
01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
about this while I'm 100% support of
 
01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
this bill we may want to take that one
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
sentence out and put it under another
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
maybe C1 or something like that because
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
you are confusing a definition with a an
 
01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
action would you believe uh I certainly
 
01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
would Mr chairman and um it's it's a
 
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
minor change but a major major
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
impact any other questions for
 
01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.270 align:start position:0%
impact any other questions for
representative

01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
kahill I see no hands online I see no

kahill I currently
 
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
have seven individuals in support zero
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
oppose one neutral no one else wants to
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
testify representative kahill or do we
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
have anyone in the queue with a hand up
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
that would like to testify I see no
 
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
hands pardon me uh representative um Mr
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
Ogen from the uh Department of Labor uh
 
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
did sign up a little bit y you did tell
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
me that my apologies for not putting it
 
01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
to memory yes representative Ogden's
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
going to be busy this morning he wants
 
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
to talk about all great representative
 
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
Ogden you
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative okay Ogden you are
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
recognized I appreciate the promotion uh
 
01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.630 align:start position:0%
recognized I appreciate the promotion uh
chairman

01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
and for the record uh Rudy Ogden Deputy
 
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Department of Labor um just
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of offering thoughts on this I
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
think it's important to recognize and I
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
I think representative Huff's question
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh teases this out uh the operative
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
effect of this adjustment is these
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
definitional terms of critical exposure
 
01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
and prophylactic or post-exposure
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
prophylaxis these are defined terms
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
under existing law specifically critical
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
exposure which is being amended is then
 
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
called out in the definition of
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
postexposure prophylactics the important
 
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
of those terms the importance of those
 
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
terms being called out is that under RSA
 
01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.430 align:start position:0%
terms being called out is that under RSA
281

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
281
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
a23 6 and 6A there is reference to the
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
fact about what should happen when there
 
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
has been a critical exposure or when
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
prophylaxis treatment has been called
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
for and terms of the discussion that
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
just happened about perhaps that one
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
portion of the uh adjustment being
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
pulled out of the definitional section
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
um I would offer the option of again an
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
RSA 281
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
A236 and six paragraph six and paragraph
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
6A that's actually where the compulsion
 
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
is called for that for Force responders
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
expenses associated with post uh
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
postexposure prophylactics are to be
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
paid for so again that would be one area
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
where if you want to put in that
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
language associated with who determines
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
what evaluation and testing should be
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
done it might be better situated or
 
01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
might sit better there uh so again I
 
01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
just think in considering this uh this
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
bill you should be looking at RSA 281
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
a23 paragraph 6 and paragraph 6A that's
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
actually again the operative effect of
 
01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
what you're doing with these definitions
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
so I think representative kahill
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
described what the fix or what the
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
intent is here but I would recommend
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the language in that statute
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
that I've cited uh and again I would
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
also offer that that might be an option
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
for where to put that second part of the
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
the proposed
 
01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
Bill uh commissioner aan I'm looking at
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
a23 right now you said paragraph five
 
01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
and six A2 five so paragraph five and
 
01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
six are where in statute is talking
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
about the provision of care relative to
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
critical exposure
 
01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
I think chiefly we're talking about 6A
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
here which says that all expenses
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
associated with the medical evaluation
 
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
and recommended postexposure prophylaxis
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
treatment for emergency response SLU
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
safety workers shall be paid by the
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
employer's insurance carrier or third
 
01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.590 align:start position:0%
employer's insurance carrier or third
party

01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
administrator um and then it goes on to
 
01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
say such medical evaluation uh shall be
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
provided without prejudice to the issue
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
so I just point out there that that's
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
the section which says that when a first
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
responder or safety worker has been ex
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
had a critical exposure that the
 
01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier or self-insured entity
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
is to provide uh for the costs and and
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
again I think that this might be the
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
section where you could say when we're
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
talking about costs or we're talking
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
about protocols and preventative
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
measures those should be uh done by the
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
person making uh the initial uh looking
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
incident Mr chairman
 
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
representative kale you have a question
 
01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
for mren or do you want to speak again
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
or well I'm thinking that the the reason
 
01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
that this was put here was because of
 
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
the other language that that said that
 
01:14:38.629 --> 01:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
the uh the must be visible blood in
 
01:14:38.639 --> 01:14:39.709 align:start position:0%
the uh the must be visible blood in
sufficient

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
magnitude and that's kind of what I was
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
trying to address why it was placed
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
there uh I want to make sure that that
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
that isn't that part is uh removed so
 
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.270 align:start position:0%
that isn't that part is uh removed so
that

01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh I think I think we're only talking
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
about the term the words testing and
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
treatment shall be determined by the
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
medical provider is that what you
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
understand that we're
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
discussing uh okay well you said your
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
definition of critical exposure which
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
I'm it is my is my belief that critical
 
01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.629 align:start position:0%
I'm it is my is my belief that critical
exposure

01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
definition through the words person's
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
bodily or blood or bodily fluids should
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
be under RSA a21 e where it is correct
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
currently and that the the sentence
 
01:15:29.709 --> 01:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
testing and treatment shall be
 
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
determined by the medical
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
provider um and incidental details
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
provided by the patient should go under
 
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
A236 as Mr Ogden has outlined I you know
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to do the best I can here
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
trying to read it as I'm going here um
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
but it does talk about the expenses
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
associated with it and that would
 
01:15:54.629 --> 01:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
probably be the place to to add that is
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
your am I do I understand you correct
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner Ogden uh correct apologies
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
if I wasn't clear what I was speaking to
 
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
is exactly what you've just described
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
namely where representative Huff had
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
pointed out that second sentence perhaps
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
not fitting neatly within a definitional
 
01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
section okay we're good thank you yeah
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
if you have an opportunity to go on to
 
01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
um 281 a20 three five and six there and
 
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
take a look at that it might
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
be I don't know I'm just lucky I can I'm
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
reading it right here so I can see it
 
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh commissioner Ogden any
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
other questions for
 
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
either representative kahill or
 
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner Ogden in the
 
01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
L I see none
 
01:16:49.149 --> 01:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
online I also see
 
01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
none representative kahill we have
 
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:55.400 align:start position:0%
anyone in the queue I see no one no
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
hands okay unless I see anything further
 
01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
as I said we have seven support zero
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
oppos one neutral no one want wishing to
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
testify that being said I'm going to
 
01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on House Bill
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
589 and if you wouldn't mind folks
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
taking a break until quarter of 11
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
before we have our next hearing and then
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully I will have determined all of
 
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
the correct amendments and dealt with uh
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
Christina and try to get those emailed
 
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:27.800 align:start position:0%

remainder of these amendments to make
 
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:13.560 align:start position:0%

01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:47:17.790 --> 01:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
procedure uh representative Sullivan has
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
your caucus told you anything about
 
01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
you know you know the oldfashioned way
 
01:47:25.149 --> 01:47:25.159 align:start position:0%
we have the we have the
 
01:47:27.629 --> 01:47:27.639 align:start position:0%
folders and we have to sign off on these
 
01:47:29.310 --> 01:47:29.320 align:start position:0%
things and we have to do the blurbs and
 
01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
we have to um you know make sure we have
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
the red taged
 
01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
amendments um you know the fact that we
 
01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
can't walk over to
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
L and back and forth did they give you
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
any direction because I'm still waiting
 
01:47:44.189 --> 01:47:44.199 align:start position:0%
for additional
 
01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
Direction not really um the I I know
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
last uh last session um
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
they uh I believe took the red tags off
 
01:47:55.390 --> 01:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
of the Amendments so I I believe that
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
piece is gone um the um because I and
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
and I because it was before my time I
 
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
don't really even recall how that worked
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
but I think it it was simplified last
 
01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
year for the amending process um so I
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think we need to have an
 
01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
official copy of an amendment um they're
 
01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:14.669 align:start position:0%
official copy of an amendment um they're
all

01:48:14.669 --> 01:48:14.679 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
um it's okay to print them right off the
 
01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:20.719 align:start position:0%
computer Heather did uh before she had
 
01:48:23.709 --> 01:48:23.719 align:start position:0%
to go uh to get more Inc uh did put
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
together all of the updated amendments
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
she has so as um I'll be just going
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%

01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%

02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
representative Brian seaworth who for
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
this hearing will not be Vice chairman
 
02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:00:05.310 --> 02:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chairman I'll
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
virtually step away from the committee
 
02:00:12.430 --> 02:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
table here so I can introduce House Bill
 
02:00:15.149 --> 02:00:15.159 align:start position:0%
261 for the record my name is
 
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative Brian seaworth I
 
02:00:20.109 --> 02:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
represent Penbrook and
 
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
shester um this is another bill the
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
third and final you'll be happy to hear
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
bill that I submitted um that kind of
 
02:00:34.030 --> 02:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
came through the study committee that I
 
02:00:39.790 --> 02:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
talked about to sessions ago um this is
 
02:00:42.510 --> 02:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
language that came to us from the
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor as a as a requested
 
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
update um like the last one I presented
 
02:00:56.189 --> 02:00:56.199 align:start position:0%
this particular RSA was outside the
 
02:00:58.589 --> 02:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
scope of that study committee so the
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
study committee took no action and made
 
02:01:05.470 --> 02:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
no opinion on it um however we had uh
 
02:01:08.109 --> 02:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
this language and so when we came to a
 
02:01:10.589 --> 02:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
new session this year I
 
02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
submitted um the request exactly as the
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor had written it uh I
 
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
turned it into OS and it is now now HB
 
02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
261 um compared to the other two bills
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
that I've presented to the committee
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
this is obviously uh has a bit more to
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
it um it's a bit more
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
complicated and I am probably not the
 
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
one to go through the details with you
 
02:01:44.350 --> 02:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
so what I am going to do is ask Deputy
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioner commissioner Ogden to
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
explain the det details of this bill and
 
02:01:53.790 --> 02:01:53.800 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that committee members
 
02:01:56.830 --> 02:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
reserve the tough questions for him
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
because he will be able to answer it um
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
but the point of this bill like the
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
other two is it's intended to be a
 
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill and the intention is
 
02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
the federal labor law on the uh
 
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
surrounding the issue of apprenticeship
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
has changed and the department would
 
02:02:24.189 --> 02:02:24.199 align:start position:0%
like to get our state labor law aligned
 
02:02:28.069 --> 02:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
with that and this bill is should be
 
02:02:32.430 --> 02:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
doing no more and no less than that so
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you to
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
the committee any questions for
 
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
lobb any questions online on
 
02:02:47.189 --> 02:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
Zoom seeing none the chairman has a
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
question representative I received a
 
02:02:53.149 --> 02:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
relatively tur email last night on this
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
bill uh saying how you were ruining
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
everything and doing everything terrible
 
02:02:58.830 --> 02:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
and this looks like just some word
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
smithing um on updates was
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
that is there your opinion that possibly
 
02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
have you seen that email number
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chairman yes I believe
 
02:03:13.510 --> 02:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
I saw that email and I'll ask for a
 
02:03:17.069 --> 02:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
followup I give myself a followup and um
 
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
you think it was just misunderstood
 
02:03:25.950 --> 02:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I do believe
 
02:03:29.470 --> 02:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
that it was a misunderstanding certainly
 
02:03:32.069 --> 02:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
it misunderstands my
 
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
intent I did not put any I didn't have I
 
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
took the input directly from the
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and turned that over
 
02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:41.069 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and turned that over
to

02:03:41.069 --> 02:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
OS um this is not a request for any
 
02:03:49.069 --> 02:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
policy changes I certainly had no input
 
02:03:52.030 --> 02:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
in in terms of policy that I tried to
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
get in here uh as far as the
 
02:04:00.270 --> 02:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
details you know the consequences of the
 
02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
language changes are probably a little
 
02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:04.069 align:start position:0%
language changes are probably a little
bit

02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
over what I'm capable of answering so I
 
02:04:10.510 --> 02:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
certainly encourage any members who have
 
02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
concerns about the
 
02:04:15.310 --> 02:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
language um to ask the Department of
 
02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
Labor to clarify things all right I'm
 
02:04:18.990 --> 02:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
just going to cut right to it if that's
 
02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
okay because um there's concerns that Mr
 
02:04:27.790 --> 02:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
Ogden can um Can clarify but just for
 
02:04:29.629 --> 02:04:29.639 align:start position:0%
any other questions here in the
 
02:04:32.589 --> 02:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
lb I'm seeing none any questions
 
02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
online seeing none commissioner Ogden
 
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:38.440 align:start position:0%

02:04:46.549 --> 02:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
indicated the this bill is something
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
that the department actually did come
 
02:04:50.669 --> 02:04:50.679 align:start position:0%

02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
marifield who had been in discussions
 
02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
with uh Lauren Smith from the federal uh
 
02:04:58.910 --> 02:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
us office of apprenticeship this is
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
something that had been talked about
 
02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
between the Federal Department of Labor
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire Department of
 
02:05:07.229 --> 02:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
Labor a as an item that we should seek
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
to clean up in terms of specifics or
 
02:05:12.430 --> 02:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
what the intent is here uh really the
 
02:05:14.750 --> 02:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
Genesis of this goes all the way back to
 
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
2007 in in 2007 RSA 2 78 was amended the
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
intent of those amendments were to
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
clarify and make clear that registered
 
02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship in the state of New
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be federally uh
 
02:05:33.069 --> 02:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
regulated and federally overseen and
 
02:05:36.430 --> 02:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
what I mean by that is if an employer or
 
02:05:38.589 --> 02:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
if a trade group or if anything of that
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
nature is looking to get a registered
 
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program uh if they're
 
02:05:47.189 --> 02:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
looking to seek uh Federal approve if
 
02:05:48.669 --> 02:05:48.679 align:start position:0%
they're looking to seek Department of
 
02:05:50.310 --> 02:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
labor approval if they're looking to
 
02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
receive grants if they're looking to
 
02:05:55.629 --> 02:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
receive uh things of that nature that is
 
02:05:58.189 --> 02:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
all done and funnel through the OA or
 
02:06:00.030 --> 02:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
the office of apprenticeship at the
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
federal level uh what is in place
 
02:06:05.310 --> 02:06:05.320 align:start position:0%
presently is essentially an
 
02:06:08.069 --> 02:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship advisory Council that is
 
02:06:09.790 --> 02:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
the council that you if you look at the
 
02:06:13.069 --> 02:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
language of RSA 278 it's talking about a
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
council it's talking about what the
 
02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
council should be doing or is supposed
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
to be doing
 
02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
and what I will say is since 2007 and
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
certainly since I've been in the with
 
02:06:26.669 --> 02:06:26.679 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor since
 
02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
2013 uh the the council has not really
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
been acting in accord with statute
 
02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
specifically where it talks in RSA
 
02:06:38.510 --> 02:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
278 about the council approving or
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
setting standards all of that has been
 
02:06:44.549 --> 02:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
happening through the federal usdol
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
office of apprenticeship so that's
 
02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
really the Crux of what we're trying to
 
02:06:49.149 --> 02:06:49.159 align:start position:0%
do here
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh I believe there is a lot of confusion
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
around this uh area I've spoken to two
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
individuals from Trad unions this week
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
and after speaking with them I don't
 
02:07:01.069 --> 02:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
mean to speak for them and maybe they'll
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
be speaking today but they seem to
 
02:07:05.709 --> 02:07:05.719 align:start position:0%
understand what was happening and had no
 
02:07:08.069 --> 02:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
concerns I will say I spoke with one
 
02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
gentleman who said something similar to
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
I believe that tur email which is
 
02:07:14.629 --> 02:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
essentially you know these are all
 
02:07:16.390 --> 02:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
registered programs and you're going to
 
02:07:18.830 --> 02:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
get rid of all these programs that's not
 
02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to do what we're
 
02:07:23.229 --> 02:07:23.239 align:start position:0%
looking to have happen is just have a
 
02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
statute which better reflects the
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
reality which is that this registration
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
these approvals and the standard setting
 
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
does not happen at this Council it
 
02:07:34.910 --> 02:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
happens at the office of apprenticeship
 
02:07:38.270 --> 02:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
and again I would go back to 2007 in
 
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
2007 the US Department of Labor when
 
02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
they saw what was happening with RSA 278
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
they essentially made the request of us
 
02:07:49.350 --> 02:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
to serve as an advisory Council they did
 
02:07:52.270 --> 02:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
not want this Council uh setting
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
standards because again they believe
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
that registration approval and standard
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
setting resides with them the only other
 
02:08:02.430 --> 02:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
thing I would point out is if folks have
 
02:08:05.229 --> 02:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
concerns with what this statute uh what
 
02:08:07.910 --> 02:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
the statutory amendment is seeking to do
 
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
it is something that should be talked
 
02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:11.719 align:start position:0%
about because again this council is not
 
02:08:13.549 --> 02:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
doing certain of the things where you
 
02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
see strikeouts in this bill specifically
 
02:08:19.069 --> 02:08:19.079 align:start position:0%
around if you look in paragraph three
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
where we talk about striking out
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
supervision of the execution of
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
agreement and mainten of Standards if
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
you talk about paragraph five this
 
02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
Council issuing certificates uh that's
 
02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:33.400 align:start position:0%
stuff that this council is not doing um
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
so lest anyone say that we are changing
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
anything in practice this will change
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
nothing it will just be that the council
 
02:08:43.069 --> 02:08:43.079 align:start position:0%
will now truly sit as an advisory
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
Council which is our understanding was
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
the intent going back to 2007 um again
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
we believe in apprenticeship we believe
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
in the fact that there are a number of
 
02:08:54.629 --> 02:08:54.639 align:start position:0%
individuals who have made wonderful
 
02:08:56.910 --> 02:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
careers by through for themselves going
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
through apprenticeship and it's a
 
02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful powerful tool that helps a lot
 
02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
of people and does a lot of good this is
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
not in any way seeking to undermine that
 
02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
again what's happening now is all of
 
02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
this is happening through the office of
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship through the USD and we
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
just want to make clear that that is the
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
track in which to pursue registered
 
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship again I'm not trying to
 
02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
speak for the usdol but I can
 
02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:23.599 align:start position:0%
comfortably say that they have had some
 
02:09:26.149 --> 02:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
concerns that with the existing law it
 
02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
appears is that there are these two
 
02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
tracks to registered apprenticeship one
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
through this Council one through the
 
02:09:34.950 --> 02:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
office of apprenticeship and we just
 
02:09:37.310 --> 02:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that there is one track
 
02:09:38.430 --> 02:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
and it's through the office of
 
02:09:40.750 --> 02:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship with the usdol not
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
through this apprenticeship advisory
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you
 
02:09:51.709 --> 02:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner Ogden I have any questions
 
02:09:53.629 --> 02:09:53.639 align:start position:0%
of any of the committee members online
 
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan and then
 
02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:58.830 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan and then
representative

02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%

to the entire committee did it and if so
 
02:10:24.109 --> 02:10:24.119 align:start position:0%

and I believe that was the one don't
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
think I saw it
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%

or form that um he was an appropriate
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
all right I did we all got it it came to
 
02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
the entire committee 312 on Tuesday
 
02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Warden I have a
 
02:12:14.830 --> 02:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
I have a question from representative
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
bushard followed by Bui and Tumi
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative bushard
 
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:12:26.709 --> 02:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh assistant uh Deputy Commissioner um I
 
02:12:30.189 --> 02:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
also got that email and I was concerned
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
to see if you can reinforce that this
 
02:12:36.189 --> 02:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
bill will ensure that workers are well
 
02:12:41.310 --> 02:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
trained as well as performing their work
 
02:12:44.270 --> 02:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
safely uh thank you representative buard
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
again I would just the those standards
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
that are set set forth relative to
 
02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
training and those standards that are
 
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
set forth relative to safety for these
 
02:12:56.549 --> 02:12:56.559 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship programs those are all
 
02:12:58.709 --> 02:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
put forth and promulgated by the office
 
02:13:01.390 --> 02:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
of apprenticeship uh so again I do not
 
02:13:04.270 --> 02:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
see this statutory change as in any way
 
02:13:06.109 --> 02:13:06.119 align:start position:0%
impacting the training or safety
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
afforded to individuals seeking out
 
02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships again I think what we're
 
02:13:12.510 --> 02:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do is clarify the fact that
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
this Council which meets I believe on a
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis this Council does not
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
discuss those things and this Council
 
02:13:22.990 --> 02:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
does not promulgate those things uh this
 
02:13:25.750 --> 02:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
Council literally the times I've been
 
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
there uh they they talk about
 
02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities they talk about events
 
02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
they talk about uh opportunities to seek
 
02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
out new uh venues for apprenticeship
 
02:13:38.589 --> 02:13:38.599 align:start position:0%
programs but this Council in and of
 
02:13:41.549 --> 02:13:41.559 align:start position:0%
itself does not discuss or Define what
 
02:13:43.549 --> 02:13:43.559 align:start position:0%
should be done in terms of training or
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
safety for apprenticeship programs that
 
02:13:46.510 --> 02:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
all sits with the office of
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:50.719 --> 02:13:51.589 align:start position:0%

you know I haven't really had a chance
 
02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
to to take a look at this but I was
 
02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about this this
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh because I'm concerned whether
 
02:16:35.230 --> 02:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
this takes away some of the unions
 
02:16:38.669 --> 02:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
involvement and Power in in terms of
 
02:16:40.870 --> 02:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship programs and turns it
 
02:16:45.549 --> 02:16:45.559 align:start position:0%
over to the solely to management without
 
02:16:48.589 --> 02:16:48.599 align:start position:0%
uh any kind of uh
 
02:16:51.549 --> 02:16:51.559 align:start position:0%
guarantee that the that the unions have
 
02:16:51.559 --> 02:16:52.830 align:start position:0%
guarantee that the that the unions have
equal

02:16:52.830 --> 02:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
equal
 
02:16:56.070 --> 02:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
access uh to uh the apprenticeship
 
02:16:58.190 --> 02:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
programs and and the design of the
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship programs and the you
 
02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
know and the design of the apprentiship
 
02:17:08.509 --> 02:17:08.519 align:start position:0%
programs could Miss Smith help me with
 
02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
this sure let me give you just a short
 
02:17:15.629 --> 02:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
history in up until 2007 the state of
 
02:17:18.669 --> 02:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire assumed the role of all of
 
02:17:20.110 --> 02:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for all
 
02:17:23.230 --> 02:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships in New Hampshire in
 
02:17:25.709 --> 02:17:25.719 align:start position:0%
2007 um they handed it back to the
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
federal government um and I don't know
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
the exact reason for that however I do
 
02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
have documentation saying that they no
 
02:17:35.309 --> 02:17:35.319 align:start position:0%
longer wanted the responsibility of the
 
02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
registrations the reviews that type of
 
02:17:42.070 --> 02:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
thing so um in 2007 the role of the
 
02:17:46.669 --> 02:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
committee became more um to advise us
 
02:17:48.070 --> 02:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
about things that were going on in the
 
02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
state and how we could respond best to
 
02:17:54.750 --> 02:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
meet the needs State um so what has
 
02:17:57.950 --> 02:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
happened is the committee has um assumed
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
that role we have assumed all the roles
 
02:18:03.150 --> 02:18:03.160 align:start position:0%
of the registration of
 
02:18:06.509 --> 02:18:06.519 align:start position:0%
programs um and we have two in our
 
02:18:08.910 --> 02:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
office who continue to register programs
 
02:18:10.509 --> 02:18:10.519 align:start position:0%
we continue to have grants in New
 
02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now we are dealing with
 
02:18:15.950 --> 02:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
seven grants um that are actually
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
operated by
 
02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
um entities some are private some are
 
02:18:24.750 --> 02:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
public um and all this really this Bill
 
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
is saying is that we want to clarify the
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
language for people who are trying to
 
02:18:31.950 --> 02:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
explore apprenticeship that the council
 
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
is not where they go first um they would
 
02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:37.519 align:start position:0%
come to our office first because we are
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
the ones who can do it in the past
 
02:18:41.910 --> 02:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
people had to wait a month or so for the
 
02:18:43.870 --> 02:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
meeting of the council in order to be
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
approved for apprenticeship we can
 
02:18:47.629 --> 02:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
approve apprenticeship in a day if we
 
02:18:50.910 --> 02:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
need to so as far as your question with
 
02:18:53.230 --> 02:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
regard to unions nothing has changed
 
02:18:56.469 --> 02:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
since 2007 it remains exactly the same
 
02:18:59.469 --> 02:18:59.479 align:start position:0%
unions are a very high priority for us
 
02:19:01.549 --> 02:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
um as the office of apprenticeship
 
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
because obviously that is where
 
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship began it is the
 
02:19:07.389 --> 02:19:07.399 align:start position:0%
foundation of apprenticeship programs we
 
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
are expanding into other um areas
 
02:19:12.549 --> 02:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
besides construction such as Healthcare
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
it um
 
02:19:17.549 --> 02:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
manufacturing energy others like that
 
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
but as far as the unions nothing has
 
02:19:21.669 --> 02:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
changed everything will be exactly the
 
02:19:24.509 --> 02:19:24.519 align:start position:0%
same as it always has been so the safety
 
02:19:27.070 --> 02:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
is the primary responsibility of the
 
02:19:30.110 --> 02:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Labor um and that is the US
 
02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Labor our office reports
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
directly to the Secretary of Labor in
 
02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:36.469 align:start position:0%
directly to the Secretary of Labor in
Washington

02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
Washington
 
02:19:39.629 --> 02:19:39.639 align:start position:0%
DC so I hope I've answered your question
 
02:19:40.990 --> 02:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
and given you a little bit of the
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
context that's helpful in understanding
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
what's happening
 
02:19:47.950 --> 02:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
here thank you uh for your answer
 
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
I am a a little disappointed
 
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
that I had no idea this was coming up
 
02:19:55.389 --> 02:19:55.399 align:start position:0%
today because I would have liked to done
 
02:19:57.950 --> 02:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
some research on it my daughter is the
 
02:19:59.870 --> 02:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Labor in Oregon and told
 
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
me to watch out for bills dealing with
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships because of the fact that
 
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
in a number of states uh unions are are
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
being cut out o of the equation and I
 
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
would hope that would not happen here in
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:20:22.910 --> 02:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
so I can't I'm not knowledgeable enough
 
02:20:25.590 --> 02:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
with about this bill to be able to say
 
02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
good bad or indifferent so anyway thank
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Tumi I'd be happy to
 
02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
talk to you about that because I know
 
02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
where that line of thinking is coming
 
02:20:36.870 --> 02:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
from um so I would be able to talk to
 
02:20:40.150 --> 02:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
you offline about that but just to give
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
you a hint of what that's about is
 
02:20:45.150 --> 02:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship has now adopted in
 
02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
addition to the registered
 
02:20:48.469 --> 02:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
there is another um type of
 
02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship that is run by industry
 
02:20:55.950 --> 02:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
specifically it is called industry
 
02:20:59.150 --> 02:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
recognized apprenticeship programs and
 
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
many unions feel um because they are not
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
part of that type of apprenticeship that
 
02:21:08.070 --> 02:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
they are being left out so that's sort
 
02:21:10.110 --> 02:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
of in a nutshell but it is sort of a
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
long political discussion about this
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
additional type of apprenticeship it was
 
02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and yeah I would like to
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:29.630 --> 02:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
y representative Tumi I'm sorry it was
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
in the calendar I'm sorry you missed it
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%

02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:39.280 align:start position:0%

02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
meeting next next week not next no I
 
02:21:50.910 --> 02:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
apologize we will not be meeting again
 
02:21:54.750 --> 02:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
after today until probably Thursday the
 
02:21:57.190 --> 02:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
4th of March we were not meeting next
 
02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
week we are not meeting the week of the
 
02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
house session which is supposed to be
 
02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
the 23rd or 24th and 25th of February so
 
02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
we'll be probably meeting after that we
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:22:12.910 --> 02:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
um probably have another hearing on uh
 
02:22:15.190 --> 02:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
the representative kahill's amendment to
 
02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
one of his bills because it's so
 
02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
different um that I think it it should
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
have um and uh then we will have an
 
02:22:26.110 --> 02:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
executive session then so there's you
 
02:22:28.030 --> 02:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
know a good two or three weeks for
 
02:22:29.950 --> 02:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
anyone who has any concerns about this
 
02:22:31.990 --> 02:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
to bring them to my attention or to your

fellow caucus members um and
 
02:22:38.469 --> 02:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
um hopefully to be to be worked out to
 
02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:40.680 align:start position:0%

02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps we should do ours at 11:45 as
 
02:28:55.230 --> 02:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
well so that uh if anybody wants to jump
 
02:28:57.750 --> 02:28:57.760 align:start position:0%

recognized to speak on your motion um I
 
04:07:55.550 --> 04:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
believe this bill is um unnecessary
 
04:07:57.030 --> 04:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment that was
 
04:07:58.469 --> 04:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
presented to
 
04:08:01.269 --> 04:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
um uh fix it but I think the amendment
 
04:08:02.910 --> 04:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
really doesn't accomplished much and it
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
really maybe made it even less clear as
 
04:08:10.109 --> 04:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:11.550 --> 04:08:11.560 align:start position:0%

any other
 
04:08:33.389 --> 04:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
comments the chair will say that it was
 
04:08:35.309 --> 04:08:35.319 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention that the bill
 
04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
may have been more harmed the way it has
 
04:08:39.349 --> 04:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
been amended because it says I think Ben
 
04:08:40.830 --> 04:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
representative berui brought this to my
 
04:08:43.349 --> 04:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
attention it says between zero and three
 
04:08:45.030 --> 04:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
uniforms which could mean
 
04:08:48.349 --> 04:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
zero um and uh based the situation we're
 
04:08:52.030 --> 04:08:52.040 align:start position:0%

thoughts uh this is the bill that is
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
housekeeping in nature and it clarifies
 
04:12:49.269 --> 04:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
that the members of the workers
 
04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
compensation appeals board can be paid
 
04:12:55.109 --> 04:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
either per DM which is currently allowed
 
04:12:58.670 --> 04:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
in law or hourly uh which is currently
 
04:13:00.070 --> 04:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
done by
 
04:13:04.510 --> 04:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
practice um at the suggestions brought
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
up during the public hearing uh the
 
04:13:12.269 --> 04:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
amendment was added that the per Dums
 
04:13:15.149 --> 04:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
are pro-rated on an hourly basis using
 
04:13:18.830 --> 04:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
7.5 hours per day which once again is
 
04:13:21.349 --> 04:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
the current practice so it doesn't
 
04:13:23.830 --> 04:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
change anything it just makes it very
 
04:13:27.950 --> 04:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
clear in the law what we're doing um if
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
you recall from the public hearing this
 
04:13:34.030 --> 04:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
is a request made by the Department of
 
04:13:38.349 --> 04:13:38.359 align:start position:0%
Labor which in turn is a response to the
 
04:13:42.990 --> 04:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
LBA audit which said that it would uh be
 
04:13:45.870 --> 04:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
better from a control standpoint if
 
04:13:49.030 --> 04:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
their practice were clearly specified in
 
04:13:53.670 --> 04:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
law the last change that makes today's
 
04:13:56.349 --> 04:13:56.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment different from the one um that
 
04:13:59.109 --> 04:13:59.119 align:start position:0%
I sent around a week ago is
 
04:14:02.349 --> 04:14:02.359 align:start position:0%
representative barudi and I had some
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
discussions uh based on his
 
04:14:08.750 --> 04:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
conversations members of the appeals
 
04:14:13.070 --> 04:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
board and the language as proposed was a
 
04:14:16.389 --> 04:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
little unclear um we had talked about
 
04:14:20.030 --> 04:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
hearings being per DM but there are
 
04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
other things that might be done per dium
 
04:14:27.510 --> 04:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
such as training such as meetings with
 
04:14:27.520 --> 04:14:28.349 align:start position:0%
such as training such as meetings with
the

04:14:28.349 --> 04:14:28.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:14:32.109 --> 04:14:32.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner and after discussion all
 
04:14:37.469 --> 04:14:37.479 align:start position:0%
around uh we agreed and the department
 
04:14:40.990 --> 04:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
also supported this that changing that
 
04:14:43.349 --> 04:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
leaving the language as it is saying the
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
work of the board uh shall be
 
04:14:50.269 --> 04:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
reimbursed was the best way to specify
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
and make sure we didn't mess with
 
04:14:51.840 --> 04:14:54.030 align:start position:0%
and make sure we didn't mess with
current

04:14:54.030 --> 04:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:14:56.710 --> 04:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
practice thank you representative
 
04:14:59.870 --> 04:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
seaworth have any other comments
 
04:15:01.510 --> 04:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative buuy you
 
04:15:04.630 --> 04:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
recognize thank you Mr chairman um I
 
04:15:07.670 --> 04:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
think that the language um this
 
04:15:11.109 --> 04:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
amendment covers what the LBA wanted to
 
04:15:15.109 --> 04:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
do um specify the seven and a half hours
 
04:15:16.990 --> 04:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
that gives a more
 
04:15:20.229 --> 04:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
clearer Distinction on what the rate
 
04:15:24.229 --> 04:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
will be and for how long at their rate
 
04:15:26.229 --> 04:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
this is two different rates is a 400 and
 
04:15:29.670 --> 04:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
a 250 but the S and a half hours uh
 
04:15:31.149 --> 04:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
makes it clear and I think that's what
 
04:15:35.710 --> 04:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
the LBA wanted and um just want to thank
 
04:15:37.750 --> 04:15:37.760 align:start position:0%

04:15:40.229 --> 04:15:40.239 align:start position:0%

04:20:41.279 --> 04:20:43.870 align:start position:0%
 
189h

04:20:43.870 --> 04:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
189h
 
04:20:46.590 --> 04:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
um everyone has
 
04:20:51.229 --> 04:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
that uh if you recall from my testimony
 
04:20:55.910 --> 04:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
this is another housekeeping bill it
 
04:20:58.429 --> 04:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
takes existing
 
04:20:58.439 --> 04:21:00.349 align:start position:0%
takes existing
language

04:21:00.349 --> 04:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:21:04.109 --> 04:21:04.119 align:start position:0%
um in the RSA that is
 
04:21:07.349 --> 04:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
confusing and it separates it clearly
 
04:21:10.269 --> 04:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
into two cases one that applies to
 
04:21:12.030 --> 04:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County
 
04:21:15.149 --> 04:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
workers and then another distinct piece
 
04:21:18.590 --> 04:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
of language that applies to ski
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
andboard instructional
 
04:21:25.710 --> 04:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
employees um the amendment then in the
 
04:21:29.389 --> 04:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
original draft that word instructional
 
04:21:32.510 --> 04:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
was left out which could have been
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
construed to change the intent of the
 
04:21:38.550 --> 04:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
existing RS say and that's not what
 
04:21:41.710 --> 04:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
anybody wanted um so the
 
04:21:46.309 --> 04:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
amendment simply reinserts that term
 
04:21:50.510 --> 04:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
instructional uh exactly as it is in the
 
04:21:54.910 --> 04:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:56.830 --> 04:21:56.840 align:start position:0%

we do we have no that's all right I just
 
04:22:15.109 --> 04:22:15.119 align:start position:0%

right here um representative kahill
 
04:22:20.229 --> 04:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
you're recognized thank you Mr chairman
 
04:22:23.149 --> 04:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
and uh I just wanted to make sure that
 
04:22:24.990 --> 04:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
this is a housekeeping Bill and I'm I'm
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
glad that you put the word instructional
 
04:22:29.750 --> 04:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
in there so that we don't go downhill
 
04:22:34.149 --> 04:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:36.349 --> 04:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
passes good point I I'd like to speak
 
04:22:38.309 --> 04:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
speak if I if I could for some of you
 
04:22:40.590 --> 04:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
new new people people like Mr kahill and
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
representative kahill and some of us
 
04:22:44.109 --> 04:22:44.119 align:start position:0%
guys who' been in this committee for 10
 
04:22:47.070 --> 04:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
years um I remember when this came to
 
04:22:49.149 --> 04:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
fruition as as many of you know or if
 
04:22:51.830 --> 04:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
you haven't uh if you are an employee
 
04:22:53.830 --> 04:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
and you are called into work you and
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
there is no work for you to do you must
 
04:22:57.229 --> 04:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
be paid for at least a minimum of two
 
04:23:00.389 --> 04:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
hours work and uh a few years ago I
 
04:23:01.790 --> 04:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
don't know six eight years ago it was
 
04:23:03.189 --> 04:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
decided that a lot of these people that
 
04:23:05.670 --> 04:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
work at the ski areas that teach uh
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
skiing or snowboarding um would rather
 
04:23:10.830 --> 04:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
instead of having pay they would rather
 
04:23:12.469 --> 04:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
go out and ski that's what they like to
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
do um so it allows them to do this there
 
04:23:17.229 --> 04:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
was some concern that you know we we
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
going to start doing this with everybody
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
that there's no work at the restaurant
 
04:23:21.750 --> 04:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
so you can have a free meal and going to
 
04:23:23.229 --> 04:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
do this and how it's going to go and it
 
04:23:25.149 --> 04:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
really hasn't metastasized into anything
 
04:23:26.710 --> 04:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
like that that I can see over the last
 
04:23:28.950 --> 04:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
number of years uh this is a very unique
 
04:23:30.790 --> 04:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
situation and and although we don't like
 
04:23:32.510 --> 04:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
to carve a lot of things out as you know
 
04:23:33.750 --> 04:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of carve outs in our
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
workers compensation laws for real
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
estate agents and and a few other things
 
04:23:40.510 --> 04:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
so would it makes sense uh to do these
 
04:23:44.870 --> 04:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
things um and as representative kahill
 
04:23:47.590 --> 04:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
Appley um pointed out making it
 
04:23:49.870 --> 04:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
specifically just for who it's supposed
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:23:53.790 --> 04:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
for um in this does clean it up because
 
04:23:55.630 --> 04:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
we do not want someone coming into work
 
04:23:57.510 --> 04:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
and saying well here you're supposed to
 
04:23:59.910 --> 04:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
do X today but go skiing and and and
 
04:24:01.189 --> 04:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
we're not going to pay you for those two
 
04:24:04.429 --> 04:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
hours and we all agree that I think we
 
04:24:06.269 --> 04:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
all agree very that that's in
 
04:24:09.309 --> 04:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate and U so uh any other
 
04:24:11.990 --> 04:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
comments from any members in the lob
 
04:24:14.070 --> 04:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative turkot you have a you'd
 
04:24:16.030 --> 04:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
like to speak I would thank you Mr
 
04:24:17.910 --> 04:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
chairman uh for the record I am in
 
04:24:20.710 --> 04:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
 
04:24:24.030 --> 04:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
um but also going on the record I I am
 
04:24:27.229 --> 04:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
generally opposed to specific car vs
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
such as this but since this is a
 
04:24:34.189 --> 04:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
clarification more than a uh a new carve
 
04:24:36.750 --> 04:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
out I I will support it as as has
 
04:24:39.429 --> 04:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
written thank you Mr chairman welcome

Andor one of them a New Hampshire
 
04:30:02.269 --> 04:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association uh spokesperson
 
04:30:03.630 --> 04:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
who was also a
 
04:30:08.070 --> 04:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:11.229 --> 04:30:11.239 align:start position:0%
labor and their their
 
04:30:14.229 --> 04:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
entire effort appeared to
 
04:30:14.239 --> 04:30:15.870 align:start position:0%
entire effort appeared to
be

04:30:15.870 --> 04:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:30:18.950 --> 04:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
um wondering why a 30-day period was
 
04:30:21.990 --> 04:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
needed in between the TA and the
 
04:30:23.910 --> 04:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement again
 
04:30:25.389 --> 04:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
this is for
 
04:30:27.670 --> 04:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
transparency it allows the taxpayers
 
04:30:29.269 --> 04:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
should they choose to actually look at
 
04:30:31.229 --> 04:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
it before it signed and allows the union
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
members to look at it before it is
 
04:30:34.640 --> 04:30:36.349 align:start position:0%
members to look at it before it is
signed

04:30:36.349 --> 04:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
signed
 
04:30:39.830 --> 04:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
um some of the other things that they
 
04:30:42.269 --> 04:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
talked about which kind
 
04:30:44.950 --> 04:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
of appeared to me to be nothing more
 
04:30:49.990 --> 04:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
than trying to throw the issue out for
 
04:30:52.149 --> 04:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
or or kind of do a slight of hand really
 
04:30:55.870 --> 04:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
was they talked about not knowing what a
 
04:30:58.710 --> 04:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
tenative agreement was quite honestly
 
04:31:01.389 --> 04:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
anybody who's a union head or somebody
 
04:31:04.149 --> 04:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
in the municipal Association they don't
 
04:31:06.590 --> 04:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
know what a tenative agreement is
 
04:31:10.030 --> 04:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:12.189 --> 04:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
position they also brought up the fact
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
that it was going to delay things by 30
 
04:31:16.590 --> 04:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
days um I made that abundantly clear
 
04:31:18.910 --> 04:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
several times that if you know you have
 
04:31:20.870 --> 04:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
a 30-day waiting period you filled that
 
04:31:22.870 --> 04:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
into your negotiating process you start
 
04:31:25.550 --> 04:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
early or you just remember that you have
 
04:31:25.560 --> 04:31:26.189 align:start position:0%
early or you just remember that you have
that

04:31:26.189 --> 04:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:29.389 --> 04:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
30-day waiting period they also brought
 
04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
up the fact that uh there would be
 
04:31:34.510 --> 04:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
confusion people reading it well to me
 
04:31:36.910 --> 04:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
anybody who goes into look at that is
 
04:31:38.750 --> 04:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to be smart enough to understand
 
04:31:41.349 --> 04:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
what's actually in there the final thing
 
04:31:43.830 --> 04:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
that uh they kept saying over and over
 
04:31:45.229 --> 04:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
well everybody gets to see the
 
04:31:47.189 --> 04:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
collective bargain bargaining agreement
 
04:31:49.510 --> 04:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's posted on the New Hampshire Public
 
04:31:52.830 --> 04:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
employer Labor Relations Board well yeah
 
04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's after the fact that's
 
04:31:56.109 --> 04:31:56.119 align:start position:0%
after it's signed that's after the
 
04:31:58.229 --> 04:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
Collective Agreement targeting agreement
 
04:31:58.239 --> 04:31:59.550 align:start position:0%
Collective Agreement targeting agreement
is

04:31:59.550 --> 04:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:31:59.560 --> 04:32:01.309 align:start position:0%
is
done

04:32:01.309 --> 04:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:32:04.590 --> 04:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
and the I almost got the impression that
 
04:32:06.269 --> 04:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
it was you know need to see this we'll
 
04:32:08.149 --> 04:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
take care of it and when it's all done
 
04:32:10.910 --> 04:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
said and done then you can see it so I
 
04:32:13.510 --> 04:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
am of course supporting this uh
 
04:32:13.520 --> 04:32:15.149 align:start position:0%
am of course supporting this uh
transparency

04:32:15.149 --> 04:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
04:32:18.590 --> 04:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
Bill and that's all I have thank you
 
04:32:21.030 --> 04:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
recognize individuals who would like to
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
speak anyone on Zoom representative
 
04:32:27.469 --> 04:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
Sullivan first up representative
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you Mr
 
04:32:33.229 --> 04:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
chairman um this bill causes a great
 
04:32:35.830 --> 04:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
deal of problems for public sector
 
04:32:37.630 --> 04:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining and I'd like to
 
04:32:39.309 --> 04:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
try to explain
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
again there is already a 30-day waiting
 
04:32:45.070 --> 04:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
period between the time that a tenative
 
04:32:49.469 --> 04:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
agreement is ratified and um when the um
 
04:32:53.910 --> 04:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
the voters approve it um this adds an
 
04:32:56.830 --> 04:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
additional 30-day waiting period before
 
04:32:59.950 --> 04:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
the ratification can take place and that
 
04:33:03.189 --> 04:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
waiting period serves no purpose during
 
04:33:05.990 --> 04:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
the waiting period between the time that
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
the um the agreement is ratified and the
 
04:33:12.949 --> 04:33:12.959 align:start position:0%
time that the voters um vote on it
 
04:33:15.029 --> 04:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
everyone has every opportunity to review
 
04:33:17.310 --> 04:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
that collective bargaining agreement and
 
04:33:19.029 --> 04:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
in the ratified
 
04:33:22.750 --> 04:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
agreement um if this was
 
04:33:27.150 --> 04:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
approved in 60 days prior to the um the
 
04:33:29.510 --> 04:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
voters uh getting a hold of
 
04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
this the um tenative agreement the
 
04:33:35.310 --> 04:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
unapproved tenative agreement not approv
 
04:33:36.551 --> 04:33:36.561 align:start position:0%
approved by anyone other than the
 
04:33:36.561 --> 04:33:37.551 align:start position:0%
approved by anyone other than the
bargaining

04:33:37.551 --> 04:33:37.561 align:start position:0%
bargaining
 
04:33:39.949 --> 04:33:39.959 align:start position:0%
teams would be
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
posted during that posting period people
 
04:33:44.830 --> 04:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
could review it and if they complain
 
04:33:49.990 --> 04:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
about it and the parties um change it
 
04:33:51.990 --> 04:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
that would result in a new tenative
 
04:33:54.949 --> 04:33:54.959 align:start position:0%
agreement and a new 30-day waiting
 
04:33:57.510 --> 04:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
period that 30-day waiting period would
 
04:34:02.029 --> 04:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
push past the other waiting period and
 
04:34:04.629 --> 04:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
the um collective bargaining agreement
 
04:34:06.590 --> 04:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
could not be Pres presented to the
 
04:34:10.869 --> 04:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
voters um if the voters don't get the um
 
04:34:12.709 --> 04:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement for
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
approval that means that the parties
 
04:34:18.070 --> 04:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
will go probably a full year without an
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
agreement um
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if you you ought to be
 
04:34:27.551 --> 04:34:27.561 align:start position:0%
starting or providing for 90 days or 120
 
04:34:31.709 --> 04:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
days just in case someone complains and
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
the uh agreement gets changed during um
 
04:34:38.869 --> 04:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
prior to ratification so this would be
 
04:34:41.310 --> 04:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
highly problematic and I would point out
 
04:34:43.390 --> 04:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
that the municipal Association
 
04:34:43.400 --> 04:34:44.670 align:start position:0%
that the municipal Association
represents

04:34:44.670 --> 04:34:44.680 align:start position:0%
represents
 
04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%
employers so both employer and employee
 
04:34:50.029 --> 04:34:50.039 align:start position:0%
um rep
 
04:34:52.349 --> 04:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
Representatives find a a problem with
 
04:34:55.990 --> 04:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
this bill um I implore you not to
 
04:34:58.670 --> 04:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
support ought to pass or the amendment
 
04:35:00.269 --> 04:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:35:03.390 --> 04:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
matter thank you any other comments from
 
04:35:09.029 --> 04:35:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:11.910 --> 04:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none any in the lob chamber
 
04:35:14.590 --> 04:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth you have a like
 
04:35:16.750 --> 04:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
to recognize to speak thank you Mr
 
04:35:19.709 --> 04:35:19.719 align:start position:0%
chairman um as I listened to the
 
04:35:19.719 --> 04:35:21.150 align:start position:0%
chairman um as I listened to the
previous

04:35:21.150 --> 04:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
previous
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative advocate for his position
 
04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
he may have convinced me to uh vote the
 
04:35:32.910 --> 04:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
other way he proposed a scenario where
 
04:35:37.830 --> 04:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
um a tentative agreement is reached but
 
04:35:37.840 --> 04:35:39.189 align:start position:0%
um a tentative agreement is reached but
when

04:35:39.189 --> 04:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:35:43.150 --> 04:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
the um stakeholders if you will got a
 
04:35:45.029 --> 04:35:45.039 align:start position:0%
chance to review that tentative
 
04:35:47.390 --> 04:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
agreement they came back to the
 
04:35:50.310 --> 04:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
negotiating team identifying problems
 
04:35:52.269 --> 04:35:52.279 align:start position:0%
with that agreement and actually
 
04:35:54.750 --> 04:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
convinced the negotiating team that they
 
04:35:56.750 --> 04:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
had they had not reached a proper
 
04:35:59.830 --> 04:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
agreement and sent them back to to come
 
04:36:02.429 --> 04:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
up with another one it's hard for me to
 
04:36:05.789 --> 04:36:05.799 align:start position:0%
see how that's the wrong outcome
 
04:36:09.349 --> 04:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh don't we all want to see absolutely
 
04:36:12.269 --> 04:36:12.279 align:start position:0%
the best agreement that can be
 
04:36:16.590 --> 04:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
reached um and and more eyes if more
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
eyes improve that process I can't oppose

mean that if a a tenative agreement is
 
04:37:22.990 --> 04:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
made and it's not settled then upon a
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
new ten tenament agreement the 30-day
 
04:37:28.269 --> 04:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
would start
 
04:37:30.670 --> 04:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
again I can answer that yes yeah
 
04:37:32.709 --> 04:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely and I think going to
 
04:37:35.189 --> 04:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
representative Seward's point and maybe
 
04:37:40.109 --> 04:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
your point that would give the two sides
 
04:37:40.119 --> 04:37:42.109 align:start position:0%
your point that would give the two sides
the

04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:45.029 --> 04:37:45.039 align:start position:0%
uh influence is the wrong word
 
04:37:45.039 --> 04:37:46.990 align:start position:0%
uh influence is the wrong word
the

04:37:46.990 --> 04:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:49.949 --> 04:37:49.959 align:start position:0%
uh to get it right the first time I
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
guess is a way so when you come with
 
04:37:54.109 --> 04:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
your sentive agreement to post it for
 
04:37:57.349 --> 04:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
the 30 days the best thing for both the
 
04:38:00.590 --> 04:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
the union and the public employer is to
 
04:38:03.310 --> 04:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
come with a an agreement that's going to
 
04:38:06.551 --> 04:38:06.561 align:start position:0%
pass muster with the taxpayers and the
 
04:38:10.189 --> 04:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
union members thank you thank you
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
representative representative kahill you
 
04:38:16.949 --> 04:38:16.959 align:start position:0%
recognize thank you Mr chair um I'm
 
04:38:19.390 --> 04:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
wondering looking at all the Amendments
 
04:38:21.070 --> 04:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
that various members of the committee
 
04:38:22.390 --> 04:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
today um is it should we have a higher
 
04:38:27.510 --> 04:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
standard for the people coming to these
 
04:38:28.789 --> 04:38:28.799 align:start position:0%
agreements that they have to get it
 
04:38:31.269 --> 04:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
right the first time and that you know
 
04:38:33.109 --> 04:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
they have to get have another 30-day
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
Penance if they find
 
04:38:39.070 --> 04:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
something I'm sorry representative K was
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
that your comment or question of cot I
 
04:38:44.189 --> 04:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
didn't I apologize I was watching
 
04:38:46.789 --> 04:38:46.799 align:start position:0%
something here it's all right was was
 
04:38:48.189 --> 04:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
that just your comment representative
 
04:38:50.629 --> 04:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
kill that was my that was my question to
 
04:38:50.639 --> 04:38:53.551 align:start position:0%
kill that was my that was my question to
representative

04:38:53.551 --> 04:38:53.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:55.750 --> 04:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
turkot I didn't real I thought this was
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
an EXA it's supposed to be a lot of
 
04:39:01.590 --> 04:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
times this isn't q&amp;as a lot of times
 
04:39:06.070 --> 04:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
we comment then was introduced I
 
04:39:08.590 --> 04:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
it it has been
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
my practice on some things to have a
 
04:39:14.910 --> 04:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
clarification if someone asked for a
 
04:39:16.990 --> 04:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
clarification it's not supposed to be a
 
04:39:19.789 --> 04:39:19.799 align:start position:0%
debate amongst each other it's a time to
 
04:39:21.910 --> 04:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
speak your mind about the
 
04:39:25.551 --> 04:39:25.561 align:start position:0%
bill um someone can always decline I
 
04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
always like to try to keep it so if
 
04:39:30.830 --> 04:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
someone has a question um that is truly
 
04:39:32.750 --> 04:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
clarifying and trying to to get an
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
answer so would you please
 
04:39:36.949 --> 04:39:36.959 align:start position:0%
um if you'd like to restate if it's a
 
04:39:38.110 --> 04:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
clarifying type of question
 
04:39:40.830 --> 04:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
representative kahill uh representative
 
04:39:42.470 --> 04:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know may or may not want to answer
 
04:39:44.230 --> 04:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
it or but I would rather not have a
 
04:39:45.910 --> 04:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
debate if that's
 
04:39:49.470 --> 04:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh well uh no I'm just I was just
 
04:39:51.270 --> 04:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
pointing out that you know sometimes
 
04:39:53.350 --> 04:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
people in their best efforts fall a
 
04:39:55.590 --> 04:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
little bit short need to revise
 
04:39:58.310 --> 04:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
something and that was just the point of
 
04:40:00.868 --> 04:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
my of my uh
 
04:40:03.070 --> 04:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
comment understood thank you very much
 
04:40:05.708 --> 04:40:05.718 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan I may not have
 
04:40:07.310 --> 04:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
been clear enough first time around so
 
04:40:10.628 --> 04:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
let me try again um if you if
 
04:40:13.990 --> 04:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
you if you post it and you change it
 
04:40:15.550 --> 04:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
it's not going to result in a better
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
agreement it's going to result in no
 
04:40:20.430 --> 04:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
agreement because you'll miss that
 
04:40:22.948 --> 04:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
second deadline
 
04:40:26.628 --> 04:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
and you'll go past the district meeting
 
04:40:28.350 --> 04:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
if you go past the district meeting
 
04:40:30.110 --> 04:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
getting a special school district
 
04:40:33.310 --> 04:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
meeting or special meeting before the uh
 
04:40:35.310 --> 04:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
uh the town
 
04:40:38.910 --> 04:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
um is rarely approved anymore so that
 
04:40:40.830 --> 04:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
means that uh the parties would go a
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
full year with no agreement because it
 
04:40:46.708 --> 04:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
blew up during that 30-day waiting
 
04:40:48.990 --> 04:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
period um that's not good for the
 
04:40:51.390 --> 04:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
employer it's not good for the employees
 
04:40:53.110 --> 04:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's always better to have people
 
04:40:56.708 --> 04:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
working under a current Collective Argy
 
04:40:59.470 --> 04:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
agreement um so that is the problem you
 
04:41:01.350 --> 04:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
don't end up with a better agreement you
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
end up with no
 
04:41:06.030 --> 04:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
agreement thank you representative
 
04:41:10.670 --> 04:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
Sullivan I have uh I'd like to comment
 
04:41:15.470 --> 04:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I was really surprised at the lack of
 
04:41:17.628 --> 04:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
emails or phone calls I received
 
04:41:20.510 --> 04:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill um I would have
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
thought it would have been uh with much
 
04:41:24.430 --> 04:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
more Vigor I did receive a phone call
 
04:41:26.948 --> 04:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
and spent 30 minutes on the phone last
 
04:41:30.030 --> 04:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
night uh with Union head and it was a
 
04:41:33.030 --> 04:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
very uh polite and productive phone
 
04:41:36.270 --> 04:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
call and when I said to them well why do
 
04:41:37.948 --> 04:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
you have to have an additional 30-day
 
04:41:40.708 --> 04:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
period why can't the same 30-day period
 
04:41:42.990 --> 04:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
for the posting and the 30-day period
 
04:41:47.190 --> 04:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
before the vote by the whoever the the
 
04:41:49.270 --> 04:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
governing body is be the
 
04:41:52.868 --> 04:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
same same time period not 30 on top of
 
04:41:56.990 --> 04:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
30 you'd have an answer um against that
 
04:41:59.670 --> 04:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
um I asked about the transparency
 
04:42:01.270 --> 04:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
because that's the way I look at
 
04:42:03.788 --> 04:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
this um I do believe since the public
 
04:42:05.150 --> 04:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
pays for this they should have the right
 
04:42:07.470 --> 04:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
to see it and I understand you know
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
there's a always a Rabel Rouser who
 
04:42:12.990 --> 04:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
would would possibly look at this and
 
04:42:15.310 --> 04:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
and make a Ruckus and and and try to
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
change it um but every once in a while
 
04:42:22.670 --> 04:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
in the city of Manchester a contract is
 
04:42:24.628 --> 04:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
ratified and then people read it
 
04:42:26.070 --> 04:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
afterwards they see the things that are
 
04:42:28.990 --> 04:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
in there and some of the things in there
 
04:42:31.270 --> 04:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
where you say there's no increase in the
 
04:42:33.750 --> 04:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
budget but what you did is people got
 
04:42:35.868 --> 04:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
extra things which reduces their
 
04:42:38.350 --> 04:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
productivity from 10 sick days to 12
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
sick days or this and that so while it
 
04:42:42.510 --> 04:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't an increase in the budget which
 
04:42:44.750 --> 04:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
would have had to been reported under
 
04:42:47.070 --> 04:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
the budget process other things have
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
happened um and I don't like that it
 
04:42:50.750 --> 04:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
happens after the fact that people find
 
04:42:53.190 --> 04:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
out about some of these things and if
 
04:42:56.270 --> 04:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
you everything we have to do here as
 
04:42:58.948 --> 04:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
legislators we talk about transparency
 
04:43:00.948 --> 04:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
transparency transparency we don't make
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
these little games this is you know not
 
04:43:04.868 --> 04:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
like some other parts of the country
 
04:43:07.628 --> 04:43:07.638 align:start position:0%
everything we do here is in in the open
 
04:43:10.150 --> 04:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
every bill has to be heard everything
 
04:43:11.910 --> 04:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be done correct we these
 
04:43:13.590 --> 04:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
private meetings we don't make all these
 
04:43:17.190 --> 04:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
deals except maybe consider maybe a h
 
04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
what do you call it at midnight the
 
04:43:21.470 --> 04:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
budget uh on commedia conference and who
 
04:43:24.590 --> 04:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
knows what goes on there but um I was
 
04:43:28.510 --> 04:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
just joking sorry um the um
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
so I like the
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
transparency I I hope that it was not
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
going to cause this delay because
 
04:43:37.750 --> 04:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
obviously I don't want anything to not
 
04:43:40.510 --> 04:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
allow a collective baring agreement to
 
04:43:41.990 --> 04:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
go through because they need to it's
 
04:43:44.550 --> 04:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
good for everybody when they do I am
 
04:43:47.150 --> 04:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
going to um reluctantly a little bit you
 
04:43:49.868 --> 04:43:49.878 align:start position:0%
know 50-50 on this I going to support it
 
04:43:51.390 --> 04:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
uh I'm hoping that doesn't happen and if
 
04:43:53.150 --> 04:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
there's any concrete changes that can
 
04:43:55.270 --> 04:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
come out maybe it happens in the senate
 
04:43:58.670 --> 04:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
or or uh Committee of conference but I I
 
04:44:00.430 --> 04:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
have no problem with someone made a
 
04:44:02.310 --> 04:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
comment to me that oh well we don't like
 
04:44:03.310 --> 04:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
the public to get in because they don't
 
04:44:04.430 --> 04:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
know what they're talking about public
 
04:44:05.070 --> 04:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what they're talking about
 
04:44:06.270 --> 04:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
they're just going to money the waters
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
and I hope that doesn't happen I think
 
04:44:10.470 --> 04:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
90% of the people won't read this if
 
04:44:13.430 --> 04:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
this does pass uh but the ones that do
 
04:44:16.150 --> 04:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's better to be well informed so thank
 
04:44:17.670 --> 04:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
you folks and I see a hand
 
04:44:18.708 --> 04:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
representative SMI and then
 
04:44:21.190 --> 04:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative kahill thank you Mr
 
04:44:24.310 --> 04:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
chairman um everybody I spoke to about
 
04:44:26.948 --> 04:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
this thought transparency wow that's
 
04:44:29.390 --> 04:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
really a great idea we need to have
 
04:44:31.390 --> 04:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
people see what we're
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
doing and then they said but the delay
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
what about the delay what's that going
 
04:44:38.150 --> 04:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
to do with our relationship with our
 
04:44:41.470 --> 04:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
unions and and then they said that this
 
04:44:43.628 --> 04:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
is just more confusing then it would be
 
04:44:46.868 --> 04:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
helpful you make a change it goes back
 
04:44:48.750 --> 04:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
someone says they like it they like the
 
04:44:50.750 --> 04:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
previous one the what was the previous
 
04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
one this isn't clear I think this is
 
04:44:57.350 --> 04:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
this is a bad Bill I think it's faulty
 
04:44:59.110 --> 04:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we should pass it on
 
04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
to anybody else to fix it um we could
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
certainly work on it in commit
 
04:45:06.510 --> 04:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
we could try to find some way to make
 
04:45:09.110 --> 04:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
this smarter but as it stands right now
 
04:45:11.708 --> 04:45:11.718 align:start position:0%
this this is just not the kind of
 
04:45:14.070 --> 04:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
product we should be sending out for the
 
04:45:17.910 --> 04:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
house or the Senate to vote on thank you
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kahill thank
 
04:45:22.628 --> 04:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and uh the previous
 
04:45:24.550 --> 04:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
representative alluded to my concern is
 
04:45:26.390 --> 04:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
that maybe this really needs a bit more
 
04:45:28.948 --> 04:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
time a bit more research so so that we
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:33.280 --> 04:45:36.350 align:start position:0%
 
are

04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:39.670 --> 04:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
are there any additional comments in the
 
04:45:42.910 --> 04:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
L any additional comments on Zoom
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
representative Tumi you're
 
04:45:48.910 --> 04:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
recognized yeah thank you Mr uh
 
04:45:52.510 --> 04:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh you know I I I've negotiated
 
04:45:54.190 --> 04:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of contracts with the public
 
04:45:59.590 --> 04:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
sector uh union rep and no I'm dealing
 
04:46:02.590 --> 04:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
with representatives of the people of of
 
04:46:04.628 --> 04:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
of that whatever community that I'm
 
04:46:07.150 --> 04:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
04:46:10.910 --> 04:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
and uh negotiations are incredibly
 
04:46:13.750 --> 04:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
complex you know you go through all
 
04:46:18.070 --> 04:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
kinds of discussions and arguments over
 
04:46:21.788 --> 04:46:21.798 align:start position:0%
various components of the
 
04:46:25.030 --> 04:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
contract then after you get a tentative
 
04:46:27.788 --> 04:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
agreement now it's put before in
 
04:46:31.788 --> 04:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
nashille for example 85,000 people
 
04:46:34.390 --> 04:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
85,000 people have 30 days to look look
 
04:46:39.110 --> 04:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
at it any one of those 35,000 85,000
 
04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
people can come up with some kind of
 
04:46:43.470 --> 04:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
objection even though they're not part
 
04:46:45.548 --> 04:46:45.558 align:start position:0%
of the contract negotiations but they
 
04:46:48.190 --> 04:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
become part of the contract negotiations
 
04:46:48.200 --> 04:46:49.948 align:start position:0%
become part of the contract negotiations
by

04:46:49.948 --> 04:46:49.958 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:46:53.868 --> 04:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
by this particular bill so all of a
 
04:46:57.510 --> 04:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
sudden one person comes up what two
 
04:46:59.350 --> 04:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
people come up or a group comes up and
 
04:47:01.868 --> 04:47:01.878 align:start position:0%
said well we don't like this and by the
 
04:47:04.788 --> 04:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
way you didn't address this
 
04:47:06.510 --> 04:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
thing that should have been addressed
 
04:47:09.110 --> 04:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden back to the
 
04:47:11.948 --> 04:47:11.958 align:start position:0%
negotiations and then you go back to the
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
negotiations and you go through all
 
04:47:14.160 --> 04:47:15.030 align:start position:0%
negotiations and you go through all
kinds

04:47:15.030 --> 04:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
kinds
 
04:47:19.310 --> 04:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
of months and and and meetings and and
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
those kind of things and then 30 more
 
04:47:25.708 --> 04:47:25.718 align:start position:0%
days somebody else comes up with a it's
 
04:47:27.788 --> 04:47:27.798 align:start position:0%
this is an eternal
 
04:47:30.070 --> 04:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
negotiation and and this what it will
 
04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
turn out to you know in many cases it
 
04:47:35.150 --> 04:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
won't in some cases it won't in many
 
04:47:40.070 --> 04:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
cases it will so it's a nightmare and
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
and PE private sector unions don't have
 
04:47:46.708 --> 04:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
to deal with that and
 
04:47:50.628 --> 04:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh and I hope that we don't make public
 
04:47:53.070 --> 04:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
sector unions have to go through this
 
04:47:57.070 --> 04:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
painful process thank you uh Mr chairman
 
04:47:59.230 --> 04:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
represent turkot then toosan
 
04:48:01.270 --> 04:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative turkot thank you Mr
 
04:48:01.280 --> 04:48:03.030 align:start position:0%
representative turkot thank you Mr
chairman

04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:48:05.470 --> 04:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh quite honestly a lot of the stuff
 
04:48:07.150 --> 04:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
that is being thrown out here nothing
 
04:48:09.670 --> 04:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
more than fear grenades if we have an
 
04:48:12.070 --> 04:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
agreement that is settled one or two
 
04:48:14.948 --> 04:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
individuals in a town of 85,000 is not
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
going to be enough to change an
 
04:48:18.350 --> 04:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
agreement you're not one or two
 
04:48:20.788 --> 04:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
individuals won't do it now if there's a
 
04:48:23.190 --> 04:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
clause or something in that contract
 
04:48:26.150 --> 04:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
where half the town is up in arms as our
 
04:48:28.628 --> 04:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
chairman mentioned before well maybe
 
04:48:31.868 --> 04:48:31.878 align:start position:0%
that's the proper time to get it fixed
 
04:48:34.230 --> 04:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
um to the point about private SE sector
 
04:48:36.150 --> 04:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
is not having to do this I can guarantee
 
04:48:38.270 --> 04:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
you that is the case I'm a member of a
 
04:48:40.430 --> 04:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
private sector Union I was a negotiator
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
for very many for many many years and we
 
04:48:47.750 --> 04:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
had a very similar situation if we
 
04:48:50.510 --> 04:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
brought a good agreement to the table
 
04:48:53.670 --> 04:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
between management and uh for management
 
04:48:55.270 --> 04:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
and our
 
04:48:58.430 --> 04:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
employees it passed we went out on roach
 
04:49:01.350 --> 04:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
show we said what it was the equivalent
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
of putting it up on a board for 30 days
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
and if it was good enough and there was
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
an outrage it went out for a vote if
 
04:49:11.310 --> 04:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
there were things in there that were so
 
04:49:14.910 --> 04:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
honorous that 75% of the pilots didn't
 
04:49:17.270 --> 04:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
like it guess what we did we went back
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
to the bargaining table uh that'll be no
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
difference uh no different than
 
04:49:25.788 --> 04:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
this thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:49:27.390 --> 04:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
representative toos and follow by
 
04:49:27.400 --> 04:49:28.948 align:start position:0%
representative toos and follow by
representative

04:49:28.948 --> 04:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:49:33.030 --> 04:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
Tumi thank you Mr chair so you know as
 
04:49:34.548 --> 04:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
you know I'm filling in on the committee
 
04:49:36.190 --> 04:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
but looking at the language of this bill
 
04:49:38.470 --> 04:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
it seems quite simple to me that it
 
04:49:42.070 --> 04:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
requires a bill to be posted for 30 days
 
04:49:45.190 --> 04:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
and if a majority of the public doesn't
 
04:49:48.070 --> 04:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
like what's in the content of the
 
04:49:49.990 --> 04:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
agreement they certainly should have the
 
04:49:52.230 --> 04:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
right to comment on that as taxpayers
 
04:49:53.470 --> 04:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
they the ones that are paying the bill
 
04:49:55.788 --> 04:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
so it seems pretty straightforward to me
 
04:49:58.030 --> 04:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
in common sense that um that they be
 
04:50:00.110 --> 04:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to to see the agreement during
 
04:50:03.948 --> 04:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
that time time frame thank you thank you
 
04:50:03.958 --> 04:50:08.350 align:start position:0%
that time time frame thank you thank you
representative

04:50:08.350 --> 04:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:11.910 --> 04:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
Tumi you're on mute representative Tumi
 
04:50:14.590 --> 04:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
Len you want to here thank you Mr
 
04:50:17.830 --> 04:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I just wanted to ask the
 
04:50:20.230 --> 04:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
04:50:23.390 --> 04:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
um that for example in the private
 
04:50:25.470 --> 04:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
sector Pilots for
 
04:50:28.948 --> 04:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
example they go through a negotiation
 
04:50:31.030 --> 04:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
they come up with a a tentative
 
04:50:33.868 --> 04:50:33.878 align:start position:0%
agreement they bring it to their members
 
04:50:36.030 --> 04:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
and the public sector you bring it to
 
04:50:40.430 --> 04:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
your members too at your union members
 
04:50:43.270 --> 04:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
but the pilots don't have to bring their
 
04:50:46.830 --> 04:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
agreement to all of the customers of the
 
04:50:49.868 --> 04:50:49.878 align:start position:0%
airline for their input you know if I
 
04:50:52.548 --> 04:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
was a customer of the airline why you
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
know I would like them to make less
 
04:50:57.390 --> 04:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
money so that I my tickets are uh aren't
 
04:50:59.310 --> 04:50:59.320 align:start position:0%
quite as much
 
04:51:03.070 --> 04:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
but the it's not it's not the same thing
 
04:51:04.270 --> 04:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
my point is
 
04:51:08.510 --> 04:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know uh it's definitely not the same
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
thing and and in the case of the pilots
 
04:51:12.470 --> 04:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
they're only going into one entity
 
04:51:15.030 --> 04:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
they're not going to another entity in
 
04:51:16.990 --> 04:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
in the public sector you got to go to
 
04:51:19.868 --> 04:51:19.878 align:start position:0%
your membership and in this case not
 
04:51:22.350 --> 04:51:22.360 align:start position:0%
only do you go to the public but you got
 
04:51:24.990 --> 04:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
to put it in front of them for 30 days
 
04:51:30.190 --> 04:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
for them to to hash out and uh
 
04:51:33.628 --> 04:51:33.638 align:start position:0%
cause to act as another component of the
 
04:51:37.110 --> 04:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
of the negotiations so uh I hope I'm
 
04:51:42.110 --> 04:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
being clear uh but I can just I can just
 
04:51:45.310 --> 04:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
see incredible problems for public
 
04:51:48.910 --> 04:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
sector uh employees and employers by the
 
04:51:53.470 --> 04:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
way thank you thank you any other
 
04:51:56.430 --> 04:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
comments in the
 
04:52:00.310 --> 04:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
L Mr chairman uh representatives bushard
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
and Susi have raised their virtual
 
04:52:02.638 --> 04:52:06.310 align:start position:0%
and Susi have raised their virtual
hands

04:52:06.310 --> 04:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:08.990 --> 04:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
okay I will call on representative buard
 
04:52:10.310 --> 04:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
and then representative Susie
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative buard uh thank you Mr
 
04:52:18.350 --> 04:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
chairman as a lifelong negotiator I I
 
04:52:22.310 --> 04:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
find and in the public sector I find
 
04:52:23.948 --> 04:52:23.958 align:start position:0%
this bill very
 
04:52:27.030 --> 04:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
cumbersome uh when you're talking about
 
04:52:29.430 --> 04:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
a tenative agreement it's a an agreement
 
04:52:31.350 --> 04:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
that is in a
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
process and it's not an agreement until
 
04:52:35.840 --> 04:52:37.430 align:start position:0%
process and it's not an agreement until
both

04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
both
 
04:52:41.628 --> 04:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
parties meet together and ratify it in
 
04:52:44.990 --> 04:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's when it there is the time of 30
 
04:52:47.910 --> 04:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
days where the public can have viewing
 
04:52:47.920 --> 04:52:48.788 align:start position:0%
days where the public can have viewing
of

04:52:48.788 --> 04:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:52:52.990 --> 04:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
it giving the public a view of
 
04:52:58.750 --> 04:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
a tentative agreement prior to that is a
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
matter of confusion to the whole process
 
04:53:04.230 --> 04:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
because that tenative agreement
 
04:53:07.990 --> 04:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
may not be ratified by one of the
 
04:53:12.110 --> 04:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:14.670 --> 04:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Susi then
 
04:53:17.390 --> 04:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative turot thank you Mr
 
04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
chairman um I would just like to get a
 
04:53:23.510 --> 04:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
clarification because I'm going back to
 
04:53:26.430 --> 04:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
the public hearing um and I oppose the
 
04:53:28.628 --> 04:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
bill but I just want a clarification
 
04:53:30.350 --> 04:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
because I think I remember asking a
 
04:53:32.628 --> 04:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
question at the public hearing as to
 
04:53:35.670 --> 04:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not in the 30-day window um
 
04:53:37.708 --> 04:53:37.718 align:start position:0%
and I negotiated contracts for the city
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
of Nash I was on the Executive Board of
 
04:53:41.150 --> 04:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
the nashal firefighters Association for
 
04:53:43.750 --> 04:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
17 years
 
04:53:46.708 --> 04:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
um and I remember asking the question as
 
04:53:48.628 --> 04:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
to whether or not during that 30-day
 
04:53:51.070 --> 04:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
window whether or not the public would
 
04:53:53.430 --> 04:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
have a say or they would be able to do
 
04:53:56.948 --> 04:53:56.958 align:start position:0%
something about it so to me there's a
 
04:53:56.958 --> 04:53:57.990 align:start position:0%
something about it so to me there's a
difference

04:53:57.990 --> 04:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
difference
 
04:54:00.628 --> 04:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
there I believe in transparency I
 
04:54:03.030 --> 04:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
believe that the public should see
 
04:54:05.430 --> 04:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
Collective BR agreements I don't agree
 
04:54:08.470 --> 04:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
it should be this way but my clarifica I
 
04:54:10.030 --> 04:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
would just like clarification as to
 
04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
whether or not the intent of the bill is
 
04:54:12.718 --> 04:54:14.390 align:start position:0%
whether or not the intent of the bill is
to

04:54:14.390 --> 04:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:54:17.070 --> 04:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
allow residents say in the city of Nash
 
04:54:19.590 --> 04:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
may be different in towns but in the
 
04:54:22.548 --> 04:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
city of Nash city of Manchester to allow
 
04:54:25.868 --> 04:54:25.878 align:start position:0%
residents citizens to have
 
04:54:28.830 --> 04:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
say um about things in that contract
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
over that 30
 
04:54:32.868 --> 04:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
days it's my understanding that intent
 
04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:54:36.310 --> 04:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh is to have it public uh so people can
 
04:54:38.310 --> 04:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
review it there still uh you know you
 
04:54:39.750 --> 04:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
have 100 people that don't like it it
 
04:54:40.708 --> 04:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter it's going to the
 
04:54:43.510 --> 04:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
governing body uh in in the city of
 
04:54:44.990 --> 04:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester would be the alderman or the
 
04:54:47.150 --> 04:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
school board and the town my
 
04:54:49.270 --> 04:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is in one of these towns
 
04:54:52.030 --> 04:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
it what comes up is what's presented by
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
the council that's the only thing they
 
04:54:56.350 --> 04:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
can be voted on is what's presented by
 
04:54:59.070 --> 04:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
the um so the
 
04:55:00.670 --> 04:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
individuals if that's what you're
 
04:55:03.030 --> 04:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
talking about repr the individual people
 
04:55:04.548 --> 04:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
they can't make changes it's still the
 
04:55:05.910 --> 04:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
governing body in each one of these
 
04:55:07.670 --> 04:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
things they they can at least have their
 
04:55:09.270 --> 04:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
voice heard to the governing body and
 
04:55:10.548 --> 04:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
the governing body could do what they
 
04:55:11.830 --> 04:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
want they could ignore it or whatever
 
04:55:14.190 --> 04:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of the bill
 
04:55:17.190 --> 04:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
unless I'm represent turkot I again I
 
04:55:18.230 --> 04:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
didn't want to have a question to answer
 
04:55:19.590 --> 04:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
but if you're willing to answer that
 
04:55:21.990 --> 04:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
question I think you just adequately
 
04:55:24.990 --> 04:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
answered it but I I also have to point
 
04:55:26.270 --> 04:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
out that the
 
04:55:29.030 --> 04:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
discussion uh for most of the people on
 
04:55:31.990 --> 04:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
the zoom call so far keeps talking about
 
04:55:35.470 --> 04:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
for the public this is this not is not
 
04:55:38.190 --> 04:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
only for the Public's benefit this is
 
04:55:41.990 --> 04:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
potentially for the union members so the
 
04:55:44.990 --> 04:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
union members have a right it starts to
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
make me wonder why there's such a big
 
04:55:51.270 --> 04:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
push back from some of the unions and
 
04:55:53.590 --> 04:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
they kept saying during the uh the
 
04:55:56.190 --> 04:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
initial hearing well you get to see it
 
04:55:58.310 --> 04:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
when it's signed and it's on the website
 
04:56:00.470 --> 04:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
so this is this is Clarity and
 
04:56:03.628 --> 04:56:03.638 align:start position:0%
transparency not only for the public but
 
04:56:05.830 --> 04:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
also potentially union members just want
 
04:56:07.310 --> 04:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
to make that clear that'll be the last
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
point of it is that all all right
 
04:56:13.030 --> 04:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
represent Susi answer your thank you I
 
04:56:14.510 --> 04:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
think I see a couple of hands I'm going
 
04:56:15.830 --> 04:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
as quick as I can here look at all these
 
04:56:18.510 --> 04:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
things I see represent to roian and then
 
04:56:20.230 --> 04:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
berui I believe representative to roian
 
04:56:20.240 --> 04:56:21.708 align:start position:0%
berui I believe representative to roian
you're

04:56:21.708 --> 04:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:56:27.150 --> 04:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair so just to
 
04:56:30.350 --> 04:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
to comment on the earlier um statement
 
04:56:33.948 --> 04:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
that um in the case of a pilot Union
 
04:56:33.958 --> 04:56:35.548 align:start position:0%
that um in the case of a pilot Union
contract

04:56:35.548 --> 04:56:35.558 align:start position:0%
contract
 
04:56:39.030 --> 04:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
negotiation um it's private and so forth
 
04:56:41.430 --> 04:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
and and that the customer doesn't have
 
04:56:43.788 --> 04:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
have a choice if you will well the
 
04:56:45.230 --> 04:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
customer does have a choice that is the
 
04:56:47.350 --> 04:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
difference in a in a private sector
 
04:56:49.990 --> 04:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
situation um the customer has a choice
 
04:56:51.590 --> 04:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
he doesn't have to fly that particular
 
04:56:53.270 --> 04:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
Airline if he doesn't like what the
 
04:56:55.470 --> 04:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
airline's doing in in the the Union
 
04:56:56.910 --> 04:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
contract affected it to a point where
 
04:56:58.590 --> 04:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
he's not satisfied as a customer he has
 
04:57:00.628 --> 04:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
other choices the taxpayer doesn't have
 
04:57:02.670 --> 04:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
Cho in many cases doesn't have a choice
 
04:57:05.548 --> 04:57:05.558 align:start position:0%
he pays the bill I mean he could sell
 
04:57:07.110 --> 04:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
his house I suppose if it's a if it's a
 
04:57:08.830 --> 04:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
property tax thing but by and large
 
04:57:12.070 --> 04:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's not choice so therefore I truly
 
04:57:13.868 --> 04:57:13.878 align:start position:0%
believe the taxpayer has the right to
 
04:57:16.470 --> 04:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
see the agreement and if he doesn't like
 
04:57:17.830 --> 04:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
the agreement he certainly can comment
 
04:57:20.110 --> 04:57:20.120 align:start position:0%
about it to the governing body that may
 
04:57:25.310 --> 04:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
or may not decide to take that um input
 
04:57:27.548 --> 04:57:27.558 align:start position:0%
uh into consideration when they when
 
04:57:30.910 --> 04:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
they decide what to do but at least they
 
04:57:34.708 --> 04:57:34.718 align:start position:0%
the the taxpayer or the citizen has at
 
04:57:37.470 --> 04:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
least the choice under being able to see
 
04:57:39.270 --> 04:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
the agreement to to
 
04:57:41.548 --> 04:57:41.558 align:start position:0%
comment about their
 
04:57:44.230 --> 04:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
concerns thanks thank you representative
 
04:57:46.430 --> 04:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
Broody followed by representative Smith
 
04:57:49.948 --> 04:57:49.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so many things
 
04:57:51.430 --> 04:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
I want to comment on but I'll keep it
 
04:57:53.830 --> 04:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
short uh first of all union members have
 
04:57:56.230 --> 04:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
to ratify it so that gets that layer
 
04:57:58.590 --> 04:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
taken care of before it goes out to the
 
04:58:02.270 --> 04:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
public also I think you I was surprised
 
04:58:03.750 --> 04:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
to say you didn't hear hear from a lot
 
04:58:06.350 --> 04:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
of people I think we will if we go to
 
04:58:08.230 --> 04:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
pass this I think the town clerks and
 
04:58:09.948 --> 04:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
the you know small towns will come out
 
04:58:12.670 --> 04:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
of the woodwork they can't afford to go
 
04:58:15.430 --> 04:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
a whole year without ratifying a
 
04:58:18.150 --> 04:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
contract they may have some real good
 
04:58:20.430 --> 04:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
employees that are working for them and
 
04:58:22.868 --> 04:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
they want to keep them the next town
 
04:58:26.430 --> 04:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
over offers them more well they could
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
lose some good employees to go to
 
04:58:30.110 --> 04:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
another town to work because they're
 
04:58:32.788 --> 04:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
just getting more money or more benefits
 
04:58:34.708 --> 04:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
or what whatever it is so I think it's
 
04:58:36.590 --> 04:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
going to be really hard for the the
 
04:58:38.670 --> 04:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
towns to set tax rates and keep
 
04:58:41.190 --> 04:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
employees I'll keep it at that although
 
04:58:43.590 --> 04:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
I have a lot to say thank you
 
04:58:45.628 --> 04:58:45.638 align:start position:0%
representative Ry
 
04:58:49.390 --> 04:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr Mr chairman
 
04:58:53.628 --> 04:58:53.638 align:start position:0%
um I'm an alderman in NASA we have
 
04:58:57.628 --> 04:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
our our unions come to us all of the
 
04:58:59.390 --> 04:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
information that people need to make a
 
04:59:01.070 --> 04:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
decision on whether or not we should
 
04:59:04.230 --> 04:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
pass it is available to to the public at
 
04:59:06.910 --> 04:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
that point they can come to hearings for
 
04:59:09.030 --> 04:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
these they can contact us our
 
04:59:11.150 --> 04:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
information is everywhere there's no
 
04:59:13.030 --> 04:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
reason for these to be
 
04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
posted months ahead of time because the
 
04:59:18.150 --> 04:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
decisions are often made just then and
 
04:59:20.390 --> 04:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
there we're very lucky to be able to
 
04:59:22.990 --> 04:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
make decisions quickly if we had to put
 
04:59:25.110 --> 04:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
something aside for a couple of months
 
04:59:27.150 --> 04:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
that would be it would be a waste of
 
04:59:28.670 --> 04:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
time it would be a waste of of Good
 
04:59:30.590 --> 04:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
Feeling with the unions we have no
 
04:59:33.230 --> 04:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
reason to punish them and I I would ask
 
04:59:35.628 --> 04:59:35.638 align:start position:0%
when when uh representative turkot
 
04:59:37.830 --> 04:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
speaks if he would please U make his
 
04:59:40.190 --> 04:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
make himself visible it it would be much
 
04:59:42.230 --> 04:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
easier for us to understand why he's
 
04:59:43.830 --> 04:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
saying what he's saying if we could see
 
04:59:47.270 --> 04:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
what he's please it's just a small thing
 
04:59:47.280 --> 04:59:48.868 align:start position:0%
what he's please it's just a small thing

uh render House Bill 448 inexpedient to
 
05:04:18.628 --> 05:04:18.638 align:start position:0%

to legislate is that
 
05:04:21.948 --> 05:04:21.958 align:start position:0%
seconded second seconded by
 
05:04:24.510 --> 05:04:24.520 align:start position:0%

05:04:29.910 --> 05:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
chairman this study idea has come in the
 
05:04:35.190 --> 05:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
past I believe and at that time it was
 
05:04:38.990 --> 05:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
deemed to lead to a very large cost to
 
05:04:43.470 --> 05:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities if uh gone to
 
05:04:46.270 --> 05:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
fruition um to switch the state to an
 
05:04:49.708 --> 05:04:49.718 align:start position:0%
entirely new system would be very very
 
05:04:52.670 --> 05:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
costly and at this point in time I think
 
05:04:54.628 --> 05:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
that would lead to an unnecessary
 
05:04:57.190 --> 05:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy and an unnecessary expense
 
05:04:58.548 --> 05:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:05:03.110 --> 05:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
state that's it thank you have any
 
05:05:07.350 --> 05:05:07.360 align:start position:0%

05:05:15.670 --> 05:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative infantine representative
 
05:05:18.990 --> 05:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you Mr chairman um just
 
05:05:21.590 --> 05:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
like to clarify this uh study committee
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
has not come up in the past um there was
 
05:05:27.270 --> 05:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
a bill that came up last year um it was
 
05:05:29.670 --> 05:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
um a full commitment to go to public
 
05:05:32.910 --> 05:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
sector OIP um I acknowledge there was a
 
05:05:36.070 --> 05:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
problem with that um and it was unknown
 
05:05:38.670 --> 05:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
what the costs might be um or the
 
05:05:41.230 --> 05:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
benefits might be because this will also
 
05:05:43.190 --> 05:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
result in federal money coming back to
 
05:05:45.910 --> 05:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if we make the commitment
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
the study committee is not a full
 
05:05:50.110 --> 05:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
commitment to do public sector OIP what
 
05:05:52.470 --> 05:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
it will do is it'll provide valuable
 
05:05:55.470 --> 05:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
information as uh Deputy Commissioner
 
05:05:55.480 --> 05:05:56.628 align:start position:0%
information as uh Deputy Commissioner
Ogden

05:05:56.628 --> 05:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
Ogden
 
05:06:00.030 --> 05:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
indicated the Department of Labor will
 
05:06:03.708 --> 05:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
finally know how their safy standards
 
05:06:06.270 --> 05:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
compared to the um uh the oosha
 
05:06:08.750 --> 05:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
standards they don't have a full
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of that now and um the
 
05:06:14.430 --> 05:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner has told me that um
 
05:06:17.190 --> 05:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
they can't make the commitment to do
 
05:06:20.270 --> 05:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
that study unless we tell them to um so
 
05:06:23.910 --> 05:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
this um this bill tells them to do the
 
05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
study um we'll give them valuable
 
05:06:28.548 --> 05:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
information and will let us make an
 
05:06:30.830 --> 05:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
informed decision down the road as to
 
05:06:33.030 --> 05:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not we want to commit to do
 
05:06:37.350 --> 05:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
public sector oi um we I should have
 
05:06:39.110 --> 05:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
proposed this last year I'll acknowledge
 
05:06:43.230 --> 05:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
that um but um I believe that this this
 
05:06:45.590 --> 05:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
will will provide very valuable
 
05:06:46.910 --> 05:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
information to the state of New
 
05:06:49.868 --> 05:06:49.878 align:start position:0%

05:07:23.350 --> 05:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
year career um and
 
05:07:25.788 --> 05:07:25.798 align:start position:0%
uh I think one was mechanical failure
 
05:07:29.350 --> 05:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
and two were were uh employee mistakes
 
05:07:34.910 --> 05:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh um I Haven an 10 certification card
 
05:07:36.830 --> 05:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I learned some valuable information
 
05:07:40.750 --> 05:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
about that when I was a teenager I used
 
05:07:43.390 --> 05:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
to work on a masonry crew anyone's ever
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
been down on Amber Street in ashaa knows
 
05:07:47.708 --> 05:07:47.718 align:start position:0%
all those concrete buildings and block
 
05:07:49.948 --> 05:07:49.958 align:start position:0%
buildings down there well I was a Mason
 
05:07:51.310 --> 05:07:51.320 align:start position:0%
tender on those things let me tell you
 
05:07:53.788 --> 05:07:53.798 align:start position:0%
we did some dumb things back then like a
 
05:07:57.350 --> 05:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
monkey jumping around on on uh on
 
05:08:00.270 --> 05:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
reinforcing on on staging one day some
 
05:08:02.270 --> 05:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
guy had a bucket of mud as they call it
 
05:08:04.350 --> 05:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
mortar and they bring it over and he
 
05:08:07.110 --> 05:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
hits the the the scaffolding so hard I
 
05:08:08.548 --> 05:08:08.558 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure whether I was jumping down
 
05:08:09.910 --> 05:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
or jumping on the
 
05:08:12.510 --> 05:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
building and so I'm not proud of that
 
05:08:16.070 --> 05:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
but those things happen now we we all
 
05:08:17.830 --> 05:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
know about wearing our hard hats and if
 
05:08:19.230 --> 05:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
you're six feet to trench you have to
 
05:08:20.910 --> 05:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
have a ladder that goes three feet above
 
05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
and all these other things we do so
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
people don't
 
05:08:26.708 --> 05:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
die and some of it's really really
 
05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
simple no one should go to work and
 
05:08:32.628 --> 05:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
die you know it's just that's way I feel
 
05:08:34.310 --> 05:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
about it to do as best you
 
05:08:38.110 --> 05:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
can why does a municipal worker have to
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
follow not have to follow a rule in a
 
05:08:42.830 --> 05:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
trench with a hard hat with
 
05:08:45.150 --> 05:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
glasses um
 
05:08:49.150 --> 05:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
that a private sector employee does I
 
05:08:51.788 --> 05:08:51.798 align:start position:0%
don't know what Richard Nixon thought of
 
05:08:55.030 --> 05:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
in 1972 when he created OSHA um if he
 
05:08:58.310 --> 05:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
meant that to be but um you know I got a
 
05:09:00.788 --> 05:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
lot of hard time from my fellow
 
05:09:03.310 --> 05:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
Republicans years ago
 
05:09:07.590 --> 05:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
when I voted to disallow smoking in
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
restaurants will How Could You Dare do
 
05:09:13.070 --> 05:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
that it's business's choice so well no
 
05:09:14.910 --> 05:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
not really you name any other place
 
05:09:16.390 --> 05:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
where someone would be allowed to be in
 
05:09:19.750 --> 05:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
a confined space with carcinogenic
 
05:09:21.628 --> 05:09:21.638 align:start position:0%
fumes now you probably have to wear a
 
05:09:23.270 --> 05:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
respirator and some of the things
 
05:09:25.670 --> 05:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
according to OSHA now I did say to
 
05:09:27.270 --> 05:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan I would support
 
05:09:29.628 --> 05:09:29.638 align:start position:0%
his his bill but you know fire and
 
05:09:31.030 --> 05:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
police can't really abide by that
 
05:09:32.310 --> 05:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
because ocean would probably tell tell a
 
05:09:33.548 --> 05:09:33.558 align:start position:0%
firefighter not to walk into that
 
05:09:35.510 --> 05:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
burning building and he probably oosha
 
05:09:36.830 --> 05:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
would probably say to that police
 
05:09:39.510 --> 05:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
officer not to go into a firefight so
 
05:09:40.750 --> 05:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
there's certain things that aren't
 
05:09:43.270 --> 05:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
obviously going to fit with OSHA and
 
05:09:45.230 --> 05:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
Municipal workers but a lot of things
 
05:09:47.830 --> 05:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
are simple and uh I don't know about the
 
05:09:49.590 --> 05:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
cost I know Maine has done something I'd
 
05:09:51.070 --> 05:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
be interested in seeing that and I would
 
05:09:52.390 --> 05:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
be interested in sitting on this
 
05:09:55.350 --> 05:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
committee should that be the case so um
 
05:09:57.628 --> 05:09:57.638 align:start position:0%
I respect anyone who chooses to vote
 
05:10:00.708 --> 05:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
however they want to on this bill uh but
 
05:10:03.948 --> 05:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
that's just my personal
 
05:10:06.670 --> 05:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh beliefs from my uh my tenure and my
 
05:10:10.670 --> 05:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
job and such so thank you uh folks for
 
05:10:12.230 --> 05:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
indulging me anyone else would like to
 
05:10:14.350 --> 05:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
speak on the
 
05:10:18.190 --> 05:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
matter oh represent SMI you're too
 
05:10:21.350 --> 05:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
kind I don't uh I thought you were
 
05:10:22.270 --> 05:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
pointing at someone down there
 
05:10:22.280 --> 05:10:24.470 align:start position:0%
pointing at someone down there
representative

05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:10:27.548 --> 05:10:27.558 align:start position:0%
seaworth and I might Point your
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:34.350 --> 05:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
way probably pick me up uh thank you Mr
 
05:10:34.360 --> 05:10:36.430 align:start position:0%
way probably pick me up uh thank you Mr
chairman

05:10:36.430 --> 05:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:10:39.670 --> 05:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
um I agree with many of things you've
 
05:10:45.750 --> 05:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
said and I'm honestly torn on this bill
 
05:10:50.070 --> 05:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
um first vot sorry
 
05:10:50.080 --> 05:10:51.868 align:start position:0%
um first vot sorry
sorry

05:10:51.868 --> 05:10:51.878 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
although you mentioned a couple of
 
05:10:57.430 --> 05:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
issues um some things with the cost I
 
05:11:01.030 --> 05:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly skeptical and I think we
 
05:11:04.390 --> 05:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
do want to be in formed about
 
05:11:08.070 --> 05:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
this decision before we uh go ahead and
 
05:11:12.750 --> 05:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
take it and um studying it in a
 
05:11:15.750 --> 05:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
legislative committee is is probably the
 
05:11:20.990 --> 05:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
right way to go um why I I'm I'm torn on
 
05:11:23.548 --> 05:11:23.558 align:start position:0%
this is I've also spoken to some people
 
05:11:27.868 --> 05:11:27.878 align:start position:0%
outside of the committee and
 
05:11:31.590 --> 05:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
um it has been impressed upon me the
 
05:11:35.070 --> 05:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
difficulty of even holding our standing
 
05:11:37.230 --> 05:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
committee meetings and getting them done
 
05:11:42.150 --> 05:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner is is a challenge and
 
05:11:44.590 --> 05:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh I think we're doing very well here in
 
05:11:49.750 --> 05:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
our committee um but the resources that
 
05:11:52.708 --> 05:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
the legislature has are being
 
05:11:55.990 --> 05:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
strained and my concern is with having a
 
05:11:59.310 --> 05:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
study committee um that this is a lot of
 
05:12:00.628 --> 05:12:00.638 align:start position:0%
work it's a lot of work for the
 
05:12:02.910 --> 05:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
department and it's going to take a lot
 
05:12:05.708 --> 05:12:05.718 align:start position:0%
of investment for the
 
05:12:08.830 --> 05:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
legislators that are assigned to it uh
 
05:12:11.230 --> 05:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
we have to convince it a senator that
 
05:12:14.030 --> 05:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
that they need to make that commitment
 
05:12:16.670 --> 05:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
and we need to have the time to really
 
05:12:20.030 --> 05:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
go through this data and it I I'm just
 
05:12:25.270 --> 05:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
worried that um if we put this forth now
 
05:12:27.548 --> 05:12:27.558 align:start position:0%
in the environment that we're struggling
 
05:12:30.310 --> 05:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
with it it's not going to
 
05:12:33.990 --> 05:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
be met in the way that it deserves to be
 
05:12:36.670 --> 05:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
met so for that reason I'm going to have
 
05:12:37.708 --> 05:12:37.718 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
05:12:41.948 --> 05:12:41.958 align:start position:0%
no but I it's not a rejection of the
 
05:12:44.548 --> 05:12:44.558 align:start position:0%
concept it's it's concerned with the
 
05:12:48.070 --> 05:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
details thank you chairman thank you I
 
05:12:49.868 --> 05:12:49.878 align:start position:0%
see a hand representative Sullivan but
 
05:12:51.430 --> 05:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
you look like you're Frozen oh there you
 
05:12:55.150 --> 05:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
are no just sit representa Sullivan
 
05:12:58.030 --> 05:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
you're recognize for
 
05:13:00.628 --> 05:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
motion take the opportunity to try to
 
05:13:02.548 --> 05:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
persuade my friend uh representative
 
05:13:06.070 --> 05:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
seaworth um number one
 
05:13:08.430 --> 05:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
um most of the work is going to be done
 
05:13:10.270 --> 05:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
by the department you are correct it
 
05:13:12.628 --> 05:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
will be a lot of work for them I see the
 
05:13:14.670 --> 05:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
the committee as not having as much
 
05:13:16.470 --> 05:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
heavy lifting to do because they'll be
 
05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
primarily overseeing what the U
 
05:13:21.670 --> 05:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
department is doing so um that's number
 
05:13:25.310 --> 05:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
one number two um this bill very
 
05:13:29.628 --> 05:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
intentionally um gives until um November
 
05:13:29.638 --> 05:13:30.750 align:start position:0%
intentionally um gives until um November
of

05:13:30.750 --> 05:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:13:34.750 --> 05:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
2022 um for the report to to come out um
 
05:13:37.110 --> 05:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
because it is a lot of work and it also
 
05:13:41.310 --> 05:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
gets us beyond the um uh the pandemic if
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
necessary um so um it gives more time um
 
05:13:49.628 --> 05:13:49.638 align:start position:0%
and um enough time to to get the work
 
05:13:53.628 --> 05:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
done and um I think and if we wait till
 
05:13:56.030 --> 05:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
next year we won't have the luxury of
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
two years because uh we'll be coming up
 
05:14:01.030 --> 05:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
on the end of the two two-year term and
 
05:14:03.670 --> 05:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that really works best in
 
05:14:05.628 --> 05:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
the first year of a two-year term so
 
05:14:07.350 --> 05:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
that there's enough time to make make
 
05:14:09.868 --> 05:14:09.878 align:start position:0%
the study and I have to tell you that um
 
05:14:14.750 --> 05:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
perpetually enthusiastic um uh Rudy
 
05:14:17.590 --> 05:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
Ogden um Embraces the idea of doing this
 
05:14:21.830 --> 05:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
study um um but he simply needs to be um
 
05:14:24.830 --> 05:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
given the the go-ahead by um uh the
 
05:14:28.788 --> 05:14:28.798 align:start position:0%
legislature to do it so I U hope maybe
 
05:14:32.470 --> 05:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
I've turned your head a bit
 
05:14:34.750 --> 05:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
any other comments from any members of
 
05:14:36.430 --> 05:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
the committee in the
 
05:14:39.868 --> 05:14:39.878 align:start position:0%
lob seeing none any additional online I
 
05:14:41.548 --> 05:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
see I see representative Broody you're
 
05:14:45.548 --> 05:14:45.558 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chairman um this
 
05:14:47.830 --> 05:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
is going to take a little time a little
 
05:14:51.270 --> 05:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
effort but how much time and effort is
 
05:14:53.150 --> 05:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
it for us to sit here and discuss
 
05:14:55.230 --> 05:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
something compared to somebody losing
 
05:14:57.270 --> 05:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
their life or somebody getting in an

time and effort that we put in is is
 
05:15:11.670 --> 05:15:11.680 align:start position:0%

infantine vote Yes vot is 10 10 so what
 
05:19:25.350 --> 05:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
we have here is a situation where the
 
05:19:29.110 --> 05:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
bill will go to the floor without
 
05:19:34.190 --> 05:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:37.390 --> 05:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh not really a blur it's a
 
05:19:40.270 --> 05:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh paragraph to be I'm
 
05:19:41.750 --> 05:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
sorry represent what do you call it
 
05:19:43.788 --> 05:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
specifically it will go without
 
05:19:45.750 --> 05:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation correct but then then
 
05:19:48.070 --> 05:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
each individual each one from either
 
05:19:52.270 --> 05:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
side of the vote uh will write um a blur
 
05:19:53.990 --> 05:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
but I think it's their recommendation as
 
05:19:56.430 --> 05:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
to why the bill either ought to pass or
 
05:19:58.150 --> 05:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
should be inexpedient to
 
05:20:02.390 --> 05:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
legislate so um
 
05:20:04.788 --> 05:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
uh represent Hoff if you would write one
 
05:20:10.910 --> 05:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
on behalf of of the uh itl and um
 
05:20:14.510 --> 05:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'll representative Sullivan will grab
 
05:20:16.310 --> 05:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
will let us know who will be writing one
 
05:20:18.990 --> 05:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
in favor of the oop pass correct put me
 
05:20:24.310 --> 05:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:27.430 --> 05:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
San I want to hear one more Bill uh on
 
05:20:28.430 --> 05:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
the executive session then we're going
 
05:20:30.190 --> 05:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
to take a five or 10 minute break if
 
05:20:32.910 --> 05:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
that's all right with everyone
 
05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
um the next bill in front of us is House

05:21:12.230 --> 05:21:12.240 align:start position:0%

chairman

05:21:16.510 --> 05:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:21:19.948 --> 05:21:19.958 align:start position:0%
um sometimes a study committee like the
 
05:21:22.628 --> 05:21:22.638 align:start position:0%
one that we were so divided
 
05:21:26.590 --> 05:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
on uh seeks information and helps us
 
05:21:28.830 --> 05:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
make a better decision other times when
 
05:21:32.390 --> 05:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
I read a study committee I can see the
 
05:21:36.708 --> 05:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
results that are uh intended for that
 
05:21:39.390 --> 05:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
committee produce written right into the
 
05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
bill and um the way this was presented
 
05:21:45.708 --> 05:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
there I think there are some interesting
 
05:21:49.070 --> 05:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
questions about wage about cost of
 
05:21:52.948 --> 05:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
living um but I'm really uncomfortable
 
05:21:55.708 --> 05:21:55.718 align:start position:0%
with the assumptions that are loaded
 
05:21:57.910 --> 05:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
into the front end of this study and I
 
05:21:57.920 --> 05:21:59.628 align:start position:0%
into the front end of this study and I
cannot

05:21:59.628 --> 05:21:59.638 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
05:22:01.990 --> 05:22:02.000 align:start position:0%

Representatives

05:22:13.430 --> 05:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
05:22:16.150 --> 05:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
online representative SMI followed by
 
05:22:16.160 --> 05:22:18.190 align:start position:0%
online representative SMI followed by
representative

05:22:18.190 --> 05:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:22:20.270 --> 05:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
infant thank you very much I'll be very
 
05:22:21.670 --> 05:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
quick because I know everybody could use
 
05:22:23.910 --> 05:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
a little break um I'm an alderman in
 
05:22:27.110 --> 05:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
NASA and I can see the effects of uh
 
05:22:29.670 --> 05:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and near minimum wage on on
 
05:22:31.788 --> 05:22:31.798 align:start position:0%
the people but but I can also see the
 
05:22:33.548 --> 05:22:33.558 align:start position:0%
effects on our soup kitchen The Strain
 
05:22:35.990 --> 05:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
on our nonprofits organizations that
 
05:22:38.868 --> 05:22:38.878 align:start position:0%
take up the slack in the local economy
 
05:22:41.190 --> 05:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
um because many of uh our jobs are
 
05:22:45.070 --> 05:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
service service jobs um and and that
 
05:22:48.070 --> 05:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
creates low-wage worker uh that lives in
 
05:22:50.670 --> 05:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
in our city a strain on the library that
 
05:22:53.270 --> 05:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
provides services the welfare department
 
05:22:55.628 --> 05:22:55.638 align:start position:0%
um so many jobs pay less than it takes
 
05:22:57.910 --> 05:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
to actually live here or live past one
 
05:23:00.708 --> 05:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
flat tire or one visit to the doctor so
 
05:23:02.548 --> 05:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
uh every year a minimum wage Bill comes
 
05:23:04.310 --> 05:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
through and we hear this about it and we
 
05:23:06.310 --> 05:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
hear that about it but we don't hear how
 
05:23:09.590 --> 05:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
it actually affects the state it affects
 
05:23:12.590 --> 05:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
people but it affects the businesses it
 
05:23:14.910 --> 05:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
affects the cities it affects the towns
 
05:23:16.910 --> 05:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
it affects all of us and so an
 
05:23:19.910 --> 05:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at the whole picture
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
really isn't leaning towards one way or
 
05:23:24.510 --> 05:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
another it's actually looking to see
 
05:23:26.868 --> 05:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
what we need to be a better State I'll
 
05:23:29.110 --> 05:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
leave it at that and thank you for
 
05:23:32.030 --> 05:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
listening thank you representative
 
05:23:34.470 --> 05:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
Smith um I'll wait I'll wait and speak
 
05:23:38.350 --> 05:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
to the end anyone else like to speak
 
05:23:41.510 --> 05:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
online I guess I am all right uh I have
 
05:23:44.310 --> 05:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
no problem uh in fact I agree with some
 
05:23:45.910 --> 05:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
of the comments representative Schmidt
 
05:23:48.670 --> 05:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
made um I made a call to the Department
 
05:23:50.150 --> 05:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
of Labor and Department of Employment
 
05:23:53.590 --> 05:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
Securities and I asked them if they had
 
05:23:55.510 --> 05:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
the bandwidth and the people to do this
 
05:23:57.470 --> 05:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
right now given the issues that
 
05:23:58.670 --> 05:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
department of labor and employment
 
05:24:00.548 --> 05:24:00.558 align:start position:0%
Securities are dealing with with Co and
 
05:24:01.948 --> 05:24:01.958 align:start position:0%
while they would be willing to do
 
05:24:04.628 --> 05:24:04.638 align:start position:0%
anything that we ask them to do they
 
05:24:06.788 --> 05:24:06.798 align:start position:0%
they have other things for other
 
05:24:08.310 --> 05:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
individuals to do right now they feel is
 
05:24:11.110 --> 05:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
more pressing so we continue to talk and
 
05:24:13.788 --> 05:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned in the hearing uh and I
 
05:24:16.110 --> 05:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
have pulled off the
 
05:24:19.830 --> 05:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
um I have here I this is for Hillsboro
 
05:24:24.510 --> 05:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
County MIT on an annual basis produces a
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
very nice report and on this report it
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
goes every state and every County within
 
05:24:33.270 --> 05:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
every state and provides a living wage a
 
05:24:36.990 --> 05:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
property W excuse me poverty wage and a
 
05:24:39.270 --> 05:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and it provides it in the
 
05:24:41.510 --> 05:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
categories of an adult with no children
 
05:24:44.150 --> 05:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
one children two or three two adults no
 
05:24:46.470 --> 05:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
children one two and three then they
 
05:24:47.948 --> 05:24:47.958 align:start position:0%
talk about all the different things in
 
05:24:49.868 --> 05:24:49.878 align:start position:0%
the typical expenses they outline the
 
05:24:52.510 --> 05:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
expense of food Child Care Medical
 
05:24:56.470 --> 05:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
housing Transportation uh taxes all
 
05:24:58.430 --> 05:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
these things for the same categories
 
05:25:00.390 --> 05:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
adult with no children one two three two
 
05:25:02.470 --> 05:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
adult know children one two or three
 
05:25:05.430 --> 05:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
children this is extremely detailed
 
05:25:07.150 --> 05:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
information and I didn't yet not know
 
05:25:09.470 --> 05:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
that this was out there um and I think
 
05:25:11.390 --> 05:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
it would be really duplicating the
 
05:25:14.070 --> 05:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
efforts I mean this you know you know
 
05:25:15.670 --> 05:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm wrong I think the MIT guys are
 
05:25:17.990 --> 05:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty smart guys and they have a
 
05:25:19.830 --> 05:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
lot of good things and and one of the
 
05:25:20.990 --> 05:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
comments made to be on one of the
 
05:25:22.628 --> 05:25:22.638 align:start position:0%
Departments is we don't have the
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
economists and we don't have the the the
 
05:25:28.350 --> 05:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
ability to do this as well as they do um
 
05:25:30.948 --> 05:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
so for the for the for the reason that
 
05:25:32.230 --> 05:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
this information I wish someone had
 
05:25:33.590 --> 05:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
brought this information to me I wish I
 
05:25:35.350 --> 05:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
had known about it a while ago I know it
 
05:25:37.030 --> 05:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
was mentioned I didn't really take note
 
05:25:39.310 --> 05:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
of it in the in the Committee hearing as
 
05:25:40.990 --> 05:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
much as I should have but there's a
 
05:25:42.788 --> 05:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of information down
 
05:25:44.830 --> 05:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
here by County for the entire State of
 
05:25:47.948 --> 05:25:47.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire again repeating myself a
 
05:25:50.070 --> 05:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
living wage a poverty wage and a minimum
 
05:25:52.350 --> 05:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
wage uh and and at this point the
 
05:25:54.470 --> 05:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
information is here available and and
 
05:25:56.548 --> 05:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
really um don't want to take away the
 
05:25:58.910 --> 05:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
resources away from um the Department of
 
05:26:01.030 --> 05:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
Labor Employment Securities at this time
 
05:26:03.390 --> 05:26:03.400 align:start position:0%
um so I'll be voting uh in favor of the
 
05:26:06.470 --> 05:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
itl representative Sullivan you're
 
05:26:09.390 --> 05:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you I'll be very brief
 
05:26:11.470 --> 05:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
um you and I had a chat about this and
 
05:26:14.190 --> 05:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
um uh the
 
05:26:18.430 --> 05:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
um that MIT um uh data is is very
 
05:26:21.708 --> 05:26:21.718 align:start position:0%
valuable data um but they're only
 
05:26:23.868 --> 05:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
because they're doing it nationwide it's
 
05:26:25.590 --> 05:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to do it as thoroughly as
 
05:26:29.750 --> 05:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
would be helpful and uh a uh County like
 
05:26:33.948 --> 05:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
Graft in is very diverse um it uh
 
05:26:36.750 --> 05:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
includes towns like uh H Hanover and
 
05:26:41.470 --> 05:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
Lebanon with uh probably quite High um
 
05:26:45.990 --> 05:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh living wages um and then um a town
 
05:26:49.830 --> 05:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
like Woodsville which uh is a completely
 
05:26:53.110 --> 05:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
different type of economy so I I think a
 
05:26:54.990 --> 05:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
study like this could drill down a
 
05:26:56.948 --> 05:26:56.958 align:start position:0%
little bit deeper than what the MIT MIT
 
05:26:59.030 --> 05:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
does and I would expect that they would
 
05:27:02.628 --> 05:27:02.638 align:start position:0%
probably use some of the MIT data um to
 
05:27:06.470 --> 05:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
um launch their their effort so um but I
 
05:27:09.030 --> 05:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
I I agree with you on the MIT the value
 
05:27:12.190 --> 05:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:14.270 --> 05:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
data any additional comments from the
 
05:27:16.548 --> 05:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
members of the committee seeing none any
 
05:27:20.390 --> 05:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:22.910 --> 05:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
recognize yeah that there's a another
 
05:27:25.430 --> 05:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
component to to this bill and it has to
 
05:27:29.590 --> 05:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
do with uh people on public assistance
 
05:27:31.830 --> 05:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
in it it's say sad that anybody that
 
05:27:34.830 --> 05:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
works fulltime or close to full-time has
 
05:27:36.470 --> 05:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
to be on public
 
05:27:38.910 --> 05:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
assistance but it's it's you know really
 
05:27:42.150 --> 05:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
important that we know what scale of of
 
05:27:44.628 --> 05:27:44.638 align:start position:0%
of of that is happening and it would be
 
05:27:48.670 --> 05:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
very valuable for us to make arguments
 
05:27:51.590 --> 05:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
about it but on this another aspect of
 
05:27:57.270 --> 05:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
it too is that if an employer has isn't
 
05:27:59.470 --> 05:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
paying enough and his employees have to
 
05:28:01.270 --> 05:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
go on public assist
 
05:28:04.110 --> 05:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
he gets a competitive advantage over an
 
05:28:08.788 --> 05:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
employer that gives uh good pay and
 
05:28:11.590 --> 05:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
benefits and uh I think that information
 
05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
needs to be known for whatever reason
 
05:28:16.270 --> 05:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
you know it's I think it's important
 
05:28:18.830 --> 05:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
that we know how much the public is
 
05:28:26.470 --> 05:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
paying uh for paying benefits for for uh
 
05:28:29.590 --> 05:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
employees thank you thank you any
 
05:28:31.910 --> 05:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
additional uh individuals wishing to
 
05:28:34.830 --> 05:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
speak on the behalf of this bill on uh
 
05:28:37.110 --> 05:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
on Zoom representative
 
05:28:41.628 --> 05:28:41.638 align:start position:0%
buard um thank you Mr chairman uh that
 
05:28:45.230 --> 05:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
MIT calculator is a great resource and
 
05:28:46.830 --> 05:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
I've used it in the
 
05:28:50.510 --> 05:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
past uh in establishing my opinion when
 
05:28:53.150 --> 05:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
it comes to a minimum wage however I am
 
05:28:57.150 --> 05:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill for another reason
 
05:29:00.070 --> 05:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
so that we can find out what does it
 
05:29:02.270 --> 05:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
cost as
 
05:29:06.830 --> 05:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for having all these low wage
 
05:29:10.150 --> 05:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
workers that we have to provide for them
 
05:29:12.390 --> 05:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
I think that is something we need to
 
05:29:13.830 --> 05:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
have a study
 
05:29:16.430 --> 05:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
about thank
 
05:29:21.070 --> 05:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you I don't see any other hand
 
05:29:23.470 --> 05:29:23.480 align:start position:0%

yeah I think I got it right a couple
 
05:40:57.788 --> 05:40:57.798 align:start position:0%
things so representative nunus you have
 
05:40:59.868 --> 05:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
more fun here or over in
 
05:41:02.230 --> 05:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
Finance well ways and mean oh ways and
 
05:41:05.868 --> 05:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
mean sorry this is this is my home I I
 
05:41:08.708 --> 05:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
came to labor last term so this is this
 
05:41:10.390 --> 05:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
is like you know I don't get to spend as
 
05:41:11.628 --> 05:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
much time here now because I'm between
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
two committees I get a I get a little
 
05:41:16.868 --> 05:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
lost sometimes but U but no it's good to
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
be back in labor again must be difficult
 
05:41:20.548 --> 05:41:20.558 align:start position:0%
doing two committees I have a hard
 
05:41:22.468 --> 05:41:22.478 align:start position:0%
enough time with one well that that's a
 
05:41:25.590 --> 05:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
very heavy committee yes and the time
 
05:41:28.628 --> 05:41:28.638 align:start position:0%
commitment is several days per week so
 
05:41:31.910 --> 05:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
um um I'm happy to help out but it does
 
05:41:34.310 --> 05:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
you know sort of put me in a situation
 
05:41:35.708 --> 05:41:35.718 align:start position:0%
where I have to run down the hall we get
 
05:41:37.910 --> 05:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
back and forth each each one and
 
05:41:39.590 --> 05:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully that'll straighten itself out
 
05:41:42.110 --> 05:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
as we go through the through our first
 
05:41:44.468 --> 05:41:44.478 align:start position:0%
year of this plan financing Ways and
 
05:41:46.590 --> 05:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
Means are just unbelievable the
 
05:41:48.830 --> 05:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
commitment you have to make to those uh
 
05:41:50.948 --> 05:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
and then Mark Warden will tell you how
 
05:41:53.708 --> 05:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
uh last year mark you had 80 bills in
 
05:41:54.948 --> 05:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
Commerce or something like that I think
 
05:41:56.230 --> 05:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
they should break it into Commerce one
 
05:41:58.150 --> 05:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
and commerce
 
05:42:02.310 --> 05:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
two workload in Commerce so when when
 
05:42:04.350 --> 05:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
you're when you're a freshman you don't
 
05:42:04.360 --> 05:42:05.350 align:start position:0%
you're when you're a freshman you don't
know

05:42:05.350 --> 05:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:42:08.788 --> 05:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
anything they uh say do you
 
05:42:11.070 --> 05:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
um well what Jun do you want to be on
 
05:42:12.788 --> 05:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
someone say well what has the fewest
 
05:42:15.628 --> 05:42:15.638 align:start position:0%
amount of bills you know and you never
 
05:42:19.110 --> 05:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
know though well we've had I don't know
 
05:42:21.030 --> 05:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative Sullivan's online here
 
05:42:23.468 --> 05:42:23.478 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many you guys had the
 
05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
last four years here um that I wasn't
 
05:42:29.548 --> 05:42:29.558 align:start position:0%
here but I think about 25 was the the
 
05:42:32.550 --> 05:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
the highest 25 or
 
05:42:32.560 --> 05:42:34.190 align:start position:0%
the highest 25 or
[Music]

05:42:34.190 --> 05:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:42:36.548 --> 05:42:36.558 align:start position:0%
30 first year of the session we had a
 
05:42:38.590 --> 05:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
heavy heavy workload last year the
 
05:42:41.070 --> 05:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
second year second year of the term we
 
05:42:43.350 --> 05:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
it was a little bit
 
05:42:46.030 --> 05:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
lighter all right if you folks um are
 
05:42:48.310 --> 05:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
ready uh some of you try to come back
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
put on your uh camera so I know you're
 
05:42:55.350 --> 05:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
there because we're going to be taking
 
05:42:59.868 --> 05:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
up in a minute or so House Bill 2 31
 
05:43:01.948 --> 05:43:01.958 align:start position:0%
relative to workplace location rights
 
05:43:04.750 --> 05:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure uh representative
 
05:43:07.110 --> 05:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
Warden are you with
 
05:43:10.310 --> 05:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
us all right all right if we're all
 
05:43:12.150 --> 05:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
ready to go I'm going to reopen
 
05:43:15.390 --> 05:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
reconvene the uh executive committee I'm
 
05:43:19.270 --> 05:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
going to call recognize representative
 
05:43:23.548 --> 05:43:23.558 align:start position:0%
kahill for a motion on House Bill
 
05:43:27.230 --> 05:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
231 uh thank you Mr chairman on House
 
05:43:27.240 --> 05:43:28.030 align:start position:0%
231 uh thank you Mr chairman on House
Bill

05:43:28.030 --> 05:43:28.040 align:start position:0%

05:43:28.040 --> 05:43:29.548 align:start position:0%
Bill
231

05:43:29.548 --> 05:43:29.558 align:start position:0%
231
 
05:43:33.270 --> 05:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
I'm moving itl and with some regret I I
 
05:43:34.990 --> 05:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
know that the uh woman who brought this
 
05:43:37.270 --> 05:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
forward to us Kate Fredericks has worked
 
05:43:39.430 --> 05:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
on this for several years but I think
 
05:43:42.430 --> 05:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
that the uh bill and the Senate will
 
05:43:44.708 --> 05:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
have much better chance of passing and
 
05:43:46.510 --> 05:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
accomplishing much of what she wants to
 
05:43:53.110 --> 05:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
do and so I uh am moving uh to itl on
 
05:43:57.510 --> 05:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
231 motion is made by Gill seconded by
 
05:43:58.750 --> 05:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth do you want to
 
05:44:00.190 --> 05:44:00.200 align:start position:0%

05:44:03.230 --> 05:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
now representative kale you kind of did
 
05:44:04.990 --> 05:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I got ahead of myself that's
 
05:44:07.948 --> 05:44:07.958 align:start position:0%
okay that's all right um anyone else
 
05:44:10.868 --> 05:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
like to speak in the L on
 
05:44:14.150 --> 05:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
this anyone
 
05:44:16.590 --> 05:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
online this is will infantine I'll just
 
05:44:18.310 --> 05:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh mention I did receive a call from the
 
05:44:20.310 --> 05:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
senator who sponsored the other bills
 
05:44:23.830 --> 05:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
and and the other um and uh I had a chat
 
05:44:27.150 --> 05:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
with her and she said the uh um she felt
 
05:44:30.468 --> 05:44:30.478 align:start position:0%
that the other bills had been worked by
 
05:44:33.030 --> 05:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh many other groups uh and a consensus
 
05:44:35.628 --> 05:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
had been made um I agree with you no
 
05:44:37.788 --> 05:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
disrespect um to the woman that spoke
 
05:44:41.230 --> 05:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
very eloquently uh in front of us in her
 
05:44:44.110 --> 05:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
ordeal uh her ordeal while I'm sorry she
 
05:44:47.590 --> 05:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
had to deal with that has probably made
 
05:44:51.468 --> 05:44:51.478 align:start position:0%
uh all future situations regarding this
 
05:44:54.230 --> 05:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
um better for everybody so we're not
 
05:44:57.628 --> 05:44:57.638 align:start position:0%
dismissing her at all by iing this bill
 
05:45:00.230 --> 05:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
05:45:02.390 --> 05:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to mention that I I
 
05:45:04.548 --> 05:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
received a call from um that same woman
 
05:45:07.390 --> 05:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
I'm forgetting her name um but
 
05:45:11.190 --> 05:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
um the uh what I encouraged her to do is
 
05:45:13.670 --> 05:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
get together with this the major
 
05:45:16.708 --> 05:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um that that have worked on
 
05:45:18.670 --> 05:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
the the Senate bill and if she has
 
05:45:20.910 --> 05:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
concerns about the Senate Bill work with
 
05:45:26.430 --> 05:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
them to come up with uh uh Solutions um
 
05:45:28.270 --> 05:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
but don't ask us to combine two bills
 
05:45:32.390 --> 05:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
because we'll just screw it up um so um
 
05:45:34.830 --> 05:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
the um I'm hopeful that that they will
 
05:45:37.510 --> 05:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
do that and if there are um improvements
 
05:45:38.948 --> 05:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
that can be made in the Senate bill that
 
05:45:42.110 --> 05:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
they be made before they uh well maybe
 
05:45:45.430 --> 05:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
when they come to us um but um at any
 
05:45:45.440 --> 05:45:46.830 align:start position:0%
when they come to us um but um at any
rate

05:45:46.830 --> 05:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
rate
 
05:45:49.590 --> 05:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully we'll get a bill passed on
 
05:45:51.868 --> 05:45:51.878 align:start position:0%
this I think it's a very worthy
 
05:45:54.430 --> 05:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
cause agreed any further questions
 
05:45:59.230 --> 05:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
online on Zoom seeing no hands in the
 
05:46:02.230 --> 05:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
committee room the motion on the floor
 
05:46:05.150 --> 05:46:05.160 align:start position:0%

05:47:29.430 --> 05:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
quickly in the consent agenda however

[Music]
 
05:47:35.750 --> 05:47:35.760 align:start position:0%

issue uh that is up to everyone to make

it if they would like that I just don't
 
05:47:47.510 --> 05:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
think it should go on a consent agenda
 
05:47:49.230 --> 05:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
at least should be stated that this uh
 
05:47:52.468 --> 05:47:52.478 align:start position:0%
issue is being uh dealt with through a
 
05:47:52.478 --> 05:47:53.548 align:start position:0%

motion uh thank you Mr chairman um much
 
05:49:09.788 --> 05:49:09.798 align:start position:0%
like many of these minimum uh minimum
 
05:49:11.548 --> 05:49:11.558 align:start position:0%
hourly rate bills that we've done over
 
05:49:15.030 --> 05:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
the past many many years uh pretty much
 
05:49:15.040 --> 05:49:17.310 align:start position:0%
the past many many years uh pretty much
the

05:49:17.310 --> 05:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:20.670 --> 05:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
same same arguments I'll put forward
 
05:49:25.510 --> 05:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
against them uh against the uh 22 2250
 
05:49:29.270 --> 05:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
per hour wage that this one calls
 
05:49:29.280 --> 05:49:31.510 align:start position:0%
per hour wage that this one calls
for

05:49:31.510 --> 05:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:49:35.110 --> 05:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
um primarily there's always this and I
 
05:49:36.868 --> 05:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
find it's not with just the minimum wage
 
05:49:39.628 --> 05:49:39.638 align:start position:0%
bills but many other types of similar
 
05:49:42.750 --> 05:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
bills like this there's always the
 
05:49:46.990 --> 05:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
desire to insert ourselves politicians
 
05:49:50.030 --> 05:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
Andor bureaucrats in between the
 
05:49:52.310 --> 05:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
employer and the
 
05:49:54.948 --> 05:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
employee uh and basically when we do
 
05:49:56.750 --> 05:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
that we just muck up the relationship
 
05:49:59.468 --> 05:49:59.478 align:start position:0%
that exists there that was with an
 
05:49:59.478 --> 05:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
that exists there that was with an
M

05:50:02.480 --> 05:50:02.490 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:02.490 --> 05:50:05.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:50:05.070 --> 05:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:50:09.150 --> 05:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
um just for clarification
 
05:50:09.160 --> 05:50:10.830 align:start position:0%
um just for clarification
cl

05:50:10.830 --> 05:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
cl
 
05:50:13.910 --> 05:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
to we we had several businesses and
 
05:50:15.990 --> 05:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
associations who have testified to this
 
05:50:19.590 --> 05:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
bill uh specifically and to many others
 
05:50:21.590 --> 05:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh about the ne negative effects of
 
05:50:26.350 --> 05:50:26.360 align:start position:0%
going uh up to a 2250 an hour uh minimum
 
05:50:30.150 --> 05:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
wage and I I must of course agree with
 
05:50:34.030 --> 05:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
that um today's wag is out there in the
 
05:50:36.750 --> 05:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
in the in the free market where supply
 
05:50:39.628 --> 05:50:39.638 align:start position:0%
and demand determines what a individual
 
05:50:39.638 --> 05:50:40.548 align:start position:0%
and demand determines what a individual
is

05:50:40.548 --> 05:50:40.558 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:50:43.190 --> 05:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
worth um
 
05:50:46.750 --> 05:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
produces wag is far above uh even a
 
05:50:49.310 --> 05:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
couple years ago my local Wendy's down
 
05:50:54.948 --> 05:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
at the traffic circle in Lee has sign
 
05:50:59.190 --> 05:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
up part-time $12 an hour to start part
 
05:51:02.990 --> 05:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
time um everybody's favorite Whipping
 
05:51:05.670 --> 05:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
Boy or whipping horse or whatever you
 
05:51:07.868 --> 05:51:07.878 align:start position:0%
want to call it Walmart even they they
 
05:51:11.150 --> 05:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
recently raised their starting wage to
 
05:51:14.390 --> 05:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
12 for part-time they at their uh they
 
05:51:17.910 --> 05:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
range for their hourly now 12 to $25 an
 
05:51:21.548 --> 05:51:21.558 align:start position:0%
hour and this is a company that
 
05:51:24.270 --> 05:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
employs more individuals in the United
 
05:51:26.510 --> 05:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
States than New Hampshire has
 
05:51:29.468 --> 05:51:29.478 align:start position:0%
citizens 1.5 million jobs that company
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
creates I know everybody loves to hate
 
05:51:34.628 --> 05:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
them but that's a lot of jobs that
 
05:51:37.070 --> 05:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
they're providing to a lot of people
 
05:51:39.948 --> 05:51:39.958 align:start position:0%
that might not even have work
 
05:51:43.670 --> 05:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
without Walmart being around so based on
 
05:51:46.310 --> 05:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
that I I'm a free marketer I believe in
 
05:51:48.270 --> 05:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
letting supply and demand deter
 
05:51:50.310 --> 05:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
determine what an employee is worth and
 
05:51:53.390 --> 05:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
letting the business and the employee
 
05:51:56.628 --> 05:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
determine uh that Arrangement so I I
 
05:51:59.070 --> 05:51:59.080 align:start position:0%
recommend against that or I in favor of
 
05:52:02.150 --> 05:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
the itl motion thank you very much Mr
 
05:52:04.628 --> 05:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
turot I have a few hands up I'll get to
 
05:52:07.110 --> 05:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
everyone represent
 
05:52:09.190 --> 05:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
Adent thank you Mr
 
05:52:12.868 --> 05:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'm Gonna Save as much of my
 
05:52:15.150 --> 05:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
powder as possible for the $5 an hour
 
05:52:17.510 --> 05:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill um I think that one's better
 
05:52:20.590 --> 05:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
structured um it's got a phase in period
 
05:52:22.468 --> 05:52:22.478 align:start position:0%
it's more closely aligned federal
 
05:52:27.468 --> 05:52:27.478 align:start position:0%
minimum wage uh potential increase um I
 
05:52:29.150 --> 05:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
don't know what the process a budget
 
05:52:30.430 --> 05:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
reconciliation is going to look like
 
05:52:32.110 --> 05:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
when it goes to the Senate it survived
 
05:52:36.628 --> 05:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
in the house but who knows um I my
 
05:52:38.390 --> 05:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
problems with this bill are just the
 
05:52:41.708 --> 05:52:41.718 align:start position:0%
dramatic increase um with
 
05:52:47.070 --> 05:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
no um no phas in Period um even the
 
05:52:49.350 --> 05:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
example that I mentioned the other week
 
05:52:54.190 --> 05:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
um where Florida took the large step of
 
05:52:57.788 --> 05:52:57.798 align:start position:0%
doubling theirs from $8 an hour to
 
05:53:02.190 --> 05:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
almost or $25 an hour uh still period
 
05:53:06.110 --> 05:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
there and it's still only up um so it's
 
05:53:09.750 --> 05:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
not that I don't support folks making
 
05:53:12.190 --> 05:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
2250 I think that's you know pretty
 
05:53:14.948 --> 05:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
close to what someone would need to uh
 
05:53:18.788 --> 05:53:18.798 align:start position:0%
survive in certain areas um I think 15
 
05:53:19.910 --> 05:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
is a good
 
05:53:22.750 --> 05:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
floor um that's what I'm going to argue
 
05:53:25.628 --> 05:53:25.638 align:start position:0%
for um so I'm going to end up voting
 
05:53:29.030 --> 05:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
against this today um and I look forward
 
05:53:32.070 --> 05:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
to seeing um when 15 gets scheduled
 
05:53:35.548 --> 05:53:35.558 align:start position:0%
depending on what happens in DC um and I
 
05:53:36.670 --> 05:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
have just
 
05:53:41.150 --> 05:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:44.590 --> 05:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
one thank you any other comments here in
 
05:53:44.600 --> 05:53:47.350 align:start position:0%
one thank you any other comments here in
the

05:53:47.350 --> 05:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:49.830 --> 05:53:49.840 align:start position:0%

05:53:53.788 --> 05:53:53.798 align:start position:0%

was unmuted I muted myself I I don't
 
05:54:10.510 --> 05:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
know uh you you brought up the MIT wage
 
05:54:12.948 --> 05:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
calculator and if you really looked at
 
05:54:15.310 --> 05:54:15.320 align:start position:0%
that closely you probably could find out
 
05:54:18.830 --> 05:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
that in nasua the wage calculator thinks
 
05:54:20.830 --> 05:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
that you can find a studio apartment for
 
05:54:23.510 --> 05:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
a single person for
 
05:54:27.070 --> 05:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
$1,082 a year that's
 
05:54:31.628 --> 05:54:31.638 align:start position:0%
$840 and if you can find anything I mean
 
05:54:34.670 --> 05:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
maybe a garage Loft with no heat it
 
05:54:36.110 --> 05:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
might be
 
05:54:39.030 --> 05:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
$800 but there you go I just wantan to I
 
05:54:40.468 --> 05:54:40.478 align:start position:0%
just want to make it clear that no
 
05:54:42.468 --> 05:54:42.478 align:start position:0%
matter what you're saying about minimum
 
05:54:45.270 --> 05:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
wage it really should keep Pace with the
 
05:54:48.670 --> 05:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
rest of society or cities like Nash are
 
05:54:50.230 --> 05:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay more into their
 
05:54:53.350 --> 05:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
welfare department more into their souit
 
05:54:56.230 --> 05:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
kitchen and this is a discussion that we
 
05:54:58.270 --> 05:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
need to have it really is and by by the
 
05:55:00.868 --> 05:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
way Walmart is the largest employer in
 
05:55:03.190 --> 05:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and if we're
 
05:55:07.788 --> 05:55:07.798 align:start position:0%
paying the most employees around $12
 
05:55:10.070 --> 05:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's hurting the economy because those
 
05:55:11.910 --> 05:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
people can't go out and buy shoes for
 
05:55:15.910 --> 05:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
their kids or go to the restaurant and
 
05:55:17.830 --> 05:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
enjoy themselves and be part of the
 
05:55:20.510 --> 05:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
community and I don't know we really
 
05:55:22.788 --> 05:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
need to do something because we're going
 
05:55:24.788 --> 05:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
backwards with this and I'll stop
 
05:55:26.990 --> 05:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
talking there thanks very
 
05:55:29.948 --> 05:55:29.958 align:start position:0%
much thank you repr SM representative
 
05:55:33.030 --> 05:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
kahill uh thank you Mr chairman while I
 
05:55:35.990 --> 05:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
while I don't support the 2250 I do
 
05:55:38.230 --> 05:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
think that uh that's probably pretty
 
05:55:39.670 --> 05:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
close to what a person would need to
 
05:55:41.468 --> 05:55:41.478 align:start position:0%
survive you know on their own and
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
without a roommate and or or a partner
 
05:55:47.430 --> 05:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
to share expenses uh I don't think we
 
05:55:50.590 --> 05:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
can find an $800 apartment in New Market
 
05:55:53.310 --> 05:55:53.320 align:start position:0%
either um
 
05:55:55.670 --> 05:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
but when I'm thinking back to you know
 
05:55:57.230 --> 05:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
to Walmart now they know that they're
 
05:55:58.990 --> 05:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
big employer and people go there because
 
05:56:01.230 --> 05:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
it's cheaper but do you remember how
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
many small businesses there were
 
05:56:05.190 --> 05:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
providing these products and services
 
05:56:07.310 --> 05:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
before Walmart became this
 
05:56:09.548 --> 05:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
Behemoth I think those are a lot of jobs
 
05:56:12.070 --> 05:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
that were there and having them all
 
05:56:14.190 --> 05:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
conglomerated into one place isn't
 
05:56:16.270 --> 05:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily a good thing for our economy
 
05:56:19.150 --> 05:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:21.468 --> 05:56:21.478 align:start position:0%
country thank you representative kahill
 
05:56:23.868 --> 05:56:23.878 align:start position:0%

05:56:27.628 --> 05:56:27.638 align:start position:0%

frankly because I don't know if I've
 
05:58:11.150 --> 05:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
made a mistake
 
05:58:11.160 --> 05:58:16.788 align:start position:0%
made a mistake
here

05:58:16.788 --> 05:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:19.150 --> 05:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
um uh for the next bill I'll save that
 
05:58:20.548 --> 05:58:20.558 align:start position:0%
mistake for the next bill the next bill
 
05:58:23.628 --> 05:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
in F in uh before is House Bill 501
 
05:58:25.190 --> 05:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
establishing a minimum pay rate for
 
05:58:26.750 --> 05:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
adjunct facilities of the University
 
05:58:28.590 --> 05:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
system and community college system of
 
05:58:30.830 --> 05:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we had a hearing on this
 
05:58:34.190 --> 05:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
bill uh we were ready to execute today a
 
05:58:38.190 --> 05:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
major amendment has been provided to us
 
05:58:40.868 --> 05:58:40.878 align:start position:0%
uh was my the opinion of the uh chairman
 
05:58:42.548 --> 05:58:42.558 align:start position:0%
and the vice chairman that it was so
 
05:58:44.230 --> 05:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
significant a change that it should have
 
05:58:46.910 --> 05:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
a hearing so we are not going to be
 
05:58:50.510 --> 05:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
executing House Bill 501 today until we
 
05:58:52.830 --> 05:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
can at least have a hearing on on that
 
05:58:55.030 --> 05:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment it basically stripped out the
 
05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
entire Bill and came up with a new
 
05:58:56.638 --> 05:58:58.948 align:start position:0%
entire Bill and came up with a new
paragraph

05:58:58.948 --> 05:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
05:58:58.958 --> 05:59:01.390 align:start position:0%
paragraph
any

05:59:01.390 --> 05:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:04.070 --> 05:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
objection okay the next one could be a
 
05:59:05.670 --> 05:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
mistake on my
 
05:59:11.030 --> 05:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
part we have House Bill 385 FN it was my
 
05:59:13.468 --> 05:59:13.478 align:start position:0%
intention of calling representative Susi
 
05:59:14.548 --> 05:59:14.558 align:start position:0%
for a
 
05:59:16.830 --> 05:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
motion um and I just want to make sure I
 
05:59:19.468 --> 05:59:19.478 align:start position:0%
can do this correctly I apologize for
 
05:59:21.788 --> 05:59:21.798 align:start position:0%
not giving you advanced warning we have
 
05:59:21.798 --> 05:59:24.070 align:start position:0%
not giving you advanced warning we have
an

05:59:24.070 --> 05:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:31.030 --> 05:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:31.040 --> 05:59:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
which

05:59:33.030 --> 05:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:59:36.910 --> 05:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
is 2021 -03
 
05:59:41.948 --> 05:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
07h but parliamentary wise this uh I
 
05:59:43.628 --> 05:59:43.638 align:start position:0%
don't remember guys so we got to refresh
 
05:59:45.190 --> 05:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
my memory if I'm doing this correctly
 
05:59:46.708 --> 05:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
this was submitted by representative
 
05:59:50.590 --> 05:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
Pearson the um Prime
 
05:59:55.150 --> 05:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor are we able to have a
 
06:00:01.230 --> 06:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
representative move that even though
 
06:00:04.350 --> 06:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment is not in his
 
06:00:10.510 --> 06:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
name my opinion is yes um that because
 
06:00:13.270 --> 06:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
we have the amendment number that after
 
06:00:13.280 --> 06:00:14.390 align:start position:0%
we have the amendment number that after
the

06:00:14.390 --> 06:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:00:17.708 --> 06:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
fact if it gets adopted by the committee
 
06:00:20.830 --> 06:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
then it gets redrafted as the committee
 
06:00:22.070 --> 06:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's true we did that the
 
06:00:24.070 --> 06:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
first correct we did that the first one
 
06:00:26.628 --> 06:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
today with House Bill 258 we didn't have
 
06:00:29.350 --> 06:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
him so all right so sorry thank you for
 
06:00:32.350 --> 06:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
letting me uh you know think out loud
 
06:00:34.468 --> 06:00:34.478 align:start position:0%
there uh representative Susi if you're
 
06:00:37.230 --> 06:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
willing to make a motion on uh House
 
06:00:39.788 --> 06:00:39.798 align:start position:0%
Bill 385
 
06:00:42.868 --> 06:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
FN I will do so I just have one question
 
06:00:46.948 --> 06:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
of the chair yes seeing the bill I I
 
06:00:48.910 --> 06:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
don't believe that it was stated in the
 
06:00:50.750 --> 06:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
calendar that we were executing that
 
06:00:53.788 --> 06:00:53.798 align:start position:0%
today um is that going to be an
 
06:00:59.270 --> 06:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
issue it um it was not and I had emailed
 
06:01:02.670 --> 06:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
everyone about 385 FN and 590 FN that
 
06:01:07.708 --> 06:01:07.718 align:start position:0%
they would be executing and um our um
 
06:01:10.500 --> 06:01:10.510 align:start position:0%
calendar uh does State
 
06:01:10.510 --> 06:01:13.070 align:start position:0%
calendar uh does State
[Music]

06:01:13.070 --> 06:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:01:16.590 --> 06:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
um I was told I got to make sure it does
 
06:01:16.600 --> 06:01:21.190 align:start position:0%
um I was told I got to make sure it does
State

06:01:21.190 --> 06:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:23.910 --> 06:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
um chairman executive session on pending
 
06:01:25.350 --> 06:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
legislation may be held throughout the
 
06:01:26.868 --> 06:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
day time permitting from the timeing
 
06:01:29.190 --> 06:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
committee is in initially convened is is
 
06:01:32.350 --> 06:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
the uh was my understanding the clerk
 
06:01:33.910 --> 06:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
has acknowledged that that is sufficient
 
06:01:35.948 --> 06:01:35.958 align:start position:0%
to bring forth other piece of
 
06:01:38.590 --> 06:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
legislation I will also tell you if if
 
06:01:41.230 --> 06:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
folks do not want to hear the those two
 
06:01:43.990 --> 06:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
bills today they may automatically die
 
06:01:46.070 --> 06:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
because they have to be out by noon on
 
06:01:48.070 --> 06:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
the 18th and we are not scheduled to
 
06:01:50.390 --> 06:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
meet between now and the
 
06:01:54.030 --> 06:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
18th so I believe we have made all the
 
06:01:57.110 --> 06:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate um measures but I have a
 
06:01:58.628 --> 06:01:58.638 align:start position:0%
question of the chair from
 
06:02:01.868 --> 06:02:01.878 align:start position:0%
representative turot inquiry Mr chairman
 
06:02:05.948 --> 06:02:05.958 align:start position:0%
yes um I I don't really honestly care
 
06:02:08.110 --> 06:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
which way we go on this on whether we
 
06:02:10.270 --> 06:02:10.280 align:start position:0%
hear it or not I want to be sure that we
 
06:02:13.548 --> 06:02:13.558 align:start position:0%
are following um is what is in the
 
06:02:17.030 --> 06:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
calendar does that give the public the
 
06:02:17.040 --> 06:02:18.788 align:start position:0%
calendar does that give the public the
required

06:02:18.788 --> 06:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
required
 
06:02:21.230 --> 06:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
notice that they are supposed to receive
 
06:02:24.350 --> 06:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's my only question
 
06:02:27.750 --> 06:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
Point uh I am happy to do what majority
 
06:02:29.070 --> 06:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee would
 
06:02:32.230 --> 06:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
like uh under the understanding that
 
06:02:34.628 --> 06:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
maybe not the house bill 385 because I I
 
06:02:36.110 --> 06:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
don't know why I'm getting this but I've
 
06:02:39.310 --> 06:02:39.320 align:start position:0%
been told that 590 must be out 385
 
06:02:42.390 --> 06:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't even though they're both FNS
 
06:02:44.628 --> 06:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
don't know why I I don't want to push
 
06:02:47.670 --> 06:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
that luck and I would like to hear both
 
06:02:50.750 --> 06:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
um based on what I have been told uh but
 
06:02:54.190 --> 06:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
this is the speaker a the Aaron goule
 
06:02:55.910 --> 06:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
because the sentence I
 
06:02:58.510 --> 06:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
read and because I notified each one of
 
06:03:01.270 --> 06:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
the members of the assoc of the uh
 
06:03:06.190 --> 06:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
committee that we can have that I am not
 
06:03:08.310 --> 06:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
above committee
 
06:03:08.320 --> 06:03:09.510 align:start position:0%
above committee
[Music]

06:03:09.510 --> 06:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:03:12.270 --> 06:03:12.280 align:start position:0%
um uh wanting to rule otherwise I see a
 
06:03:14.548 --> 06:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
couple hands I'm going to so that my
 
06:03:16.150 --> 06:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
answer to your question representative
 
06:03:18.390 --> 06:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
turkot uh since I did give notice to all
 
06:03:20.670 --> 06:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
the members and because that blurb is in
 
06:03:20.680 --> 06:03:23.190 align:start position:0%
the members and because that blurb is in
there

06:03:23.190 --> 06:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:03:26.628 --> 06:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
um I can get a ruling from this I can
 
06:03:28.110 --> 06:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
get a ruling from from the clerk house
 
06:03:32.030 --> 06:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
clerk again I I really don't care I just
 
06:03:35.750 --> 06:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
want to make sure what you're doing
 
06:03:39.830 --> 06:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
is accordance with public notice not
 
06:03:41.628 --> 06:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
notice requirements and all that that's
 
06:03:44.110 --> 06:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
my only Point as do I representative
 
06:03:45.310 --> 06:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
kahill you had your hand and then
 
06:03:47.670 --> 06:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative Smith yes uh thank you Mr
 
06:03:49.788 --> 06:03:49.798 align:start position:0%
chair and I while I know that this is
 
06:03:52.708 --> 06:03:52.718 align:start position:0%
not our normal practice to exact bills
 
06:03:55.030 --> 06:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
without you know an interval in between
 
06:03:56.830 --> 06:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
I you've you've articulated that the
 
06:04:00.110 --> 06:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
reason behind it and the fact that these
 
06:04:02.510 --> 06:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
bills you know will be delayed and won
 
06:04:05.350 --> 06:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
you know need to be out and the uh the
 
06:04:08.190 --> 06:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
dis the standard disclaimer that
 
06:04:10.030 --> 06:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
executive session may follow I believe
 
06:04:12.390 --> 06:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
covers the concerns of my friend
 
06:04:12.400 --> 06:04:13.948 align:start position:0%
covers the concerns of my friend
representative

06:04:13.948 --> 06:04:13.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:04:16.030 --> 06:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
turkot representative
 
06:04:18.310 --> 06:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
Smith that's exactly correct we've been
 
06:04:19.788 --> 06:04:19.798 align:start position:0%
doing it that way for the last couple of
 
06:04:22.628 --> 06:04:22.638 align:start position:0%
sessions that that little blurb tells us
 
06:04:24.670 --> 06:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
that we can at any point in time once
 
06:04:27.390 --> 06:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
it's been um at a hearing once once it's
 
06:04:29.708 --> 06:04:29.718 align:start position:0%
been at a hearing we can do it at any
 
06:04:31.708 --> 06:04:31.718 align:start position:0%
time we like and since it's already had
 
06:04:33.830 --> 06:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
its hearing this one can go
 
06:04:36.548 --> 06:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
ahead okay thank you both of you um out
 
06:04:40.430 --> 06:04:40.440 align:start position:0%

06:04:50.788 --> 06:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:52.948 --> 06:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
point I believe the outcome is going to
 
06:04:55.990 --> 06:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
be a positive uh so for the one the ones
 
06:04:57.548 --> 06:04:57.558 align:start position:0%

d307h thank you Mr chairman so I think
 
06:06:12.110 --> 06:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
the public hearing I think there some of
 
06:06:13.948 --> 06:06:13.958 align:start position:0%
the I think the water got muddied a
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
little bit I think there were some
 
06:06:17.230 --> 06:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
things that were said in there about uh
 
06:06:19.830 --> 06:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
the death benefit this and that I took
 
06:06:22.390 --> 06:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and I talked to
 
06:06:25.150 --> 06:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
um Deputy Commissioner Ogden I've made
 
06:06:26.548 --> 06:06:26.558 align:start position:0%
some phone calls I talked to you Mr
 
06:06:26.558 --> 06:06:27.548 align:start position:0%
some phone calls I talked to you Mr
chair

06:06:27.548 --> 06:06:27.558 align:start position:0%
chair
 
06:06:30.548 --> 06:06:30.558 align:start position:0%
um in in a nutshell this bill is pretty
 
06:06:30.558 --> 06:06:32.468 align:start position:0%
um in in a nutshell this bill is pretty
simple

06:06:32.468 --> 06:06:32.478 align:start position:0%
simple
 
06:06:36.548 --> 06:06:36.558 align:start position:0%
um we're going to move that age of 65 to
 
06:06:40.150 --> 06:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
70 based on some of the um what we heard
 
06:06:42.230 --> 06:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing that day and I
 
06:06:44.110 --> 06:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
think some of the confusion comes
 
06:06:46.468 --> 06:06:46.478 align:start position:0%
in understandably understand this there
 
06:06:48.830 --> 06:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
are a lot of people that are working um
 
06:06:48.840 --> 06:06:50.548 align:start position:0%
are a lot of people that are working um
longer

06:06:50.548 --> 06:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
longer
 
06:06:52.990 --> 06:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
today that section c is going to change
 
06:06:55.788 --> 06:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
the age to 70 if you look right above in
 
06:06:58.150 --> 06:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
in the law I don't have
 
06:07:00.990 --> 06:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
um but in section B it says that at the
 
06:07:02.390 --> 06:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
time of somebody's retirement the
 
06:07:05.150 --> 06:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
benefits would expire five years after
 
06:07:07.990 --> 06:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
that uh his or her 65th
 
06:07:12.750 --> 06:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
birthday knowing that I think um former
 
06:07:14.230 --> 06:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
um representative horn when he
 
06:07:16.510 --> 06:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
originally put the bill in
 
06:07:20.350 --> 06:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
um wanted to move that age to unlimited
 
06:07:23.590 --> 06:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think we can go unlimited um
 
06:07:27.150 --> 06:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
however that fiveyear window comes into
 
06:07:29.390 --> 06:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
a lot for people that may work we may
 
06:07:31.910 --> 06:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
have firefighters at work till 62 or 63
 
06:07:34.708 --> 06:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
years old and my question was to Mr
 
06:07:37.390 --> 06:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
Ogden as to whether or not that fiveyear
 
06:07:39.070 --> 06:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
window would really only give these
 
06:07:42.430 --> 06:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
folks um two or three years to P um
 
06:07:45.788 --> 06:07:45.798 align:start position:0%
pursue a what we call um an occupational
 
06:07:48.190 --> 06:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
health injury I don't think it doesn't
 
06:07:50.030 --> 06:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
change anything else in the bill what
 
06:07:51.830 --> 06:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's doing is it just changed that age
 
06:07:55.750 --> 06:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
of 65 to 70 um and that pretty much in a
 
06:07:57.390 --> 06:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
nutshell I'll try to answer question if
 
06:07:57.400 --> 06:07:58.310 align:start position:0%
nutshell I'll try to answer question if
people

06:07:58.310 --> 06:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:08:01.788 --> 06:08:01.798 align:start position:0%
ask thank you Mr chairman thank you do
 
06:08:03.468 --> 06:08:03.478 align:start position:0%
we have anyone else that would like to
 
06:08:08.948 --> 06:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:12.670 --> 06:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
Zoom not see any anyone in the lob like
 
06:08:12.680 --> 06:08:13.670 align:start position:0%
Zoom not see any anyone in the lob like
to

06:08:13.670 --> 06:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:08:16.830 --> 06:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
speak representative turkot thank you Mr
 
06:08:16.840 --> 06:08:18.350 align:start position:0%
speak representative turkot thank you Mr
chairman

06:08:18.350 --> 06:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:08:20.070 --> 06:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
um I
 
06:08:23.350 --> 06:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
believe we were together when this first
 
06:08:25.510 --> 06:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
passed few sessions ago when it was
 
06:08:29.948 --> 06:08:29.958 align:start position:0%
first put into the that is correct um
 
06:08:33.190 --> 06:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
into the rsas and I believe at the time
 
06:08:35.548 --> 06:08:35.558 align:start position:0%
I was probably for I honestly don't
 
06:08:35.558 --> 06:08:37.230 align:start position:0%
I was probably for I honestly don't
recall

06:08:37.230 --> 06:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
recall
 
06:08:41.110 --> 06:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm not opposed to the concept of
 
06:08:44.430 --> 06:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
what's going on here my my concern is
 
06:08:47.030 --> 06:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason why I will vote
 
06:08:50.590 --> 06:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
against it not because of what it is but
 
06:08:54.310 --> 06:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
I I don't like the potential for uh the
 
06:08:57.270 --> 06:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
creep of the aid
 
06:09:00.110 --> 06:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
um I mean originally the original Bill
 
06:09:05.350 --> 06:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
took out any uh length of time and now
 
06:09:08.468 --> 06:09:08.478 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh been you know moved up to
 
06:09:11.670 --> 06:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
five years my strong concern and worry
 
06:09:13.910 --> 06:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
is in next term we'll be coming back and
 
06:09:15.910 --> 06:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
it'll be another five years and another
 
06:09:18.750 --> 06:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
five years and another five years so
 
06:09:21.350 --> 06:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's my only concern again the concept
 
06:09:23.110 --> 06:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
I was here when it went in I was fine
 
06:09:27.190 --> 06:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
with it I do have concerns about age cre
 
06:09:29.990 --> 06:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
in the Bill thank you Mr chairman very
 
06:09:33.708 --> 06:09:33.718 align:start position:0%

I just have another you know because of
 
06:09:51.750 --> 06:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
this question of age grp I I've heard
 
06:09:53.910 --> 06:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
now I'm hoping this can be retroactive
 
06:09:58.948 --> 06:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:01.670 --> 06:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
far you know lifespan and energy and
 
06:10:03.628 --> 06:10:03.638 align:start position:0%
everything and it may be too late for me
 
06:10:05.868 --> 06:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
but I just want to just put that out
 
06:10:09.390 --> 06:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
there thank you representative Hill any
 
06:10:13.270 --> 06:10:13.280 align:start position:0%

because I turned
 
06:10:30.868 --> 06:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:33.548 --> 06:10:33.558 align:start position:0%
that sorry I called you representative
 
06:10:35.510 --> 06:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
herel versus representative n Mr
 
06:10:37.830 --> 06:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I get called a
 
06:10:42.750 --> 06:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
lot trust me sure we all do no
 
06:10:45.948 --> 06:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
problem um I don't see any other I would
 
06:10:48.750 --> 06:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
like to just briefly speak um I do
 
06:10:50.868 --> 06:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
recall representative turot when this
 
06:10:54.350 --> 06:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
bill first came up and um understand we
 
06:10:57.670 --> 06:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
talked about a carve out earlier
 
06:11:02.110 --> 06:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:06.030 --> 06:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
um the skiers or the the the instructors
 
06:11:09.070 --> 06:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
this is another carb Val no other
 
06:11:12.230 --> 06:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
industry is allowed to have a
 
06:11:16.030 --> 06:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
retroactive or post uh injury Workers
 
06:11:18.430 --> 06:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
Compensation Plan you must be injured
 
06:11:20.750 --> 06:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
while at work you retire
 
06:11:23.910 --> 06:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
today that's it if you got hurt last
 
06:11:25.830 --> 06:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
week you better tell about it last week
 
06:11:28.670 --> 06:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
because you retired today and it it's it
 
06:11:30.390 --> 06:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay so we have carved out something
 
06:11:32.270 --> 06:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
specific for the firefighters now
 
06:11:35.468 --> 06:11:35.478 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a genius uh you know it's
 
06:11:39.390 --> 06:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
pretty logical as Spock would say to um
 
06:11:40.990 --> 06:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
assume that someone who goes into
 
06:11:43.510 --> 06:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
burning buildings for 20 25 years of
 
06:11:46.150 --> 06:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
their career has a higher propensity to
 
06:11:49.830 --> 06:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
get lung type diseases or lung cancer so
 
06:11:52.590 --> 06:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
this carve out was made I believe the
 
06:11:54.750 --> 06:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
intent when this was because this was
 
06:11:57.390 --> 06:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
much bigger much more complex as you
 
06:11:59.150 --> 06:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
remember or turot brought down to
 
06:12:03.350 --> 06:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
something very specific um and um I
 
06:12:05.990 --> 06:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
think the intent was that the 65 may
 
06:12:07.628 --> 06:12:07.638 align:start position:0%
have covered you know everybody up to
 
06:12:10.350 --> 06:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
either age of Medicare or Medicaid or it
 
06:12:11.670 --> 06:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
was going to be plenty enough because a
 
06:12:13.628 --> 06:12:13.638 align:start position:0%
lot of these guys were retiring at 60
 
06:12:15.190 --> 06:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
but the bill technically says five years
 
06:12:17.230 --> 06:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
out of retirement and I will take the
 
06:12:19.030 --> 06:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
Union at their face value that they're
 
06:12:21.510 --> 06:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
telling being accurate that because of
 
06:12:24.548 --> 06:12:24.558 align:start position:0%
new pension reforms meant to elongate
 
06:12:27.868 --> 06:12:27.878 align:start position:0%
their pension plan uh some are starting
 
06:12:29.830 --> 06:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
with a different plan some are starting
 
06:12:33.430 --> 06:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
later some are working later so for
 
06:12:34.788 --> 06:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
someone who's going to be not
 
06:12:38.590 --> 06:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily A A on the on the uh on the
 
06:12:40.750 --> 06:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
truck firefighter who's going into the
 
06:12:44.430 --> 06:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
burning buildings but ones that are now
 
06:12:47.590 --> 06:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh captains District Chiefs Chiefs that
 
06:12:50.150 --> 06:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
could be you know still working albeit
 
06:12:52.590 --> 06:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
not necessarily you know going in the
 
06:12:56.910 --> 06:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
building um that they could work till 5
 
06:12:59.750 --> 06:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
so the 70 was a good compromise which I
 
06:13:01.590 --> 06:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
recommended yeah the hearing didn't go
 
06:13:03.750 --> 06:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
too well it was kind of dis
 
06:13:05.270 --> 06:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about a death benefit
 
06:13:06.788 --> 06:13:06.798 align:start position:0%
there really is no such kind of a thing
 
06:13:09.350 --> 06:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
except when you know a burial type
 
06:13:11.788 --> 06:13:11.798 align:start position:0%
benefit uh if you die for work from a
 
06:13:16.430 --> 06:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
workers um on the job situation but I am
 
06:13:18.310 --> 06:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
too uh I will say this just for the
 
06:13:20.390 --> 06:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
record I too would not want to see
 
06:13:22.708 --> 06:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
anything come up even if I'm retired
 
06:13:24.270 --> 06:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
from this chamber I'd probably come up
 
06:13:26.990 --> 06:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
and testify again saying we made a deal
 
06:13:29.510 --> 06:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
this is what it is we all agreed let's
 
06:13:31.830 --> 06:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
stay with the deal H maybe 10 years from
 
06:13:33.990 --> 06:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
now people are working longer and you
 
06:13:36.270 --> 06:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
know we all find out that the the covid
 
06:13:38.110 --> 06:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine makes us live 20 years longer
 
06:13:41.548 --> 06:13:41.558 align:start position:0%
well hey okay we can look at it so
 
06:13:46.310 --> 06:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's probably way too much so I will
 
06:13:49.030 --> 06:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
quit seeing any other come on guys you
 
06:13:50.230 --> 06:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
know I get anany here I gotta say
 
06:13:52.350 --> 06:13:52.360 align:start position:0%

06:19:21.510 --> 06:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
um at first look uh looking through the
 
06:19:25.468 --> 06:19:25.478 align:start position:0%
bill it's it's obvious this goes well
 
06:19:30.788 --> 06:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
beyond on uh something as simple as paid
 
06:19:33.590 --> 06:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
sick time there's just so much added in
 
06:19:38.548 --> 06:19:38.558 align:start position:0%
here that alone for me uh is enough toh
 
06:19:40.548 --> 06:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
send this to
 
06:19:45.948 --> 06:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
itl however uh much like the minimum
 
06:19:51.990 --> 06:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
wage bills or some of the other P Paid
 
06:19:54.750 --> 06:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
Family Medical Aid
 
06:19:59.270 --> 06:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
bills once again this Bill Gets In
 
06:20:00.868 --> 06:20:00.878 align:start position:0%
Between the
 
06:20:03.788 --> 06:20:03.798 align:start position:0%
employer and the employee the employer
 
06:20:05.190 --> 06:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
and the
 
06:20:08.708 --> 06:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
employee have the ability to make their
 
06:20:12.270 --> 06:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
own uh contracts between them within
 
06:20:13.788 --> 06:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
them between
 
06:20:18.868 --> 06:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
themselves um for the legislature or bu
 
06:20:22.788 --> 06:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats to get in to start mandating
 
06:20:26.670 --> 06:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
laws for sick time for all businesses
 
06:20:28.390 --> 06:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
when one business is going to be
 
06:20:31.510 --> 06:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
definitely different than a uh a small
 
06:20:32.708 --> 06:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
business going to be definitely
 
06:20:35.390 --> 06:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
different than a big business um for us
 
06:20:37.830 --> 06:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
to get involved with that I just think
 
06:20:43.230 --> 06:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
again is is not our our place um sick
 
06:20:46.390 --> 06:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
time vacation time all those things were
 
06:20:49.030 --> 06:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
originally implemented by businesses as
 
06:20:49.040 --> 06:20:49.868 align:start position:0%
originally implemented by businesses as
a

06:20:49.868 --> 06:20:49.878 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:20:54.708 --> 06:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
benefit and now um legislature or some
 
06:20:57.990 --> 06:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
of the legislature want to make that
 
06:21:01.628 --> 06:21:01.638 align:start position:0%
stuff mandatory um and I'm I'm just not
 
06:21:04.830 --> 06:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
in favor that we had many once
 
06:21:08.030 --> 06:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
again individuals who testified against
 
06:21:11.030 --> 06:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
this bill most most who were in the
 
06:21:15.230 --> 06:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
business uh world and one eloquent
 
06:21:16.910 --> 06:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
gentleman who did a really nice job
 
06:21:21.230 --> 06:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
talking about what can happen and what
 
06:21:23.430 --> 06:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
can happen when this is done properly
 
06:21:25.030 --> 06:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
and what happens when it's done
 
06:21:25.040 --> 06:21:26.390 align:start position:0%
and what happens when it's done
improperly

06:21:26.390 --> 06:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
improperly
 
06:21:28.990 --> 06:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
I believe somebody also mentioned during
 
06:21:30.548 --> 06:21:30.558 align:start position:0%
the hearing that the majority of
 
06:21:34.708 --> 06:21:34.718 align:start position:0%
businesses already have um paid sick
 
06:21:37.270 --> 06:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
time and that's again a benefit that's
 
06:21:41.910 --> 06:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
worked out between the employer and
 
06:21:45.548 --> 06:21:45.558 align:start position:0%
employee so I uh rise against this bill
 
06:21:47.468 --> 06:21:47.478 align:start position:0%
and recommend
 
06:21:51.430 --> 06:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
06:21:55.910 --> 06:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman um
 
06:21:58.110 --> 06:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
want to kind of lay out a little bit of
 
06:22:01.628 --> 06:22:01.638 align:start position:0%
background um on why I don't think itl
 
06:22:04.270 --> 06:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
is the right motion
 
06:22:07.590 --> 06:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
um so when we were hearing testimony
 
06:22:10.390 --> 06:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
during public hearing um like the member
 
06:22:13.708 --> 06:22:13.718 align:start position:0%
said uh we heard from
 
06:22:18.590 --> 06:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
businesses that were already doing um a
 
06:22:22.868 --> 06:22:22.878 align:start position:0%
time off uh Pally um and that's well and
 
06:22:26.110 --> 06:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
great um however
 
06:22:27.628 --> 06:22:27.638 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of employees and there
 
06:22:30.350 --> 06:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
are a lot of folks who don't have access
 
06:22:33.430 --> 06:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
to that um I've worked jobs in the past
 
06:22:35.590 --> 06:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
where I haven't had access to that and
 
06:22:38.548 --> 06:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
actually one specific example that kind
 
06:22:41.628 --> 06:22:41.638 align:start position:0%
of radicalized me on this issue was um
 
06:22:45.230 --> 06:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
in 2018 I worked for a rubber Factory
 
06:22:47.430 --> 06:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
and this is a multinational corporation
 
06:22:50.030 --> 06:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
they have the potential and capacity to
 
06:22:52.750 --> 06:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
offer a program like paid sick
 
06:22:57.868 --> 06:22:57.878 align:start position:0%
time I was working third sh one night um
 
06:23:00.390 --> 06:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
and I noticed it was about summer so
 
06:23:02.670 --> 06:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
bubs were around and I noticed all of a
 
06:23:04.788 --> 06:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
sudden my skin started to itch really
 
06:23:07.868 --> 06:23:07.878 align:start position:0%
really bad um just you know had to put
 
06:23:09.750 --> 06:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
down what I was doing just violently
 
06:23:12.070 --> 06:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
scratching my back all over no idea what
 
06:23:14.350 --> 06:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
was going on I felt my throat start to
 
06:23:17.590 --> 06:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
get a little tight and when I looked at
 
06:23:20.830 --> 06:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
my arm I realized it was not a bug b I
 
06:23:23.670 --> 06:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
was breaking out in hives and my throat
 
06:23:27.430 --> 06:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
was closing up and I approached my
 
06:23:30.590 --> 06:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
supervisor asking if I could go to the
 
06:23:34.230 --> 06:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
hospital because I plac barely a high
 
06:23:37.310 --> 06:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
enough premium on my life for that and
 
06:23:41.270 --> 06:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
he said you can go to the hospital but
 
06:23:44.548 --> 06:23:44.558 align:start position:0%
if you leave it will count as one of the
 
06:23:48.070 --> 06:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
three days off that you get a year not
 
06:23:51.310 --> 06:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
paid sick time just three days that you
 
06:23:54.230 --> 06:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
can miss if there is an emergency not
 
06:23:57.670 --> 06:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
rolling literally 38 hour
 
06:23:57.680 --> 06:24:00.150 align:start position:0%
rolling literally 38 hour
sheets

06:24:00.150 --> 06:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
sheets
 
06:24:03.070 --> 06:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
and what bothered me about that I ended
 
06:24:07.590 --> 06:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
up going thankfully um but just the fact
 
06:24:10.510 --> 06:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
that this company that could definitely
 
06:24:13.070 --> 06:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
have just you know wash that away they
 
06:24:18.030 --> 06:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
were fine um put an employee in a
 
06:24:21.548 --> 06:24:21.558 align:start position:0%
position where they were first of all
 
06:24:23.628 --> 06:24:23.638 align:start position:0%
concerned about the longevity of their
 
06:24:27.510 --> 06:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
appointment um but then had to make a
 
06:24:30.788 --> 06:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
decision between getting paid for that
 
06:24:33.830 --> 06:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
evening and living I mean not to be
 
06:24:35.910 --> 06:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
dramatic but I went to the hospital
 
06:24:37.150 --> 06:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
because I was concerned that I was going
 
06:24:39.990 --> 06:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
to die if I didn't get out of whatever
 
06:24:42.070 --> 06:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
was causing that allergic
 
06:24:45.350 --> 06:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
reaction um I'm I'm grateful for the
 
06:24:48.030 --> 06:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
companies that do provide a paid six
 
06:24:51.628 --> 06:24:51.638 align:start position:0%
time benefit um what we're talking about
 
06:24:53.788 --> 06:24:53.798 align:start position:0%
though are generally employees that make
 
06:24:56.948 --> 06:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 8 n $10 an hour they
 
06:24:58.548 --> 06:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
tend to be lower on the
 
06:25:01.990 --> 06:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
rug um we did the math the other week
 
06:25:04.990 --> 06:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
works out to about $640 to
 
06:25:09.670 --> 06:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
$700 um a year per employee um which
 
06:25:13.350 --> 06:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
might sound like a lot were they not
 
06:25:15.270 --> 06:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
just a conversation on the other side of
 
06:25:17.150 --> 06:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
the street where the governor was
 
06:25:20.390 --> 06:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
outlining a plan to scale back the
 
06:25:24.590 --> 06:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax this year um
 
06:25:27.150 --> 06:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
just you know a lot of those folks who
 
06:25:29.390 --> 06:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
don't have access to that pain sick time
 
06:25:30.990 --> 06:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
they're not the permanent managerial
 
06:25:33.150 --> 06:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
class not people who have access to zoom
 
06:25:36.230 --> 06:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
and um can do their jobs remotely they
 
06:25:37.868 --> 06:25:37.878 align:start position:0%
folks that have been you know dealing
 
06:25:40.750 --> 06:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
with the nonsense of the last year in
 
06:25:42.948 --> 06:25:42.958 align:start position:0%
grocery stores really doing front line
 
06:25:44.948 --> 06:25:44.958 align:start position:0%
stuff they're not asking for a lot
 
06:25:46.230 --> 06:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
they're just asking not to get the
 
06:25:48.548 --> 06:25:48.558 align:start position:0%
disease on other people at work because
 
06:25:51.070 --> 06:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
they have to choose between a paycheck
 
06:25:54.230 --> 06:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
the longevity of their job and infecting
 
06:25:56.070 --> 06:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
other people
 
06:25:58.788 --> 06:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
um so I would really love to see this
 
06:26:02.548 --> 06:26:02.558 align:start position:0%
OTP however I'm mature enough to
 
06:26:04.750 --> 06:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
recognize that the votes for that
 
06:26:07.788 --> 06:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
probably don't exist in this room and as
 
06:26:10.110 --> 06:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
the chairman uh said when we had this
 
06:26:11.788 --> 06:26:11.798 align:start position:0%
hearing and he was speaking to
 
06:26:14.590 --> 06:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
representative aler said I'm a
 
06:26:18.190 --> 06:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
republican so I have concerns with some
 
06:26:20.430 --> 06:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
parts of this but I like other parts of
 
06:26:24.150 --> 06:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
this and I would love to see a situation
 
06:26:26.350 --> 06:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
where we took another look at this bill
 
06:26:27.750 --> 06:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
we took out some of the stuff that's
 
06:26:29.030 --> 06:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
obviously not going to pass in a
 
06:26:31.110 --> 06:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
republican majority that's fine but we
 
06:26:33.190 --> 06:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
kept some of the stuff like protections
 
06:26:35.510 --> 06:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
for domestic violence victims or stuff
 
06:26:40.708 --> 06:26:40.718 align:start position:0%
like that so I know it's an ask and I
 
06:26:45.030 --> 06:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
would very much appreciate if the itl
 
06:26:48.070 --> 06:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
motion fails I will immediately make a
 
06:26:49.390 --> 06:26:49.400 align:start position:0%
motion to
 
06:26:53.350 --> 06:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
retain and then I will volunteer to
 
06:26:54.750 --> 06:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
we'll cut out a bunch of the liberal
 
06:26:56.590 --> 06:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
stuff in Bill we'll try to get stuff
 
06:26:58.628 --> 06:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
that we can all agree on and we'll try
 
06:27:01.350 --> 06:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
to move something forward in the house
 
06:27:03.190 --> 06:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
that keeps those domestic violence
 
06:27:04.628 --> 06:27:04.638 align:start position:0%
Protections in there keeps other good
 
06:27:07.150 --> 06:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
stuff in there um so we don't just end
 
06:27:09.430 --> 06:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
up throwing away the good stuff in the
 
06:27:12.190 --> 06:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
bill that the chairman was avert to so
 
06:27:14.350 --> 06:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
that's my ask I'd ask folks to vote
 
06:27:16.948 --> 06:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
against itl and then like I said I'll
 
06:27:19.310 --> 06:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
immediately make a motion for a routine
 
06:27:22.350 --> 06:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
so that we can go through find stuff we
 
06:27:25.670 --> 06:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
all want um I just I think that's the
 
06:27:27.030 --> 06:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
most productive Way Forward because I
 
06:27:29.628 --> 06:27:29.638 align:start position:0%
really don't want to lose that
 
06:27:31.948 --> 06:27:31.958 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your
 
06:27:34.350 --> 06:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
testimony any additional any
 
06:27:37.270 --> 06:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
representatives in the L that would like
 
06:27:37.280 --> 06:27:39.628 align:start position:0%
representatives in the L that would like
to

06:27:39.628 --> 06:27:39.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:42.150 --> 06:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
comment individual members of the
 
06:27:44.548 --> 06:27:44.558 align:start position:0%
committee online show hands if anyone
 
06:27:45.788 --> 06:27:45.798 align:start position:0%
would like
 
06:27:45.798 --> 06:27:48.548 align:start position:0%
would like
to

06:27:48.548 --> 06:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:27:51.230 --> 06:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
speak I have representative Sullivan
 
06:27:54.030 --> 06:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
then representative kill representative
 
06:27:54.040 --> 06:27:59.230 align:start position:0%
then representative kill representative
Sullivan

06:27:59.230 --> 06:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:01.070 --> 06:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
you're still muted uh
 
06:28:04.430 --> 06:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
Brian yeah I know we all did that I'll
 
06:28:08.548 --> 06:28:08.558 align:start position:0%
figure it out um um I was um beginning
 
06:28:10.548 --> 06:28:10.558 align:start position:0%
to say I believe this is a good bill as
 
06:28:12.670 --> 06:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
written um I think it's a reasonable
 
06:28:17.070 --> 06:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
benefit uh not overwhelming um and um I
 
06:28:19.948 --> 06:28:19.958 align:start position:0%
believe it U warrants the uh support of
 
06:28:22.110 --> 06:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
this committee thank
 
06:28:25.468 --> 06:28:25.478 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative kahill
 
06:28:28.110 --> 06:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I would concur
 
06:28:30.150 --> 06:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
with representative Sullivan I I know
 
06:28:32.070 --> 06:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
that we heard from the uh business
 
06:28:33.868 --> 06:28:33.878 align:start position:0%
Community but we also heard from a lot
 
06:28:36.868 --> 06:28:36.878 align:start position:0%
of uh members of the public who just who
 
06:28:38.948 --> 06:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
are working in these jobs without the uh
 
06:28:41.910 --> 06:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
benefit of a sick day and and I think
 
06:28:44.628 --> 06:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
that the uh you know the about that you
 
06:28:47.468 --> 06:28:47.478 align:start position:0%
you know one hour per every 30 worked is
 
06:28:50.868 --> 06:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
is not an unreasonable ask uh in fact we
 
06:28:55.430 --> 06:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
you may be familiar that I I I uh
 
06:28:58.590 --> 06:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
I was quoted in many Publications uh you
 
06:29:00.310 --> 06:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
in response to the question about
 
06:29:03.390 --> 06:29:03.400 align:start position:0%
whether businesses should uh uh could
 
06:29:05.708 --> 06:29:05.718 align:start position:0%
afford this and I perhaps I should have
 
06:29:07.030 --> 06:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
phrased it differently you know that
 
06:29:08.628 --> 06:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
they should perhaps reassess their
 
06:29:11.350 --> 06:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
business model but uh aord was the
 
06:29:13.830 --> 06:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
operative word in the discussion and a
 
06:29:15.430 --> 06:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
Gentleman called me last night and he
 
06:29:17.270 --> 06:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
was giving me a pretty good pretty good
 
06:29:20.190 --> 06:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
talking to and we had a discussion and
 
06:29:22.468 --> 06:29:22.478 align:start position:0%
15 minutes later we were we parted
 
06:29:24.990 --> 06:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
amicably even though I I'm not
 
06:29:27.510 --> 06:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
businessman I've never had an employee
 
06:29:29.230 --> 06:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not now nor have I ever been a
 
06:29:30.830 --> 06:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
member of a union for the benefit of
 
06:29:33.230 --> 06:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
some who may be curious um but I just
 
06:29:34.948 --> 06:29:34.958 align:start position:0%
think that we we have an obligation to
 
06:29:36.948 --> 06:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
to be balanced and to try to address
 
06:29:39.628 --> 06:29:39.638 align:start position:0%
concerns on employer and employee and
 
06:29:42.110 --> 06:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's what the labor committee is for
 
06:29:45.230 --> 06:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting for this
 
06:29:47.670 --> 06:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you represent kahill do I
 
06:29:50.150 --> 06:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
have any additional
 
06:29:53.830 --> 06:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
speakers online on
 
06:29:56.390 --> 06:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
Zoom right the chair I'd like this
 
06:29:59.430 --> 06:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative oh Brian represent SE
 
06:30:03.788 --> 06:30:03.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:07.150 --> 06:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
chairman when I
 
06:30:10.468 --> 06:30:10.478 align:start position:0%
uh was was told I had the honor to be
 
06:30:13.390 --> 06:30:13.400 align:start position:0%
the vice chairman of this committee I
 
06:30:15.670 --> 06:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
was pretty happy because I get to sit up
 
06:30:18.110 --> 06:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
here at hook Porton but the chairman
 
06:30:21.910 --> 06:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
gets to do all the work and uh so it's
 
06:30:23.990 --> 06:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
always great being Vice something
 
06:30:27.670 --> 06:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
however there is one duty that's buried
 
06:30:30.150 --> 06:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
in the house rules that is up to the
 
06:30:33.628 --> 06:30:33.638 align:start position:0%
vice chairman and that is to review the
 
06:30:36.750 --> 06:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
bills for constitutional issues and
 
06:30:40.110 --> 06:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
advise the chairman uh when there is
 
06:30:46.070 --> 06:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
one and uh that actually came to mind
 
06:30:48.430 --> 06:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
because one of the bills we worked on
 
06:30:53.030 --> 06:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
earlier today has this carve out for
 
06:30:55.910 --> 06:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
municipal and County workers that I
 
06:31:00.270 --> 06:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
believe is due to constitutional article
 
06:31:05.030 --> 06:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
28a um which says if you're going to
 
06:31:08.310 --> 06:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
and I I'll actually get the words right
 
06:31:12.270 --> 06:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
here if the state shall not mandate or
 
06:31:14.750 --> 06:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
assign any new expanded or modified
 
06:31:17.388 --> 06:31:17.398 align:start position:0%
programs or responsibilities to any
 
06:31:20.030 --> 06:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
political subdivision in such a way as
 
06:31:22.510 --> 06:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
to necessitate necessitate additional
 
06:31:25.230 --> 06:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
local expenditure so back when when this
 
06:31:28.350 --> 06:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
article was fresh the legislature at
 
06:31:32.830 --> 06:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
that time when we passed broad mandates
 
06:31:35.270 --> 06:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
on employers that increased the cost of
 
06:31:38.270 --> 06:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
doing business we said we have a
 
06:31:42.310 --> 06:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility here either to fund that
 
06:31:45.990 --> 06:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
with State funds or to exempt the
 
06:31:48.590 --> 06:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions and here is a
 
06:31:51.150 --> 06:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
case that yes mostly we're thinking
 
06:31:53.150 --> 06:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
about the private
 
06:31:57.190 --> 06:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
employers um that pay low wages but I'm
 
06:32:00.830 --> 06:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
sure this impacts uh towns and counties
 
06:32:03.230 --> 06:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
and we haven't considered that
 
06:32:07.548 --> 06:32:07.558 align:start position:0%
and I will be voting against it for
 
06:32:10.430 --> 06:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
other reasons as well but my duty
 
06:32:12.830 --> 06:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
according to the rules is to inform the
 
06:32:17.750 --> 06:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:20.350 --> 06:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
concern being
 
06:32:22.868 --> 06:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
informed um I don't see any other hands
 
06:32:26.590 --> 06:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a few comments
 
06:32:29.150 --> 06:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
um I
 
06:32:32.868 --> 06:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
believe that employers should pay for a
 
06:32:34.230 --> 06:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
certain amount of Si
 
06:32:36.510 --> 06:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
days I believe the employer should make
 
06:32:39.270 --> 06:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
that decision on their own I believe
 
06:32:42.150 --> 06:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
that people a good employer which I try
 
06:32:44.150 --> 06:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
to say that I
 
06:32:48.350 --> 06:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
am uh needs to do what he do what's
 
06:32:51.310 --> 06:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
right by his employees in Pay benefits
 
06:32:53.948 --> 06:32:53.958 align:start position:0%
and sick time to retain his good
 
06:32:53.958 --> 06:32:55.190 align:start position:0%
and sick time to retain his good
employees

06:32:55.190 --> 06:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
employees
 
06:32:57.350 --> 06:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
and to have a good working place I am
 
06:33:00.388 --> 06:33:00.398 align:start position:0%
very proud of a good working place not
 
06:33:03.310 --> 06:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
everyone feels the same
 
06:33:03.320 --> 06:33:06.310 align:start position:0%
everyone feels the same
way

06:33:06.310 --> 06:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:33:09.230 --> 06:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
um but I would rather there be an
 
06:33:11.750 --> 06:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
incentive I think this bill is not
 
06:33:13.230 --> 06:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
really a sick time but this is a family
 
06:33:15.548 --> 06:33:15.558 align:start position:0%
leave Bill this is a kind of a a water
 
06:33:16.910 --> 06:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
down family leave Bill and I think that
 
06:33:18.468 --> 06:33:18.478 align:start position:0%
could be taken care through disability
 
06:33:19.788 --> 06:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
because I'm an insurance guy and I think
 
06:33:21.990 --> 06:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
there's a a way that can
 
06:33:25.270 --> 06:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
happen but on this bill
 
06:33:27.990 --> 06:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
I would much rather see
 
06:33:31.670 --> 06:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
something where someone came to me and
 
06:33:34.788 --> 06:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
said an employer if they give each
 
06:33:38.070 --> 06:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
employee up to five sick days a year and
 
06:33:41.310 --> 06:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
they can revolve two of those a year to
 
06:33:43.350 --> 06:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
the next year or three to the next year
 
06:33:45.310 --> 06:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
if you take a quarter of 1% or a half a
 
06:33:48.548 --> 06:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:51.190 --> 06:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
bet because we should
 
06:33:53.948 --> 06:33:53.958 align:start position:0%
encourage as legislators and as a
 
06:33:55.628 --> 06:33:55.638 align:start position:0%
government we're not the government I
 
06:33:58.070 --> 06:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
guess but we kind of are uh to
 
06:34:00.270 --> 06:34:00.280 align:start position:0%
incentivize businesses to do this now
 
06:34:02.110 --> 06:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
not every business can do it but at
 
06:34:03.750 --> 06:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
least if we give them an incentive they
 
06:34:05.708 --> 06:34:05.718 align:start position:0%
will some are already doing it will'll
 
06:34:08.548 --> 06:34:08.558 align:start position:0%
get the incentive some that don't
 
06:34:12.350 --> 06:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily do it will then do the math
 
06:34:14.190 --> 06:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
$20 an
 
06:34:17.910 --> 06:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
hour 72 hours plus you got to add
 
06:34:21.150 --> 06:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
another 30% on for FICA and Fuda and
 
06:34:22.548 --> 06:34:22.558 align:start position:0%
unemployment you know some of these
 
06:34:25.070 --> 06:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
other things so it's it it you know it
 
06:34:27.750 --> 06:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
can get up there um for a small business
 
06:34:29.750 --> 06:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh my nephew who has you know just
 
06:34:30.868 --> 06:34:30.878 align:start position:0%
started the business two or three years
 
06:34:33.110 --> 06:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
ago has three or four employees just
 
06:34:35.910 --> 06:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
starting out um that might be a lot give
 
06:34:37.468 --> 06:34:37.478 align:start position:0%
incentive off as a business Enterprise
 
06:34:39.788 --> 06:34:39.798 align:start position:0%
tax and and that might might do
 
06:34:43.110 --> 06:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
it I also believe as I I'll stand behind
 
06:34:46.270 --> 06:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
what I said which represent Adent
 
06:34:48.788 --> 06:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
commented uh we have uh there are some
 
06:34:51.388 --> 06:34:51.398 align:start position:0%
things in there great you know for the
 
06:34:51.398 --> 06:34:53.388 align:start position:0%
things in there great you know for the
uh

06:34:53.388 --> 06:34:53.398 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:34:53.398 --> 06:34:54.940 align:start position:0%
uh
um

06:34:54.940 --> 06:34:54.950 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:54.950 --> 06:34:56.190 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

06:34:56.190 --> 06:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:34:57.868 --> 06:34:57.878 align:start position:0%
someone who is being
 
06:35:00.548 --> 06:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
stalked or or something like that we
 
06:35:03.150 --> 06:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
actually have a similar law in New
 
06:35:06.270 --> 06:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for unemployment you can get
 
06:35:08.190 --> 06:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
unemployment because of some of the same
 
06:35:10.990 --> 06:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
reasons domestic violence stocking
 
06:35:12.070 --> 06:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
things like
 
06:35:15.310 --> 06:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
that um one of the things that kills me
 
06:35:18.270 --> 06:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:23.868 --> 06:35:23.878 align:start position:0%
penalty when we make laws for businesses
 
06:35:25.468 --> 06:35:25.478 align:start position:0%
we leave it up to the Department of
 
06:35:30.110 --> 06:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
Labor for the most part a vast majority
 
06:35:32.830 --> 06:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
of the violations for
 
06:35:37.708 --> 06:35:37.718 align:start position:0%
not adhering to labor laws is you go in
 
06:35:39.230 --> 06:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
front of the government you go in front
 
06:35:40.430 --> 06:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Labor and they'll
 
06:35:43.110 --> 06:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
find they'll deal with it being able to
 
06:35:45.430 --> 06:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
have civil penalties I I always have a
 
06:35:46.910 --> 06:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
problem with that I can't think of one I
 
06:35:50.310 --> 06:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
know there's a couple um if you tell
 
06:35:52.310 --> 06:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
someone to do something
 
06:35:55.868 --> 06:35:55.878 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh go go go on that well sir
 
06:35:57.830 --> 06:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
my harness you know is isn't is is
 
06:35:59.788 --> 06:35:59.798 align:start position:0%
fright and broken I don't care go do it
 
06:36:02.830 --> 06:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
anyway and gentleman gets hurt or dies
 
06:36:05.150 --> 06:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
that passes it can go through the
 
06:36:07.388 --> 06:36:07.398 align:start position:0%
corporate veil to both the corporation
 
06:36:09.468 --> 06:36:09.478 align:start position:0%
and the personal some of the few things
 
06:36:12.230 --> 06:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
that are out there um but I don't like a
 
06:36:14.868 --> 06:36:14.878 align:start position:0%
civil penalty
 
06:36:17.190 --> 06:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I can't give you what you
 
06:36:19.948 --> 06:36:19.958 align:start position:0%
want representative um I would rather
 
06:36:24.548 --> 06:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
come back as an incentive of bill um I
 
06:36:28.110 --> 06:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
believe if I'm mistaken you feel free to
 
06:36:30.708 --> 06:36:30.718 align:start position:0%
to correct me right now isn't there a
 
06:36:32.150 --> 06:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
similar Senate
 
06:36:34.910 --> 06:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
Bill also that will be coming to us or
 
06:36:36.788 --> 06:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
that it's over there to be dealt with on
 
06:36:40.788 --> 06:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
the same issue as uh PA sick time I
 
06:36:42.990 --> 06:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
think there is but um I don't know
 
06:36:44.510 --> 06:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's the only reason I wouldn't go
 
06:36:47.230 --> 06:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
with the retention so uh I'd really love
 
06:36:50.910 --> 06:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
to have every employer offer sick time
 
06:36:53.190 --> 06:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
it is very good for
 
06:36:53.200 --> 06:36:54.910 align:start position:0%
it is very good for
everybody

06:36:54.910 --> 06:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
06:36:56.350 --> 06:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
government shouldn't decide it but a
 
06:37:00.388 --> 06:37:00.398 align:start position:0%
giving an incentive would be and Walmart
 
06:37:02.110 --> 06:37:02.120 align:start position:0%
gets thrown around a
 
06:37:04.430 --> 06:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
lot and as you know I don't like Walmart
 
06:37:05.670 --> 06:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
I boycott Walmart I'm probably the only
 
06:37:07.110 --> 06:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
one in this room that boycotts Walmart
 
06:37:10.548 --> 06:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
because of the way they are um so you
 
06:37:13.548 --> 06:37:13.558 align:start position:0%
know they are what they are
 
06:37:14.850 --> 06:37:14.860 align:start position:0%
and you
 
06:37:14.860 --> 06:37:17.230 align:start position:0%
and you
[Music]

06:37:17.230 --> 06:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:37:19.510 --> 06:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
know they deserve the reputation they
 
06:37:22.868 --> 06:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
have uh Enough Said by me uh
 
06:37:24.708 --> 06:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
representative kill
 
06:37:27.350 --> 06:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and and I have to
 
06:37:29.510 --> 06:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
be honest did it did not had not
 
06:37:32.990 --> 06:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
occurred to me that this incentive might
 
06:37:35.868 --> 06:37:35.878 align:start position:0%
be the better way to go I I didn't have
 
06:37:38.430 --> 06:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
anything to do with writing the Bill but
 
06:37:41.830 --> 06:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
I think you know if we did put this into
 
06:37:45.510 --> 06:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
a uh some sort of a work session maybe
 
06:37:48.788 --> 06:37:48.798 align:start position:0%
even this term it could be done uh if
 
06:37:51.350 --> 06:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
not certainly retaining it this could be
 
06:37:54.230 --> 06:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
something that most of us could agree on
 
06:37:56.910 --> 06:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
and solve a big a big problem for many
 
06:38:00.310 --> 06:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:03.548 --> 06:38:03.558 align:start position:0%
state thank you K any additional
 
06:38:06.948 --> 06:38:06.958 align:start position:0%

um have an executive session on on a
 
06:40:40.388 --> 06:40:40.398 align:start position:0%

06:40:47.150 --> 06:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
this I I close the executive session and
 
06:40:50.590 --> 06:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
then so that's Clos and U representative
 
06:40:53.430 --> 06:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
San asked me why I did not call both uh
 
06:40:55.788 --> 06:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
minimum wage bills uh
 
06:40:58.548 --> 06:40:58.558 align:start position:0%

06:40:58.558 --> 06:40:59.310 align:start position:0%
today and um I want to see what's going
to

06:40:59.310 --> 06:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:41:01.628 --> 06:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
happen in in
 
06:41:04.868 --> 06:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
Washington um so there's things going
 
06:41:06.190 --> 06:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
back and forth I'm not going to need the
 
06:41:08.190 --> 06:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
debate on the good bad or the ugly it is
 
06:41:10.150 --> 06:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
what it is so we're just I wanted have
 
06:41:12.948 --> 06:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
some time to see what was going on uh
 
06:41:15.110 --> 06:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
that was the reason why I recogniz
 
06:41:18.070 --> 06:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
courtly representative to me um so we
 
06:41:21.430 --> 06:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
will be exacting those remaining bills
 
06:41:24.430 --> 06:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh try to get your
 
06:41:27.510 --> 06:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
blurs to me by Tuesday evening so we can
 
06:41:29.708 --> 06:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
have them ready on Wednesday unless I
 
06:41:32.910 --> 06:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
get a text here from I'm just going to
 
06:41:35.110 --> 06:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
check my text to see if I get a text
 
06:41:36.788 --> 06:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
here from Heather telling me no they
 
06:41:39.070 --> 06:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
have to be in sooner I'm waiting for you
 
06:41:42.388 --> 06:41:42.398 align:start position:0%
Heather if you are listening but it
 
06:41:43.948 --> 06:41:43.958 align:start position:0%
probably would help her to have it in a
 
06:41:47.948 --> 06:41:47.958 align:start position:0%
little bit sooner um it did last year um
 
06:41:50.270 --> 06:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
if you just um made it a day earlier I
 
06:41:52.230 --> 06:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
think that would be and we we've got
 
06:41:54.270 --> 06:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
plenty of days to do it if everyone can
 
06:41:55.990 --> 06:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
get them to me on Monday evening great
 
06:41:57.270 --> 06:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know I'll I'll deal with Tuesday
 
06:41:59.510 --> 06:41:59.520 align:start position:0%

Wednesday March 4th uh Wednesday is
 
06:42:19.310 --> 06:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
March 3D right I I I apologize I may
 
06:42:20.948 --> 06:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
have misspoken I meant Thursday I'm
 
06:42:22.548 --> 06:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
trying to keep us consistent there are
 
06:42:24.350 --> 06:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
certain people have a job jobs and they
 
06:42:26.190 --> 06:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
want to be able to uh first of all I
 
06:42:27.910 --> 06:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to keep people out any more
 
06:42:30.548 --> 06:42:30.558 align:start position:0%
than they have to be um to lose a day of
 
06:42:32.670 --> 06:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
work and I want to keep it consistent
 
06:42:35.110 --> 06:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
because many people have a situation
 
06:42:36.788 --> 06:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
