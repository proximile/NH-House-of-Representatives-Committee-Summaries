and we'll be amazed to see all the
 
00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:26.359 align:start position:0%
different agreements which we have for
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
co-ops and the very different agreements
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
they all are and how some co-ops don't
 
00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
even have
 
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
agreements and so there's a lot to this

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
going with all this uh in past years the
 
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:45.160 align:start position:0%

00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
structure of Education in this state
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
from a management
 
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
perspective so that be on 313 that's
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%

Thursday on the 13th will start at 10

caucuses we will have will be prior to
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%

here start
 
01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
1418 use of EA efas to purchase school
 
01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:55.990 align:start position:0%
1418 use of EA efas to purchase school
uniforms

01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
uniforms
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah representative pel I look to
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
you for a
 
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.710 align:start position:0%
you for a
motion

01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
1418 so we have motion for itl on 148
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
this abill use of efas to purchase
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
School UNS made by representative Pell

Miler further discussion from making the
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you um this bill is
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm moving itl because school
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
uniforms can be an integral part of an
 
01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
education and requirement for students
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
to attend private schools therefore
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
they're a necessary part of their
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
education and I would consider that I
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
would consider removing this from the
 
01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%

were as the maker of that we're ready
 
01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much um yeah this
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
bill um has had a lot of work put into
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
it by um citizens as well as the prime
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor um representative Andress um the
 
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um makes uh a number of
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
changes um and that I think one of the
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
major ones is that um it uh eliminates
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
from uh the bill uh at col
 
01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
Athletics uh it limits it to U middle
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
and high school
 
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
students um and also eliminates uh
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
grades K through
 
01:10:38.669 --> 01:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
four um so I think that's one of the
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
main uh differences in the bill there
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
are some just changes in in
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
definitions uh but the uh Amendment uh
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
goes on to talk about um uh provisions
 
01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
of birth certific ific Ates um and um
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
issues related to that um as well as uh
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
on the uh second page um specifies uh
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
possible causes of action um for
 
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
students um who are uh impacted um by
 
01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.390 align:start position:0%
students um who are uh impacted um by
uh

01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
nonadherence um
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
basically uh to the uh bill um and try
 
01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.110 align:start position:0%
basically uh to the uh bill um and try
to

01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
clarify uh some things from the original
 
01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.310 align:start position:0%
clarify uh some things from the original
bill

01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
um in addition to uh as I mentioned the
 
01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
birth certificate and um issues related
 
01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
to the uh birth certificate which I
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
think are important in terms of uh
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
defining the uh biological sex of the
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
um I I'll leave it there I think some
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
other people are probably going to
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
comment on
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
this okay I I made the second on that
 
01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.629 align:start position:0%
this okay I I made the second on that
and

01:12:02.629 --> 01:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh I may just I I'll address a little
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
bit of it right now um while I was a
 
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
school administrator I had the
 
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility for coordinating
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
Athletics in the keenai peninsula
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
burough School District that's a school
 
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
district a size of West Virginia that's
 
01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:19.430 align:start position:0%
district a size of West Virginia that's
in

01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
Alaska and we had a a huge population up
 
01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.430 align:start position:0%
Alaska and we had a a huge population up
there

01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
and we um I had members of my own family
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
who were running in track and
 
01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
field and my daughter was a runner and
 
01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
went on full right scholarship to Texas
 
01:12:42.189 --> 01:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
A&amp;M ran for them my other daughter came
 
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
down as a point guard of a college here
 
01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
in the east coast um subsequently I have
 
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
a granddaughter who participated and
 
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
Captain the University of main indoor
 
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
and outdoor track teams
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
and set pentathlon records for New
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
England against all the
 
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
colleges uh I have a grandson that's
 
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
very much involved in playing right now
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
in in the basketball league over New
 
01:13:07.229 --> 01:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
York State dealing with the Liberty
 
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
league and doing quite well um and I
 
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
believe that Sports uh that we have and
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
have known have been Guided by Title
 
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
9 and that's providing the equity and
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
equality that we needed to elevate women
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
in sports like remember when my wife was
 
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
a young student before I knew her and
 
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
played basketball over in Rumford Maine
 
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
um girls were only allowed to take three
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
dribbles and had to pass the ball off
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
things have changed in athletics today
 
01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
if you watched how the Carolina girls
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
are playing
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
basketball uh in South Carolina it's
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
amazing what we've seen as a a total
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
growth in terms of uh elevating the
 
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
level of of women's sports
 
01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
however I'm concerned that when we're
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
putting a person that's changed their
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
gender and I'm not going to go with all
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
the the issues associated with that but
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
a male is stronger there's no question
 
01:14:07.679 --> 01:14:08.430 align:start position:0%
a male is stronger there's no question
about

01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
it and I saw that occur when I had the
 
01:14:15.629 --> 01:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
granddaughter who was running for main
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
Orno running against uh an individual
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
from Franklin Pierce who was a that
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
national champion for for divis
 
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
two and that individual one easily hands
 
01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
over all the girls which were
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
running and and it's so there there is
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
an issue out there I would hate to see
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
my my grandson who's another athlete
 
01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
only in a different way who is a center
 
01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
for a Collegiate team he's 7 foot tall
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
and could he be changing and participate
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
in that sport as a girl what would he do
 
01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
he devastate what's going on in the
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
court so I think there are a lot of
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
rationalities I've seen in my own family
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
and as administrator where I had to deal
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
with issues like this in Alaska this
 
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
bill right here is one where we're not
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
touching the Collegiate at all but what
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
we are doing is we're addressing the
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
high school and the middle schools and
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
recognizing the intermal schools it
 
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter anybody should be able to
 
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
play on those intermal times and have
 
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
fun and enjoy but when you're getting to
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
the areas the middle and the high school
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
then it starts to break apart and we've
 
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
seen what's happened in Connecticut
 
01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen what's happened where people
 
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
losing their scholarship opportunities
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that they've been beat
 
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
out by a person that changed their
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
gender while they were in high
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
school so I for one have a very
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
difficult time uh seeing what's going on
 
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
with this whole opportunity for young
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
ladies in our Athletics today and I'm
 
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get it back to where we've had
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
it and where it provides opportunity
 
01:15:57.629 --> 01:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
which is fair and Equitable for all the
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
young women in this state thank
 
01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
you any other discussion from the
 
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
committee represent pel thank you Mr
 
01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
chair yes this this bill is actually
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
very personal to me over 10 years ago my
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
daughter came to me when there was a
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
transgender Athlete on her team and said
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
Mom this isn't fair what can we do about
 
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
it and my response to her was would you
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
like to make a federal case out of this
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
because I knew that was exactly where we
 
01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
were going and now we're 10 years into
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
this and we are starting to see what
 
01:16:33.149 --> 01:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
happens to women when they are displaced
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
by men on sports teams we have seen
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
injuries occur we have been telling our
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
women and girls to sit back and let men
 
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
take their place um I we all received in
 
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
the mail a letter from somebody who is a
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
well-respected High School cross country
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
coach I have Co coached with this man
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
and he's concerned about women losing
 
01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:01.159 align:start position:0%
scholarships and it's more than that
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
we've heard a representative say that um
 
01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
oh maybe a man competing a boy competing
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
in the women's high jump isn't really a
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
big deal because it's a sport that
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
people don't watch anyway well the girls
 
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
that are competing in that high jump
 
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
that's the world to
 
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
them the person who sent this letter to
 
01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:24.440 align:start position:0%
me said well maybe women shouldn't it it
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
it only matters if they're losing
 
01:17:30.629 --> 01:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
scholarships no it matters if you are
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
displaced on any team for any reason by
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
somebody who is not competing fairly
 
01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:37.950 align:start position:0%
somebody who is not competing fairly
with

01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
you I really understand the issues that
 
01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
are facing people who are have
 
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.110 align:start position:0%
are facing people who are have
conflicting

01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
conflicting
 
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
um gender identity it it's I can't even
 
01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
imagine what they're facing but
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
if we don't pass a bill like this we are
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
letting our women and our daughters down
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
and we might as well go back to 1919
 
01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
before we had the right to vote
 
01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.229 align:start position:0%
before we had the right to vote
representative

01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and I would say as I have many times
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
before that um I am a person who has
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
taught physical education who's who's
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
competed in
 
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
sports uh who's coached women in sports
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
um who was a person who benefited
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
greatly during title n uh title n just
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
like uh our Chairman's wife uh probably
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
we about the same age uh went from a
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
time when we didn't have opportunity um
 
01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
you know on Little League baseball or um
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
to actually play basketball the way it
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
was meant to be
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
played um so I am a strong person for
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
women's in sports but I'm also a strong
 
01:18:59.950 --> 01:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
person for
 
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination and this is really
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
about discrimination it's about
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
discriminating against less than
 
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
1% of the kids that go to school less
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
than 1% so we're talking about not
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
taking over a sport or taking over a
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
group we're talking about people who
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.390 align:start position:0%
group we're talking about people who
um

01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
are trying to fit in who are trying to
 
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
be be um their authentic self and it
 
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
must be very difficult and they they
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
have to go through um bullying and a lot
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
of other things let alone adults telling
 
01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
them uh that they can't be part of a
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
team um I wanted to address a couple of
 
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
things before I get to the part that's
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
really um sent me right over the roof um
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
the first part is scholar ships when you
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
go for a scholarship for a college it
 
01:20:00.189 --> 01:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
isn't based on one performance it isn't
 
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:03.719 align:start position:0%
based on your records or whatever as
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
much as it is on your work ethic and
 
01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
your native athletic ability and what
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
the coaches at that college think that
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to provide so
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
nobody nobody has been denied a
 
01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
scholarship because a transgender
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
student beat them
 
01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.270 align:start position:0%
student beat them
out

01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
injuries happen all the time in sports
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
they're part of being in sports you take
 
01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
that risk in fact that's one of the kind
 
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
of fun things about it is you test your
 
01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
body to the limits um you're trying to
 
01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:37.719 align:start position:0%
be as competitive as possible and when
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
you do that sometimes injuries happen
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
there has been no injuries directly
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
related to a trans person actually um
 
01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
causing that injury outside of what it
 
01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
would normally be in an athletic event
 
01:20:58.990 --> 01:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
okay then we go on to um this high jump
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
thing that's been circulated through and
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's actually my school the school that
 
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
I worked and coached at kir Sarge and I
 
01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
have to tell you how upset I am about
 
01:21:13.629 --> 01:21:13.639 align:start position:0%
this that this poor person has been um
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
put in in emails put in letters that
 
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
have been sent even a a whole pamphlet
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
that was sent up and it was all full of
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
misinformation uh misinformation in the
 
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
fact that yes this person did win the
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
high jump at 5'2 there was also a girl
 
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
from summersworth who jumped and
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
completed the 52 um height as well but
 
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
came in second place because she had a
 
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
Miss at 5
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
foot the record for women's high jump in
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is 6
 
01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
feet okay not 52 which uh was intimated
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
in in that letter um the winner of the
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
boys high jump in that same meat was 6
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
feet and in competition you should know
 
01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
that in high jump the bars raised 2 Ines
 
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
at a time not one inch so that was
 
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
another thing in the in the little
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
pamphlet that went around to out this
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
person uh that was just totally totally
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
wrong so I guess the last thing that I I
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to go to about this amendment
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
that I think is just outrageous and
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
totally discriminatory and is going to
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
end up in a court of law and that's
 
01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
school athletes cause of action and if
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
you I know you just got this amendment
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
so you probably didn't have time to see
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
this but not only do we have and we've
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
had people in this uh come see us who
 
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
have had puberty blockers who are um
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
transitioning and they've had puberty
 
01:22:57.390 --> 01:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
blockers before
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
puberty and what this bill is doing is
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's making it so that I would
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
assume a parent could walk up to the
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
coach and say hey I think that girl is a
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
trans girl because we know as we see
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
them here they look just like girls
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
because they've transitioned through
 
01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.510 align:start position:0%
because they've transitioned through
hormone

01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
hormone
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
replacement and then they have to go
 
01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:24.280 align:start position:0%
through all this this rigot to try and
 
01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
prove that they're they're female and um
 
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
then it not only that but it says that
 
01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
the person the people that bring it can
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
actually have civil action initiated
 
01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
when two years of the harm occur
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
harm harm is a result of what and
 
01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
damages what damages okay are we talking
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
about somebody that feels uncomfortable
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
them okay and then um they can get
 
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
sued it's just this first of all it's
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
just cruel to pick on
 
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:10.280 align:start position:0%
kids who are going through a gender
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
crisis who have done the
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
hormones and and then put them through
 
01:24:17.629 --> 01:24:17.639 align:start position:0%
this and their parents through this
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
we've we've had them come and tell you
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
some of the problems that they've been
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
having you know we yesterday we talked
 
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
about the mask history well you know you
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
think it's tough transgender kids have
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
it even tougher and transgender parents
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
have it tougher the people that have
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
those kids and and to single them out
 
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
just so it's a good campaign thing and
 
01:24:43.629 --> 01:24:43.639 align:start position:0%
just because we you know you're afraid
 
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
of people because they're different um I
 
01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
think is no reason to make these kids um
 
01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.790 align:start position:0%
think is no reason to make these kids um
Paras

01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
Paras
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
Paras one of the reasons you're not
 
01:24:59.629 --> 01:24:59.639 align:start position:0%
using elementary students and you're not
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
using College people is because NCI
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
NCAA is the governing body for
 
01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:08.950 align:start position:0%
NCAA is the governing body for
Collegiate

01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
Collegiate
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
Sports nhia the New Hampshire inter
 
01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:15.719 align:start position:0%
Scholastic Athletic Association is the
 
01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
association that's set in the state and
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's a National Association of
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
States uh inter Scholastic athletic
 
01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
teams they are the people who look at
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
how competition is happening make the
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
determination just like the Olympic
 
01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
teams do about who can compete
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
fairly and also they adjust the rules
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
for competition to make it as safe as
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
possible they also oversee the
 
01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
officiating of different
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
sports so what we're doing is we're
 
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
doing what the inter Scholastic Athletic
 
01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.790 align:start position:0%
doing what the inter Scholastic Athletic
Association

01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:25:55.629 --> 01:25:55.639 align:start position:0%
we're we're taking over their job okay
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
and they are people who are sports
 
01:26:00.669 --> 01:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
athletic athletic people um that have
 
01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
been trained in that there're also
 
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
people who are athletic trainers they're
 
01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
also Sports Physicians they're also
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
people from college that that are um
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
endocrinologists and and involved in
 
01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
this that's that's how they make their
 
01:26:18.109 --> 01:26:18.119 align:start position:0%
decision we are a group of 20 people and
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
out of 20 people we don't know the same
 
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
information and have the same
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
professional experience as these people
 
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
that are on these regulatory boards and
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
the regulatory board center around
 
01:26:37.149 --> 01:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
hormones and um I'm obviously going to
 
01:26:39.550 --> 01:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
vote against this bill I guess that's
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
probably uh you know stating the obvious
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
but I just want to say that that I'm
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
ashamed to be a part of this bill to
 
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
even talk about this bill to even see
 
01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
this amendment because how cruel it is
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
how discriminatory it is and how
 
01:27:01.109 --> 01:27:01.119 align:start position:0%
ignorant it is thank you representa
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you I have to I guess
 
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
take offense to the um statement that uh
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
this is a good campaign thing and that's
 
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
why it's being brought forward um I
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
think Title 9 if I'm not mistaken it
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
dates back to 1972 or at least the early
 
01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
1970s um women
 
01:27:25.870 --> 01:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
um fought for a long time to get
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
equality in sports um you
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
know I you know I'm not going to be back
 
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
around that time but I know that um
 
01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
there were uh very many issues and years
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
of uh discussion about the fact of the
 
01:27:50.109 --> 01:27:50.119 align:start position:0%
um and even recently in terms of um
 
01:27:53.149 --> 01:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
professional soccer or um the US soccer
 
01:27:56.430 --> 01:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
team uh that um male athletes were
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
getting paid way more um than um female
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
athletes uh more Scholarships in college
 
01:28:09.310 --> 01:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
um Etc so getting a quality for women in
 
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
sports was not a campaign thing back
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
then and it's not a campaign thing now
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
as I think representative Pell was
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
getting at this is
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
um might want to call it a women's
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
rights issue
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and four or five years ago maybe you
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
remember um chairman lad we had uh
 
01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
another bill um like this um in our
 
01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
committee and uh that was about the time
 
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
that um uh there was a high school
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
athletic uh track competition in
 
01:28:49.629 --> 01:28:49.639 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and three transgender males
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
took the first three spots in and the
 
01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.430 align:start position:0%
took the first three spots in and the
state

01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
championships and knocked out the
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
leading uh female uh runners in the
 
01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
state up to that point um and they were
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
um denied scholarships they did not get
 
01:29:10.109 --> 01:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
scholarships they would have if they had
 
01:29:14.189 --> 01:29:14.199 align:start position:0%
been um uh competing against just fellow
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh female athletes so it certainly has
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
impacted and there certainly has been
 
01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
injuries um not long ago there was a um
 
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
I think it was field hockey um uh young
 
01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
lady had her teeth knocked out when uh
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
transgender um uh male from the other
 
01:29:39.109 --> 01:29:39.119 align:start position:0%
team uh through the uh soccer soccer
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
ball at her and knocked her teeth out
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's no soccer ball in field hockey
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
well I'm sorry I misspoke right I I I I
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
think I realized that I think I
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
misspoke excuse me I think I have the
 
01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
floor if you want to rebut it rebut it
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
later after the person has Flo it's not
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
you keep your comments until you have
 
01:30:01.149 --> 01:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
please um so yes I misspoke and this was
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
a soccer uh game
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
um so there have been injuries we've
 
01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
seen it in um high school wrestling um
 
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
Collegiate wrestling um with
 
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
transgenders wrestling against um
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
females so um to say there have been no
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
denial of scholarships no injuries I
 
01:30:29.629 --> 01:30:29.639 align:start position:0%
think is a a gross exaggeration and um I
 
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
really uh as the maker the maker of this
 
01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
amendment um I find it offensive to say
 
01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
that this is I'm doing this as a
 
01:30:39.159 --> 01:30:40.950 align:start position:0%
that this is I'm doing this as a
campaign

01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
thing further further testimony
 
01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:47.119 align:start position:0%
represent Terry thank
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
you uh in addition to my having diff
 
01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.550 align:start position:0%
you uh in addition to my having diff
difficulty

01:30:53.550 --> 01:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
difficulty
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
accepting this uh modern uh
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
notion uh and dystopian notion if I
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
might say that there is really uh no
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
difference between uh biological males
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
and biological females particularly when
 
01:31:11.229 --> 01:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
it comes to the matter of contact uh
 
01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
competitive Sports at the middle school
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
and the high school level I I also
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
believe um that facts matter and we've
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
had the assertion made
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
in this debate this discussion on this
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
bill that there have been no injuries
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
sustained as a result of a transnational
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
a transgendered person competing in
 
01:31:37.709 --> 01:31:37.719 align:start position:0%
women's sports that is factually
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
incorrect In the far away place of
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts a high school basket girls
 
01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
basketball team was forced to Forfeit
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
its game after a transgender player on
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
the opposing team injured three players
 
01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:53.800 align:start position:0%
players the game was between the
 
01:31:57.109 --> 01:31:57.119 align:start position:0%
Collegiate Charter School of L's girl L
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
girls against Kip
 
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.550 align:start position:0%
girls against Kip
Massachusetts

01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
three female players were injured by a
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
transgendered male biological male on
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
the other team and this forced on the
 
01:32:14.430 --> 01:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
grounds of safety and this is really
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here safety for
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
women safety for women on the grounds of
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
safety for women the coach forfeited the
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
game to the other
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
team so it is factually incorrect to
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
assert that there have been no injuries
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
sustained as a result of transgendered
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
players being allowed to play
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
competitively in intramural sports in
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
this country and that is only one of
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
many instances where this has occurred
 
01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
so to make the statement that there have
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
been no injuries is factually and
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
egregiously Incorrect and it is
 
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
offensive thank you representer
 
01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair excuse
 
01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
me I would like to read these remarks
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
from a New Hampshire
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
resident I'm writing to you hoping that
 
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
I can count on you to put up a strong
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
fight against
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
hp25 I'm not actually a resident of the
 
01:33:16.109 --> 01:33:16.119 align:start position:0%
area you represent I live in Newport
 
01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
voicing my opinion to my actual state
 
01:33:19.709 --> 01:33:19.719 align:start position:0%
senator or Representatives would be a
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
total waste of time I am the proud but
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
increasingly fearful father of a
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
transgender girl hb25 would take away
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
her opportunity to play school sports my
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
daughter like most transgender athletes
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't stand out during games she is
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
average at best but loves the team
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
aspect of the one sport she plays she
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
wants to be able to do what her friends
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
do she wants to enjoy being part of a
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
team she has been accepted by the
 
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
majority of her team and it's
 
01:33:51.109 --> 01:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
heartwarming to see parents from our
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
town that we know have voiced anti-trans
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
sentiments cheer her on and yell her
 
01:33:59.709 --> 01:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
name while the far right will try to
 
01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
make everyone believe that trans women
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
are dominating Sports it's just not the
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
case girls school sports in New
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are not being dominated or
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
ruined by trans girls and they are
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
playing I think trans girls should be
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to play at worst I could live
 
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
with each School District deciding for
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
themselves if your Republican colleagues
 
01:34:21.629 --> 01:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
actually believed in limited government
 
01:34:23.109 --> 01:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
they would leave it to the districts
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
instead of passing a discriminatory
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
state law there is no truer expression
 
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
of freedom than continuing to be
 
01:34:32.350 --> 01:34:32.360 align:start position:0%
yourself in spite of all the people who
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
continue to say you shouldn't exist and
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
you have no rights vote down 1205 thank
 
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
you and that's my
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%

school piece uh sir to mean if if I am a
 
01:35:36.109 --> 01:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
acad private Academy playing against uh
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
kenet high school that if I have a trans
 
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
male or a trans female on my team then
 
01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
my can high school is not allowed to
 
01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:53.150 align:start position:0%
participate is that what that means
 
01:35:53.150 --> 01:35:54.229 align:start position:0%
participate is that what that means
[Music]

01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:05.430 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
I I believe that um the intent here is
 
01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
that um again we want to make it a uh a
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
fair playing field um for uh female
 
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
students in public schools so this is a
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
protection against um the instance when
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
a private school would be competing um
 
01:36:32.669 --> 01:36:32.679 align:start position:0%
against that public school and there is
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
a a transgender athlete uh in uh the uh
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
private school who is a competitor in
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
that uh uh in that game May I follow
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you well just respond thank you I
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
I understand the intent of what you just
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
said R cordelli but but that doesn't
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
negate what this says it says if I'm in
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
a private if a private school brings a
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
transgender male or transgender female
 
01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
to Kenneth High School to play in a say
 
01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
Spring sport uh does this mean Kenneth
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
them it says that the um it must be
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
expressly designated that one of these I
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
understand that asking I'm asking what
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
that means I understand that I
 
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:22.360 align:start position:0%
understand I think I think well would be
 
01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
in the um purview of kennet High School
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh to decline to play in that game we've
 
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
seen that around the country and other
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh other um schools in other states
 
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying they can't decline that
 
01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
means they can't
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
play I I don't see where it says they
 
01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
cannot play okay may I follow Mr chair
 
01:37:48.589 --> 01:37:48.599 align:start position:0%
yes thank you on the am uh I understand
 
01:37:48.599 --> 01:37:50.070 align:start position:0%
yes thank you on the am uh I understand
Item

01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
Item
 
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
B uh
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
should there be an item C the females
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
sport um yeah possibly it's not right it
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't say that right but um
 
01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:09.159 align:start position:0%
I think I'm not sure I'm not sure if
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
we've seen U many of those um instances
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think that there have been any
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that I'm aware of well
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not Mr M yeah thank you um
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
so I I say that in terms I'm thinking
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
particularly of the sport of of softball
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
and baseball baseball particularly and
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
football where we've seen
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
females uh this year uh playing p and
 
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
kick and quarterback uh on an all boy
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
typically all young men uh uh boys
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
football team so this this I just
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
understand it seems to me it's it is
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
discriminat to that extent that it's
 
01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
discriminatory so that was that was my
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
only two questions cuz as I read 12 it
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
means private schools that come we can't
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
play against them if we can it uh and
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
see is missing that it's not fair for
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
once it's fair for women but not fair
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
for men it sort of seems discriminatory
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
to me because there's no C there are
 
01:39:08.830 --> 01:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
there are there further questions
 
01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:10.070 align:start position:0%
there are there further questions
representative

01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair not a question
 
01:39:14.830 --> 01:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
but just a yeah discuss anecdote you
 
01:39:17.709 --> 01:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
might say about this um you might not be
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
able to tell about looking at me but
 
01:39:20.589 --> 01:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
there was a time that I was very
 
01:39:20.599 --> 01:39:21.910 align:start position:0%
there was a time that I was very
athletic

01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
athletic
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
and very competitive 9 a little after
 
01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.669 align:start position:0%
and very competitive 9 a little after
that

01:39:26.669 --> 01:39:26.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:29.950 --> 01:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
2000s I was so athletic and so
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
competitive that in high school I was
 
01:39:35.629 --> 01:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
removed from gym class no longer allowed
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
to participate in gym class because I
 
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
was judged to be an object of danger to
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
the young women in that class now it
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
took me off a little bit of time but let
 
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
me tell you that in hindsight I am so
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
glad they did that because let me tell
 
01:39:54.310 --> 01:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
you at 14 15 16 years old I was not
 
01:39:57.629 --> 01:39:57.639 align:start position:0%
properly in control of myself nor did I
 
01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
have the presence of mind to tone myself
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
down when I was in those situations and
 
01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
I would have had that on my conscience
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
if I had badly hurt someone thank you
 
01:40:11.550 --> 01:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
leus first I want to start with saying I
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
am not afraid of people who are
 
01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
different from me and I don't like the
 
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
implication I have friends who are trans
 
01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
I grew up before uh Title 9 there were
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
Sports I wanted to play that I couldn't
 
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
play because I was a girl those Sports
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
now exist I've seen a lot of change in
 
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
the attitudes towards women women are no
 
01:40:40.189 --> 01:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
longer or weren't any longer told to sit
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
down shut up don't complain and let the
 
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
boys beat you but now I see this as
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
discriminatory against women athletes
 
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
because they are being told no you can't
 
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
complain no you can't say anything
 
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
you'll get in trouble because you be
 
01:40:58.030 --> 01:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
considered transphobic and all that
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
other stuff um sit down shut up don't
 
01:41:05.070 --> 01:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
complain let them take your position let
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
them get the scholarships so now we're
 
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
back to pre-title 9 we're back to you're
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
just a woman you don't
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
count and it's the same thing I grew up
 
01:41:19.629 --> 01:41:19.639 align:start position:0%
with and I don't think it's right but if
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
I thought I could get away with a bill
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
that said all schools must have um mixed
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
Sports co-ed Sports I would do that
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
except that we're told we're not allow
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
we're not supposed to be doing that but
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
um because that that should be a local
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
control issue but I think the answer to
 
01:41:41.589 --> 01:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
this is to have lots of co-ed Sports and
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
that way everybody can play sports and
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
it isn't an issue so we can have boy
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
Sports girl Sports and coed Sports and
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's what I would encourage people to
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
do if they want to solve the issue and I
 
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
think it is an issue I think trans kids
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely should be able to play sports
 
01:42:01.589 --> 01:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
I say have coed teams thank
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
you somebody hasn't spoken for a little
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
bit here representative
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr
 
01:42:09.679 --> 01:42:12.030 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr
chair

01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:42:15.589 --> 01:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
um I hesitate to really respond to this
 
01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
because it's it's a controversial issue
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
there's no question about this now my
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
concern is the volume of trans students
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
who want to participate in
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
sports they want to participate in
 
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
sports not because of a
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship they want to participate to
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
be member of a
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
team to learn what leadership skills
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
are organization
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
skills you know sometimes I think that
 
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
people think that trans girls are men in
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
drag right they're not that at
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
all for a student to make the
 
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
decision to become a trans
 
01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
individual it's not done willy-nilly
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a major life decision that
 
01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.830 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a major life decision that
one

01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
makes and we've heard families come
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
before us here and talk about the
 
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
decision ision that the family had to
 
01:43:25.149 --> 01:43:25.159 align:start position:0%
make to
 
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
recognize the gender
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
identification that an individual wants
 
01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:31.910 align:start position:0%
identification that an individual wants
to

01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
make and when that decision is made it
 
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
puts into place a whole series of
 
01:43:41.589 --> 01:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
activities that an individual goes
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
through it's not just I'm going to wear
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
a dress
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
now you're going through a whole
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
hormonal kind of a situation it's under
 
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.390 align:start position:0%
hormonal kind of a situation it's under
medical

01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
guidance it's a significant change here
 
01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
now I can understand the issue of I
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
didn't get a
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
scholarship but let's jge the position I
 
01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
didn't get a
 
01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship to the number of students
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
who participate in a sport that are just
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
average and they just want to be
 
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
there this bill would deny him that
 
01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:22.350 align:start position:0%
there this bill would deny him that
opportunity

01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
frankly one of the persons I love to
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
watch is Kon
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
Clark she's better than any male athlete
 
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
in college right
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
now all
 
01:44:37.589 --> 01:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
right and my concern is is
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
that the Caitlyn Clarks of the world are
 
01:44:43.149 --> 01:44:43.159 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
okay but I'm concerned about those who
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
aren't at that level of proficiency in
 
01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
athletics they just want to be there
 
01:44:54.030 --> 01:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
they just want
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to participate in something
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
that they want to
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
do after they've made that decision that
 
01:45:05.589 --> 01:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
they want to be their true
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
self this bill denies them and that's
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about the issue of
 
01:45:14.669 --> 01:45:14.679 align:start position:0%
the right of action I mean this it it
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
the the penalties that are in this
 
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
amendment are egregious and I think are
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
really an insult to every child who
 
01:45:27.589 --> 01:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
decides that they want to change their
 
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
gender identity and participate in
 
01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
sports this anti-trans bill that's what
 
01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
this is let's put it right out
 
01:45:38.109 --> 01:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
there and that's why I'm not going to
 
01:45:38.119 --> 01:45:39.149 align:start position:0%
there and that's why I'm not going to
support

01:45:39.149 --> 01:45:39.159 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
this and I'm not going to support the
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
major bill because I'm concerned about
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
those children those kids who are out
 
01:45:52.589 --> 01:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
be the one who's going to receive the
 
01:45:58.589 --> 01:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
scholarship but the greater percentage
 
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
of those who just want to
 
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
participate and be them be there with
 
01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:04.629 align:start position:0%
participate and be them be there with
their

01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:46:06.589 --> 01:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
friends thank
 
01:46:08.830 --> 01:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
you representa
 
01:46:11.229 --> 01:46:11.239 align:start position:0%
pel thank
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
you so many things have come up and I
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
hate to say that I do have experience
 
01:46:18.510 --> 01:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
situation um to be begin with there was
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
conversation about these um about
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
transgender people both sides men and
 
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
women being under the care of
 
01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
Physicians and in particular
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
endocrinologists and I would like to
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
point out that endocrinologists stand to
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
make a significant amount of money once
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
you get a child on transgender hormones
 
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
you have a patient for life it is a
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
million billion dollar industry
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
um as far as the nhiaa being um the
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
governing body more than 10 years ago
 
01:46:58.719 --> 01:47:00.589 align:start position:0%
governing body more than 10 years ago
lgbtq

01:47:00.589 --> 01:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
lgbtq
 
01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
organizations took the approach of
 
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
getting of changing the policy on every
 
01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.030 align:start position:0%
getting of changing the policy on every
single

01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
single
 
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
athletic um organization at the state
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
level and allowing transgender athletes
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
to perform in sports opposite of their
 
01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
sex they took the back door approach and
 
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's why we need this legislation now
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to lawsuits if you I
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
want you to recall that I told my
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
daughter that this would be a federal
 
01:47:34.109 --> 01:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
case if we wanted to pursue it so I feel
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
like it would have been cruel and
 
01:47:37.390 --> 01:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
unusual punishment for my family to have
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
pursued a
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
lawsuit um and we talk a lot we're
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
talking about people getting hurt but
 
01:47:46.510 --> 01:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
what we physically we've talk spoken
 
01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
about people getting hurt what we
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
haven't spoken about is the damage to
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
our daughters
 
01:47:56.910 --> 01:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
self-esteem these our daughters are also
 
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
trying to be their authentic
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
selves when they are told that they
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
can't compete on a team because there
 
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
are tryouts so someone who's physically
 
01:48:10.589 --> 01:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
stronger than you is going to take your
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
spot it you may be the second to last
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
choice on the
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
team and you may not make the team
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
because just because of train
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
a um a boy who is transitioning to be a
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
female is one step ahead of you you
 
01:48:31.229 --> 01:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
might lose your spot this isn't about
 
01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
scholarships this is about women's
 
01:48:37.629 --> 01:48:37.639 align:start position:0%
self-esteem this is a pro women pro
 
01:48:41.229 --> 01:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
daughter Pro girl bill and I will
 
01:48:41.239 --> 01:48:44.669 align:start position:0%
daughter Pro girl bill and I will
support

01:48:44.669 --> 01:48:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
it uh represent
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
Tanner so yes we've had a lot of
 
01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
uh discussion around here and there's an
 
01:48:54.750 --> 01:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
awful lot of misinformation thrown out
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
about transgender and about
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
transitioning and I think it's
 
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a real insult to
 
01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
Physicians of all types including
 
01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
endocrinologists to to say that they
 
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
would do something that um would be just
 
01:49:16.430 --> 01:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
money uh to keep to transition a kid and
 
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
keep under under that puberty blocker
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
forever for just for money I think
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
that's against uh hypocritic oath and a
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
few other things the thing about what
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
we've heard and as I pointed out this
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
whole thing about this high school high
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
jumper um and obviously there was no
 
01:49:43.390 --> 01:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
safety uh problem with that um is that
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
there was misinformation purposely sent
 
01:49:49.709 --> 01:49:49.719 align:start position:0%
out misinformation which has just been
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
unb un believable in our emails
 
01:49:55.229 --> 01:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
unbelievable to people so it's hard to
 
01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
believe when somebody says oh there was
 
01:49:59.470 --> 01:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
you know three people hurt on a
 
01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
basketball team
 
01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
well as I said before there has not been
 
01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
any sports
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
injuries attributed to a transgender
 
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
athlete who's done it on purpose and and
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
people get their teeth knocked out in
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
field hockey unfortunately and they now
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
gone to mouth uh guards on that uh women
 
01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
girls got their teeth knocked out in
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
Lacrosse that's happened now that's
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
that's got a safety issue if if a
 
01:50:33.390 --> 01:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
basketball team uh has an issue with
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
injuries and something that's being
 
01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
unfairly done on the court that's an
 
01:50:42.109 --> 01:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
officials uh problem and the nhiaa is
 
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
part of a federal part of a national not
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
federal but National independent
 
01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
Athletic Association that are overseen
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
by principes and superintendents and
 
01:50:57.910 --> 01:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
coaches and athletic directors and um
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
they make the decisions as to whether
 
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
this the sports are how the sports are
 
01:51:07.069 --> 01:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
run how the tournaments are run Etc so I
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
think that's a little bit of an issue
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
too but I think you also have to look at
 
01:51:13.870 --> 01:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
this bill and say why is it okay for
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
kids up to you know fifth grade to be
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
able to compete together why is that
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
okay and then after after fifth grade
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden it's a real big problem
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
until you get to college and gee we're
 
01:51:27.149 --> 01:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
not going to do anything about college
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
and the reason is that it's all about
 
01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
hormones and it's about hormones that if
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
they go on puberty blockers before they
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
go through puberty um it's we've seen
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
these kids here um there there should
 
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
should be no no super super advantage
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
and just like representative Miler
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
pointed out and people people our age a
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
lot of times what we're thinking of is
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
Boys in drag or men in Drag and it's not
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
guys are not going to put on skirts just
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
to play on girl Sports so um this is a
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
bill that is
 
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination anti-trans that's
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
the only purpose of this bill and um
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's cruel and and that's not something
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
we should do here thank you okay I'm
 
01:52:21.709 --> 01:52:21.719 align:start position:0%
gonna just comment here one more time
 
01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
I wish many of you could have a family
 
01:52:29.790 --> 01:52:29.800 align:start position:0%
where you grow up and watch your your
 
01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
daughters compete and how hard they work
 
01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
and how hard they have tried to excel in
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
in sport be it in high school I saw that
 
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
with the one that went on A&amp;M on a full
 
01:52:46.109 --> 01:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
right scholarship for track and field
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
and that's a tough thing to do at a a a
 
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
school of 44,000 kids
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
and you you talk about
 
01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination I think that without this
 
01:53:00.589 --> 01:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
bill the athlete is being discriminated
 
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
against who has tried and tried and
 
01:53:05.470 --> 01:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
tried and worked so hard over all those
 
01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
years in Middle School grade school
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
middle school high school to to come to
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
the to the top of the Heap but all of a
 
01:53:13.599 --> 01:53:15.510 align:start position:0%
the to the top of the Heap but all of a
sudden

01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
sudden
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
encounter a person of another birth
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
gender that's strong stronger than you
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
are you watch the tournament that I just
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
watched two weeks ago over in Geneva New
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
York Liberty League I watched them play
 
01:53:30.719 --> 01:53:32.109 align:start position:0%
York Liberty League I watched them play
ball

01:53:32.109 --> 01:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
ball
 
01:53:34.629 --> 01:53:34.639 align:start position:0%
boys my grandson who's been scoring
 
01:53:36.510 --> 01:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
about 18 19 points a
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
game sustained in that game a broken
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
nose he also had an ankle injury about
 
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
three weeks prior to that it's a contact
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
sport you put a person of that caliber
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
in amongst girls you are going to have
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
injury we're already having it within
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
the boy
 
01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:00.109 align:start position:0%
the boy
Sports

01:54:00.109 --> 01:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
Sports
 
01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying that that inju should
 
01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
be I I think the ref's got to get on top
 
01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
of it however um when we when we're
 
01:54:10.270 --> 01:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
looking at I'm looking at the
 
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
psychological impact to the girls that
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
worked all their lives to get where they
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
are and then lose the opportunity to
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
reach that goal that theyve strive to do
 
01:54:21.870 --> 01:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
and they got they got it's okay if they
 
01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful if they get beat by
 
01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
another girl that's on that team that's
 
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
what it's all about there be but there
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know if I were to go back and and
 
01:54:33.310 --> 01:54:33.320 align:start position:0%
and quote some of the the sayings from
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
Vince Lombardi and probably many of you
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
don't know remember Vince Lombardi but a
 
01:54:40.189 --> 01:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
wonderful coach over in in in Green Bay
 
01:54:42.069 --> 01:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
there's only one place and that's first
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
place and that's how these girls think
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
and when they're working towards this
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
we're I'm looking at the High Caliber
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
girl and yes you're looking of others
 
01:54:54.109 --> 01:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
that have chosen the opposite
 
01:54:57.510 --> 01:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
gender or are are turn you know gone
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
that way as a
 
01:55:01.229 --> 01:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
transgender and yes there there's
 
01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
psychological impacts there too but
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
there's also discrimination on the other
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
side too and that's what I'm concerned
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
that for we're we're we're forgetting
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
about that youngster the ones that I had
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
grw up in my family and I watched and I
 
01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
watched how hard they worked and they
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
earned what they earned they earned a
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
free ride to college as a result of that
 
01:55:28.750 --> 01:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
ability to be successful on the track or
 
01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:29.870 align:start position:0%
ability to be successful on the track or
in

01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
basketball so I I I think that when we
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
throw things around that we're talking
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
about discrimination here no we're not
 
01:55:38.109 --> 01:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
talking about that we're watching the
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
destruction of Title
 
01:55:43.149 --> 01:55:43.159 align:start position:0%
Nine we're watching that going down the
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
toilet and it is in this
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
country so I think there's
 
01:55:49.149 --> 01:55:49.159 align:start position:0%
misinformation out there and I think
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
it's time we return sport the way it's
 
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:53.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to be run thank you represent
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
cordelli and then represent Damon thank
 
01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
you um I just wanted to go back to line
 
01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
17 and 18 which say athletic teams or
 
01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
Sports designated for females women or
 
01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
girls shall not be open to students of
 
01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
the male sex we're talking about male
 
01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
sex and there's two
 
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
Sexes so this is the male sex um shall
 
01:56:21.149 --> 01:56:21.159 align:start position:0%
not participate on a female or girls
 
01:56:25.069 --> 01:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
team um representative Woodcock raised
 
01:56:28.189 --> 01:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
the issue of um and maybe
 
01:56:28.199 --> 01:56:30.069 align:start position:0%
the issue of um and maybe
female

01:56:30.069 --> 01:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
female
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
um athletes participating on a Mal's
 
01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:35.800 align:start position:0%
team that's their
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
choice they're making a conscious
 
01:56:42.030 --> 01:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
decision knowing that they're playing
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
with uh possibly um male athletes who
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
are bigger and stronger and maybe
 
01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
risking injury they're making that
 
01:56:51.629 --> 01:56:51.639 align:start position:0%
conscious decision and their parents are
 
01:56:55.470 --> 01:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
making that conscious decision um
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
females coming up against a team with a
 
01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:02.270 align:start position:0%
females coming up against a team with a
male

01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
male
 
01:57:06.149 --> 01:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
athlete male sex a
 
01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
transgender um don't are not making that
 
01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:10.669 align:start position:0%
transgender um don't are not making that
conscious

01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
conscious
 
01:57:13.149 --> 01:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
decision they're playing against that
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
team because it's on their
 
01:57:17.790 --> 01:57:17.800 align:start position:0%
schedule they would have to as we talked
 
01:57:19.870 --> 01:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
about they could make the team make the
 
01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
conscious decision and there have been
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
instances where they have chosen not to
 
01:57:29.470 --> 01:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
play that in that uh game because of the
 
01:57:32.189 --> 01:57:32.199 align:start position:0%
situation with the uh transgender
 
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:35.320 align:start position:0%
Athlete on the other team so in lines 17
 
01:57:40.109 --> 01:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
and 18 it's about the male sex and it's
 
01:57:43.229 --> 01:57:43.239 align:start position:0%
about physical injury and the conscious
 
01:57:46.750 --> 01:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:50.109 --> 01:57:50.119 align:start position:0%
thereof rson Damon talking about
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have two things one
 
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
there is a state Regional and National
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
shortage of endocrinologists they are
 
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
not lacking for patients the weit time
 
01:58:03.069 --> 01:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
to get an appointment with an
 
01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
endocrinologist is very lengthy the idea
 
01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:07.669 align:start position:0%
endocrinologist is very lengthy the idea
that

01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:12.069 --> 01:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
those very significantly trained medical
 
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
professionals would provide this care to
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
a person to make money and have a
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
lifetime patient is absurd I'm offended
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
for my colleagues in endocrinology that
 
01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
we would even make a statement like that
 
01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:28.830 align:start position:0%
we would even make a statement like that
here

01:58:28.830 --> 01:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
separately if we are talking about
 
01:58:34.430 --> 01:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
safety in sports we should be talking
 
01:58:37.589 --> 01:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
about safety in men's sports women's
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
sports girls Sports boy Sports anybody's
 
01:58:43.709 --> 01:58:43.719 align:start position:0%
Sports there are lots of injuries in
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
sports I think maybe we need to take a
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
careful look at that whether as part of
 
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
an inter from study for this bill or
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
separately because it is not by any
 
01:58:58.189 --> 01:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
means that this is different this is
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
just another situation in which some
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
students will get hurt students are
 
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
getting hurt anyway and we need to
 
01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:06.910 align:start position:0%
getting hurt anyway and we need to
address

01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:59:09.310 --> 01:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
that okay so what we're going to do and
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go with any more
 
01:59:12.109 --> 01:59:12.119 align:start position:0%

02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
prageru I'll also take this opportunity
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
to add to the record that proper notice
 
02:06:30.430 --> 02:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
was not given to prageru so that
 
02:06:33.149 --> 02:06:33.159 align:start position:0%
Representatives could defend the serious
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
Federal accusations made against them
 
02:06:37.069 --> 02:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
and we should not set a precedent of
 
02:06:39.870 --> 02:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
supporting legislation under these
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances in addition the sponsor
 
02:06:44.109 --> 02:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
admitted to not having completed the
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
videos she objected to in fact no one
 
02:06:50.189 --> 02:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
who testified had completed watching the
 
02:06:52.589 --> 02:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
videos at best this indicates the
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
legislation is unprepared which is the
 
02:06:58.069 --> 02:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
definition of inexpedient to legislate
 
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
but returning to the content of the bill
 
02:07:03.390 --> 02:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
it would be overly generous to say that
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
this is a solution in search of a
 
02:07:08.109 --> 02:07:08.119 align:start position:0%
problem instead the bill creates
 
02:07:11.149 --> 02:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
problems for example we do not know the
 
02:07:13.950 --> 02:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
potential impacts we do not know how
 
02:07:15.790 --> 02:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
many service providers would no longer
 
02:07:19.030 --> 02:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
be options and most importantly we not
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
know how this would adversely impact
 
02:07:23.950 --> 02:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
educational attainment under no
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
circumstances can we support this bill
 
02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
in any form thank you prent luno yes
 
02:07:33.390 --> 02:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair unfortunately while I
 
02:07:37.109 --> 02:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
did second the uh the itl recommendation
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
I disagree with everything that
 
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald just just stated
 
02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
and none of what she said represents um
 
02:07:49.229 --> 02:07:49.239 align:start position:0%
um uh the Democratic position on on um
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
on this bill so with all due respect to
 
02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
the representative and um I would like
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
to request the chair that uh that
 
02:08:00.629 --> 02:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald and I co-write
 
02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
the um the committee report on
 
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
this okay would you like to explain any
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
of the your objections to what
 
02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald was saying or so
 
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
so one of them is that um is that we
 
02:08:16.549 --> 02:08:16.559 align:start position:0%
have another bill uh in play that that I
 
02:08:20.350 --> 02:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
believe better covers the um uh this uh
 
02:08:23.390 --> 02:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
this position with regards to um making
 
02:08:26.549 --> 02:08:26.559 align:start position:0%
sure that uh that programs approved
 
02:08:28.270 --> 02:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
under the what's known as the learn
 
02:08:30.510 --> 02:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
everywhere program comply with state
 
02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
federal and their own um um
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws that
 
02:08:39.149 --> 02:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination policies are good
 
02:08:41.549 --> 02:08:41.559 align:start position:0%
for people all across the United States
 
02:08:45.629 --> 02:08:45.639 align:start position:0%
and and and uh and that um uh that while
 
02:08:48.629 --> 02:08:48.639 align:start position:0%
Public Schools uh certainly and and I
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
think we'd all agree uh have to comply
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
with um and should comply with
 
02:08:56.549 --> 02:08:56.559 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination uh laws that
 
02:09:00.270 --> 02:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
programs that um that are ancillary to
 
02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
Public Schools such as programs approved
 
02:09:04.270 --> 02:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
under the learn
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
everywhere um approved by the state
 
02:09:09.669 --> 02:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
should also be compliant with that and
 
02:09:12.669 --> 02:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
um and for those reasons I think um I
 
02:09:14.709 --> 02:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
think we have another bill that uh that
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
better addresses this better positions
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education to uh to
 
02:09:22.030 --> 02:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
provide oversight into compliance with
 
02:09:24.910 --> 02:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
those uh anti-discrimination policies
 
02:09:27.390 --> 02:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
and um and for those reasons I don't
 
02:09:30.549 --> 02:09:30.559 align:start position:0%
think um 16005 is necessary at this time
 
02:09:33.069 --> 02:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald thank you Mr chair as
 
02:09:34.830 --> 02:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
a representative made a request to
 
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
co-write the committee report I'd humbly
 
02:09:39.510 --> 02:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
request that that does not occur and I
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
have a question for clarification is it
 
02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
possible for two reports be committed if
 
02:09:46.229 --> 02:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
it's the same motion no no it's the same
 
02:09:49.109 --> 02:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
motion you got to work together on it um
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
there were some issues which we had
 
02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
discussed regarding the finances of this
 
02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
the the costs associated with it um and
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
um do only schools of those receiving
 
02:10:02.189 --> 02:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
public funds discriminate there are some
 
02:10:04.270 --> 02:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
several issues which we I think in our
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
discussion ear like that we needed an
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
amendment for clarification on where
 
02:10:10.589 --> 02:10:10.599 align:start position:0%
we're going with various portions of
 
02:10:14.189 --> 02:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
this bill and that it wasn't ready uh so
 
02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.119 align:start position:0%
maybe what we need to do is put this
 
02:10:19.950 --> 02:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
forward for inum stud but try to work on
 
02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:20.950 align:start position:0%
forward for inum stud but try to work on
some

02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:10:23.229 --> 02:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh that we can put into
 
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
the the committee report which comes to
 
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
that Common Ground I think both sides
 
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
are saying we need to do some things
 
02:10:33.709 --> 02:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
with it but uh exactly what is what you
 
02:10:36.750 --> 02:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
we we need to come to some compromise on
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
so so Mr chair I think the motion was
 
02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
itl right oh I thought it was inter
 
02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
study but okay I'm just I back off then
 
02:10:47.709 --> 02:10:47.719 align:start position:0%
okay I mean I certainly support interim
 
02:10:51.310 --> 02:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
study but think you know supporting itl
 
02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
and and U you know I I I I I I certainly
 
02:11:00.229 --> 02:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
think representative McDonald and I can
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
civil work together to put together a um
 
02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh a committee report that that reflects
 
02:11:10.589 --> 02:11:10.599 align:start position:0%
both both the the some of the the
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
positions that um that she's articulated
 
02:11:15.870 --> 02:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
as well as the the positions that I
 
02:11:18.910 --> 02:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
think more reflect um we have done that
 
02:11:20.669 --> 02:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
before we have done that before in bill
 
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
so okay I appreciate I would encourage
 
02:11:24.669 --> 02:11:24.679 align:start position:0%
both of the Reps to get together bang
 
02:11:26.589 --> 02:11:26.599 align:start position:0%
their heads and come up with an NL
 
02:11:28.350 --> 02:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation that's satisfactory to
 
02:11:30.350 --> 02:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
both sides and we don't really have to
 
02:11:32.270 --> 02:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
bang our heads
 
02:11:36.750 --> 02:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
yes be careful so okay so any further
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
discussion on this Phil it's getting
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%

second that sure yes okay thank you very
 
02:13:18.430 --> 02:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
much so we have a recommendation on
 
02:13:22.189 --> 02:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
study on on this bill 1646 relative to
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
Charter Public Schools uh represent luno
 
02:13:26.350 --> 02:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak to your motion sure
 
02:13:28.270 --> 02:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
thanks very much so I think I think the
 
02:13:30.990 --> 02:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
bill was really intended to to go at to
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
some structural deficiencies with the um
 
02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
with how uh Charter Public Schools are
 
02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
are are defined and organized in uh in
 
02:13:44.669 --> 02:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
statute and I think since filing the
 
02:13:47.470 --> 02:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
bill we've received some uh information
 
02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
from the the uh uh jointly from the
 
02:13:51.549 --> 02:13:51.559 align:start position:0%
Department of Education as well as the
 
02:13:54.430 --> 02:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice that U that agrees
 
02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
that there are structural deficiencies
 
02:13:59.549 --> 02:13:59.559 align:start position:0%
to how Charters are are are defined and
 
02:14:02.629 --> 02:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
organized in statute and that uh they
 
02:14:05.549 --> 02:14:05.559 align:start position:0%
would like to um to contribute
 
02:14:08.589 --> 02:14:08.599 align:start position:0%
additional work on this so uh inter
 
02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
study is really the the right place to
 
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
put this for now and um and then we can
 
02:14:16.549 --> 02:14:16.559 align:start position:0%
come forward uh hopefully with a
 
02:14:19.950 --> 02:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
bipartisan um uh Solution that's
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh in in incorporating the
 
02:14:25.589 --> 02:14:25.599 align:start position:0%
um uh the findings that the doj and the
 
02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
doe have thank you representative beler
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I I I tend to
 
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
agree with a fair bit of that um I think
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
we need to look at the the language
 
02:14:36.189 --> 02:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
that's currently existing and determine
 
02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not it is deficient and if we
 
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
do need to fix anything with that I
 
02:14:41.109 --> 02:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
would further note that in this bill as
 
02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
written if passed as is it would appear
 
02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
that there are currently charter schools
 
02:14:47.950 --> 02:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
that would more or less immediately
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
before forc to cease operations come j
 
02:14:51.950 --> 02:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
July 1st which is something that would
 
02:14:54.030 --> 02:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
need to be seriously worked out um in
 
02:14:56.109 --> 02:14:56.119 align:start position:0%
this thank you thank you very much and
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
just to clarify uh the information that
 
02:15:00.910 --> 02:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
I think represent luno and represent
 
02:15:03.870 --> 02:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
belri are familiar with uh we did have
 
02:15:05.950 --> 02:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
communication from uh the Department of
 
02:15:08.629 --> 02:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
Education Caitlyn Davis and Diana Fenton
 
02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
the attorney over there and I'll read
 
02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
one paragraph right here it says we are
 
02:15:14.589 --> 02:15:14.599 align:start position:0%
hoping that this bill could be retained
 
02:15:16.830 --> 02:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
for a study committee as we have
 
02:15:18.750 --> 02:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
recognized that there challenges with
 
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
the incorporation of charter schools
 
02:15:22.750 --> 02:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
that need to be clarified in law but are
 
02:15:26.109 --> 02:15:26.119 align:start position:0%
not not sure exactly what we should seek
 
02:15:27.709 --> 02:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
we have been actively engaged with a
 
02:15:30.149 --> 02:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
charitable trust unit at the AG's office
 
02:15:32.350 --> 02:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
around this endeavor as well and it goes
 
02:15:34.189 --> 02:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
on to speak to some of the issues
 
02:15:37.549 --> 02:15:37.559 align:start position:0%
associated with 501 c3s so there there
 
02:15:41.030 --> 02:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
is a a a a lot of work that we have to
 
02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
do here and in in conjunction with the
 
02:15:45.790 --> 02:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
entire Charter School chapter there and
 
02:15:48.549 --> 02:15:48.559 align:start position:0%
so I think it's wise that we uh interim
 
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
study this and and work with the
 
02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
Department trying to get some of these
 
02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:54.270 align:start position:0%
Department trying to get some of these
areas

02:15:54.270 --> 02:15:54.280 align:start position:0%

I use my comments for right now but um
 
04:09:50.710 --> 04:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
but all this bill does is um is seek to
 
04:09:55.990 --> 04:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
require uh um that programs approved by
 
04:09:57.910 --> 04:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
the state board as part of the learn
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
everywhere program comply with state
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
federal uh uh anti-discrimination laws
 
04:10:05.790 --> 04:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
and have their own anti-discrimination
 
04:10:08.790 --> 04:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
policy that's consistent with um with
 
04:10:10.670 --> 04:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
the structure of
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
354a um you know unlike what we heard
 
04:10:15.550 --> 04:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday from the uh from the
 
04:10:18.510 --> 04:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
Department showing us a list of 800
 
04:10:21.269 --> 04:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
organizations in fact this program only
 
04:10:24.309 --> 04:10:24.319 align:start position:0%
has about 16 organizations I don't think
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's unwieldy or unmanageable to um to
 
04:10:33.109 --> 04:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
to require those organizations to uh to
 
04:10:35.910 --> 04:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
comply and um and further it does not
 
04:10:38.070 --> 04:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
appear that any of the the learn
 
04:10:39.910 --> 04:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere the approved learn everywhere
 
04:10:42.830 --> 04:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
programs were lined up with uh the
 
04:10:45.590 --> 04:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
example that was uh was given yesterday
 
04:10:48.830 --> 04:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
regarding a builder in h Hinsdale so uh
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it would impact um uh
 
04:10:53.870 --> 04:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
that student's particular experience so
 
04:10:55.590 --> 04:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
so uh you know for at least those
 
04:10:59.189 --> 04:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
reasons uh I would oppose the um the itl
 
04:11:00.790 --> 04:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
and I'll look for another
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
motion further discussion from the
 
04:11:08.070 --> 04:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
committee represent cordelli thank you
 
04:11:09.910 --> 04:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
um I I believe also mentioned in
 
04:11:11.149 --> 04:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
addition to learn everywhere there were
 
04:11:13.229 --> 04:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
a couple of other programs and and one
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
that I had found out about um a number
 
04:11:19.149 --> 04:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
of months ago um was related to CTE and
 
04:11:20.910 --> 04:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
it's called work is
 
04:11:23.630 --> 04:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
learning um so I think that there are a
 
04:11:25.229 --> 04:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
number of uh students who are
 
04:11:27.349 --> 04:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
participating in that I I don't have the
 
04:11:30.030 --> 04:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
numbers there but um it's actually a
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:36.790 --> 04:11:36.800 align:start position:0%

anti-discrimination laws whoever that's
 
04:15:20.109 --> 04:15:20.119 align:start position:0%
happened to should go to the Human
 
04:15:21.309 --> 04:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission that's what they're
 
04:15:22.229 --> 04:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
set up
 
04:15:22.239 --> 04:15:24.429 align:start position:0%
set up
for

04:15:24.429 --> 04:15:24.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:15:28.149 --> 04:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
um the State Board of Education asking
 
04:15:34.590 --> 04:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
them to review hundreds of VI of people
 
04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
to make of um often outof State
 
04:15:42.630 --> 04:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
businesses to make sure that they are
 
04:15:46.389 --> 04:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
following this they are volunteers the
 
04:15:48.109 --> 04:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
number of hours that they would be
 
04:15:51.309 --> 04:15:51.319 align:start position:0%
working to have to go and and review
 
04:15:53.269 --> 04:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
every single one because that's part of
 
04:15:56.269 --> 04:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
it shall annually review all Education
 
04:15:59.269 --> 04:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
Service Providers there are what did he
 
04:16:01.469 --> 04:16:01.479 align:start position:0%
say 800 of them or something like that
 
04:16:03.550 --> 04:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
and for to ask these
 
04:16:06.229 --> 04:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
volunteers who are there to spend their
 
04:16:09.309 --> 04:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
time doing something that would was
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
excuse me for a second I cannot hear
 
04:16:13.030 --> 04:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
because of the chattered on that in the
 
04:16:16.309 --> 04:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
table thank you go ahead to ask them to
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
do that is just totally unreasonable and
 
04:16:21.149 --> 04:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
how they would make sure that all of
 
04:16:24.070 --> 04:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
these outstate organizations follow
 
04:16:26.910 --> 04:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
their own
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
um um what is the word I
 
04:16:33.149 --> 04:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
want policy thank you follow their own
 
04:16:38.030 --> 04:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
policies that's just unreasonable so the
 
04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
effect I won't say that that was the
 
04:16:45.309 --> 04:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
intent but the effect is that efas would
 
04:16:48.429 --> 04:16:48.439 align:start position:0%
not be able to use many private entities
 
04:16:53.149 --> 04:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
since the and just and
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
angry thank you very much represent
 
04:16:57.309 --> 04:16:57.319 align:start position:0%

and just like the last bill um if we're
 
04:17:06.990 --> 04:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
able to defeat this motion I'll be
 
04:17:09.790 --> 04:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
making um an alternative motion uh to
 
04:17:12.429 --> 04:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
pass but I'll I'll make my comments
 
04:17:16.149 --> 04:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
right here so in in respect for time but
 
04:17:18.870 --> 04:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
um but in fact um the committee did hear
 
04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
testimony during the hearing yesterday
 
04:17:23.870 --> 04:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
about a number of Education service
 
04:17:28.469 --> 04:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
providers that had discriminatory um
 
04:17:31.070 --> 04:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
quote anti-discrimination policies and
 
04:17:34.510 --> 04:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
and particularly excluded um a number of
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
different um groups um
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
um that um uh I'm sorry CL um classes
 
04:17:44.510 --> 04:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
that are protected under under
 
04:17:47.910 --> 04:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
354a uh specifically um
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
lgbtq and um uh and um and so uh so as
 
04:17:54.910 --> 04:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
such I think there is actually a
 
04:18:00.189 --> 04:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
requirement for um for uh or a need for
 
04:18:02.630 --> 04:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh for Bill such as this to make sure
 
04:18:06.070 --> 04:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
that um that taxpayer dollars are go
 
04:18:08.030 --> 04:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
when when tax or dollars are going
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
towards Educational Services that in
 
04:18:12.790 --> 04:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
fact those services are complying with
 
04:18:15.229 --> 04:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
with our state's um uh
 
04:18:17.950 --> 04:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws so thank you
 
04:18:21.950 --> 04:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you further yes represent leus I
 
04:18:23.670 --> 04:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
will go ahead then and finish what I was
 
04:18:26.109 --> 04:18:26.119 align:start position:0%
starting to say which is according to
 
04:18:30.229 --> 04:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
our state laws um private entities are
 
04:18:34.429 --> 04:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
allowed to discriminate based on certain
 
04:18:39.750 --> 04:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
things and um by making it by this law
 
04:18:43.109 --> 04:18:43.119 align:start position:0%
saying that they that efas then can't
 
04:18:45.670 --> 04:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
use them you're
 
04:18:49.309 --> 04:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
basically saying efas can't use these
 
04:18:51.149 --> 04:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
private entities because the private
 
04:18:54.670 --> 04:18:54.680 align:start position:0%
entities by our state laws are entitled
 
04:18:57.550 --> 04:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
to discriminate based on certain things
 
04:18:57.560 --> 04:18:58.510 align:start position:0%
to discriminate based on certain things
thank

04:18:58.510 --> 04:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:18:58.520 --> 04:19:00.149 align:start position:0%
thank
you

04:19:00.149 --> 04:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:19:04.109 --> 04:19:04.119 align:start position:0%
yes I would say on the reverse of that
 
04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
that people that take efas that are part
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
of the G btq Community are then not
 
04:19:12.710 --> 04:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to make those choices because
 
04:19:14.830 --> 04:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
the school chooses not to allow them to
 
04:19:17.229 --> 04:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
make that choice and school choice is
 
04:19:20.830 --> 04:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
basically with the school not with the
 
04:19:23.309 --> 04:19:23.319 align:start position:0%
student represent driver representa Dr
 
04:19:24.790 --> 04:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
you've had your hand up several time
 
04:19:26.229 --> 04:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
several moments here thank you Mr
 
04:19:27.870 --> 04:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
chairman so I would just direct
 
04:19:31.109 --> 04:19:31.119 align:start position:0%
everybody to 194 F7 the independence of
 
04:19:33.670 --> 04:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
Education Service Providers specifically
 
04:19:35.910 --> 04:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 5 an education service
 
04:19:37.950 --> 04:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
provider should not be required to alter
 
04:19:40.109 --> 04:19:40.119 align:start position:0%
its Creed practices admission policy or
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum in order to accept payments
 
04:19:44.590 --> 04:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
from an EFA the other four sections all
 
04:19:47.830 --> 04:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
talk about how removed this education
 
04:19:50.550 --> 04:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
service provider is from this it's
 
04:19:52.590 --> 04:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
really the interaction is getting the
 
04:19:54.429 --> 04:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
money for that service it's not the
 
04:19:56.990 --> 04:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
provider that's on
 
04:19:59.469 --> 04:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
trial further just represent LE you had
 
04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
your hand up yeah I just wanted to reply
 
04:20:05.030 --> 04:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
to the lgbtq because we did hear that
 
04:20:08.469 --> 04:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
there were numerous as students who were
 
04:20:10.910 --> 04:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
lgbtq who were bullied in the public
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
schools and the EFA is how they got out
 
04:20:16.149 --> 04:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
of the public school to go to a school
 
04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
that was welcoming to them a private
 
04:20:21.229 --> 04:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
school that was welcoming to them so I
 
04:20:23.950 --> 04:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
think using them as an example you
 
04:20:25.590 --> 04:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
better look at the other side of that
 
04:20:27.710 --> 04:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
too further discussion from the
 
04:20:29.429 --> 04:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent
 
04:20:32.590 --> 04:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you I just um have to
 
04:20:35.189 --> 04:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
point out I mean for me the reason I'm
 
04:20:38.550 --> 04:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
here is to see what the impact on kids
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
is um we've heard a lot of numbers that
 
04:20:43.389 --> 04:20:43.399 align:start position:0%
is a little bit confusing here yesterday
 
04:20:46.910 --> 04:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
we heard that there were 800 programs
 
04:20:49.149 --> 04:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
approved and learn everywhere today
 
04:20:52.349 --> 04:20:52.359 align:start position:0%
we're hearing that there are 800 service
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
providers in the EFA
 
04:20:58.269 --> 04:20:58.279 align:start position:0%
program neither one are true there are
 
04:21:01.950 --> 04:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
actually 32 programs in approved
 
04:21:03.950 --> 04:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
programs and they learn
 
04:21:06.510 --> 04:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
everywhere and I had the list of service
 
04:21:09.109 --> 04:21:09.119 align:start position:0%
providers it is not 800 it might be 80
 
04:21:12.429 --> 04:21:12.439 align:start position:0%
85 I'm not sure but the decisions we
 
04:21:14.469 --> 04:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
make today have a direct impact on kids
 
04:21:15.790 --> 04:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
and we should be a little bit more
 
04:21:19.469 --> 04:21:19.479 align:start position:0%
accurate in knowing what really impacts
 
04:21:22.630 --> 04:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
kids and with that information this bill
 
04:21:25.030 --> 04:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
should be on the books it should be OTP
 
04:21:27.030 --> 04:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the
 
04:21:29.469 --> 04:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
committee any further
 
04:21:32.469 --> 04:21:32.479 align:start position:0%

represent beler thank you Mr chair I'll
 
04:24:26.229 --> 04:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
try to be fairly brief but um this goes
 
04:24:28.229 --> 04:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
in very well with a a book that I'm just
 
04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
finishing right now um abigil sh's most
 
04:24:33.550 --> 04:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
recent book bad therapy which
 
04:24:35.630 --> 04:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
incorporates some of what was heard um
 
04:24:38.349 --> 04:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh regarding uh particularly
 
04:24:39.630 --> 04:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
something called that's referred often
 
04:24:42.550 --> 04:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
to as climate anxiety um there has been
 
04:24:45.429 --> 04:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
at this point uh significant movement
 
04:24:48.109 --> 04:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
within uh certain psychological um
 
04:24:52.070 --> 04:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
fields to categorize this uh idea of
 
04:24:54.030 --> 04:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
climate anxiety um it's something that I
 
04:24:56.429 --> 04:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
think is actually probably legitimate
 
04:24:58.269 --> 04:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
and I think based on what we have seen
 
04:24:59.910 --> 04:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
both yesterday even though I wasn't here
 
04:25:01.990 --> 04:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
at the time but also previously in other
 
04:25:04.590 --> 04:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
uh in other testimony that children are
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
having extremely diff ult times around
 
04:25:09.550 --> 04:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
their mental health and one of the big
 
04:25:11.070 --> 04:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
reasons that we've heard is because of
 
04:25:14.429 --> 04:25:14.439 align:start position:0%
they're worried about climate change now
 
04:25:16.670 --> 04:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
I think first of all this is a very uh
 
04:25:19.229 --> 04:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
politically charged issue I think that
 
04:25:20.630 --> 04:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
we need to be keeping generally
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
politically charged issue at schools but
 
04:25:24.149 --> 04:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
even if you don't agree with me on that
 
04:25:26.030 --> 04:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should be inducing
 
04:25:29.830 --> 04:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
climate anxiety in students by putting
 
04:25:31.910 --> 04:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
more of this on them right now when
 
04:25:34.189 --> 04:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
they're young informative and if this is
 
04:25:36.109 --> 04:25:36.119 align:start position:0%
a real problem it's an adult problem to
 
04:25:39.309 --> 04:25:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:42.469 --> 04:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
you further discussion from the second
 
04:25:46.149 --> 04:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um to first of all in in
 
04:25:47.630 --> 04:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
addition to what representative beler
 
04:25:50.229 --> 04:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
said I see this as a local control issue
 
04:25:52.670 --> 04:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
it should be um taken up as part of the
 
04:25:54.469 --> 04:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
science classes the school board can
 
04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
certainly direct their Educators to
 
04:26:02.149 --> 04:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
incorporate climate change and and I
 
04:26:04.109 --> 04:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
certainly see evidence in my local
 
04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
community on a regular basis of climate
 
04:26:09.670 --> 04:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
change education occurring um however
 
04:26:11.710 --> 04:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
I'm also concerned we had two bills
 
04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday this one but preceded it was
 
04:26:16.990 --> 04:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
the bill on masking and we heard
 
04:26:18.870 --> 04:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
significant testimony about the fear
 
04:26:21.469 --> 04:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
that was instilled over during the covid
 
04:26:24.910 --> 04:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
um pandemic era and um I was
 
04:26:26.389 --> 04:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned with the
 
04:26:30.269 --> 04:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
testimony in using this um HR to instill
 
04:26:33.070 --> 04:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
fear particularly of tickborne illnesses
 
04:26:36.349 --> 04:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
with the um increasingly warm Seasons
 
04:26:38.309 --> 04:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
that we will be having and for that
 
04:26:40.550 --> 04:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
reason I will be supporting the it
 
04:26:44.189 --> 04:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
motion further discussion representative
 
04:26:47.469 --> 04:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman I humbly
 
04:26:50.670 --> 04:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
like I disagree with my two other fellow
 
04:26:53.149 --> 04:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh Representatives here I do agree agree
 
04:26:55.910 --> 04:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
with representative Bela talking about
 
04:26:58.870 --> 04:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
that information is uh critical and
 
04:27:01.870 --> 04:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
information is part of the the
 
04:27:06.349 --> 04:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
foundation to provide uh a uh support
 
04:27:08.590 --> 04:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
understanding of climate so I think this
 
04:27:12.590 --> 04:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity hcr3 hc30 rather is just
 
04:27:16.710 --> 04:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
doing that with Dees uh and and U Health
 
04:27:18.990 --> 04:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
and Human Services providing a
 
04:27:22.030 --> 04:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
fundamental Foundation based in science
 
04:27:24.590 --> 04:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
that local as represent perel that local
 
04:27:26.229 --> 04:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
schools have the option this is just
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
providing them options for information
 
04:27:30.269 --> 04:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
uh and I do think it's critical that
 
04:27:32.910 --> 04:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
there's no question it's raining soccer
 
04:27:35.109 --> 04:27:35.119 align:start position:0%
river is up there's no snow for skiing
 
04:27:37.269 --> 04:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
we can't f it it's happening all around
 
04:27:39.910 --> 04:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
us folks I mean so it's it's uh I think
 
04:27:41.309 --> 04:27:41.319 align:start position:0%
we really need to start addressing it
 
04:27:43.269 --> 04:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
the gentleman yesterday who spoke most
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
of the people around here not you
 
04:27:45.950 --> 04:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
Valerie most people around here have
 
04:27:48.349 --> 04:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
gray hair we we Cause part of this we
 
04:27:51.590 --> 04:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
can at least help solve it thank
 
04:27:56.109 --> 04:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
you gray hair huh well
 
04:27:58.790 --> 04:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
some don't have any I just wondering
 
04:28:01.830 --> 04:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:07.149 --> 04:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
here okay um go ahead rep cordello
 
04:28:10.269 --> 04:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so on line 21 it says
 
04:28:13.550 --> 04:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
whereas such curriculum would include an
 
04:28:14.910 --> 04:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement that human activities
 
04:28:16.590 --> 04:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
have caused a crisis we are working to
 
04:28:20.670 --> 04:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
solve today um not everyone believes
 
04:28:22.149 --> 04:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
this and I'm one of them so I will be
 
04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
voting itl I believe that these uh
 
04:28:27.910 --> 04:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
children a lot of whom spoke having this
 
04:28:30.229 --> 04:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
climate change anxiety I think it's
 
04:28:37.870 --> 04:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:40.710 --> 04:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
promulgation of of things that uh I just
 
04:28:42.149 --> 04:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
don't agree
 
04:28:44.389 --> 04:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
with thank you further discussion
 
04:28:44.399 --> 04:28:45.870 align:start position:0%
with thank you further discussion
representative

04:28:45.870 --> 04:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:28:48.389 --> 04:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr
 
04:28:52.109 --> 04:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
chair I'm not quite sure where to begin
 
04:28:55.510 --> 04:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
I find it sad that there wouldn't be
 
04:28:59.790 --> 04:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
more unanimity on this topic there's no
 
04:29:03.590 --> 04:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
cost to The Spill it's about
 
04:29:07.309 --> 04:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
starting better conversation on this we
 
04:29:10.269 --> 04:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
heard from I don't know how many two
 
04:29:10.279 --> 04:29:11.670 align:start position:0%
heard from I don't know how many two
dozen

04:29:11.670 --> 04:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
dozen
 
04:29:14.550 --> 04:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
students students brought the idea for
 
04:29:17.510 --> 04:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
this bill forward to representative
 
04:29:20.269 --> 04:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
Thomas pretending that climate change
 
04:29:22.349 --> 04:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
isn't happening is not going to decrease
 
04:29:23.990 --> 04:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
their anxiety you don't get rid of
 
04:29:27.469 --> 04:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
anxiety by saying oh no it it's nothing
 
04:29:29.189 --> 04:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
to worry about the adults will take care
 
04:29:29.199 --> 04:29:30.309 align:start position:0%
to worry about the adults will take care
of

04:29:30.309 --> 04:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:29:34.189 --> 04:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
it one particular student's remarks her
 
04:29:36.309 --> 04:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
name was Sarah wiro
 
04:29:39.910 --> 04:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
that I noted and I may be
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing but what I understood her
 
04:29:43.950 --> 04:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
to say was students don't know what to
 
04:29:46.750 --> 04:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
do and or they don't think anything they
 
04:29:50.550 --> 04:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
do will be enough about climate
 
04:29:54.750 --> 04:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
issues and the presentation from all of
 
04:29:57.710 --> 04:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
them every single one that they want to
 
04:29:59.950 --> 04:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
learn they want to understand this they
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
are seeing it happen affecting
 
04:30:02.880 --> 04:30:04.630 align:start position:0%
are seeing it happen affecting
agriculture

04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
04:30:07.910 --> 04:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
economy Lifestyles so many
 
04:30:11.550 --> 04:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
things I was so impressed with their
 
04:30:13.950 --> 04:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
work and their concern and I would think
 
04:30:17.109 --> 04:30:17.119 align:start position:0%
we could support them in this representa
 
04:30:18.750 --> 04:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
leus and then representative Tanner and
 
04:30:20.830 --> 04:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
then represent
 
04:30:25.349 --> 04:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
Miler if this was truly a non-political
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
bill and just
 
04:30:30.790 --> 04:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
a what do we know what information is
 
04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
out there what are different scientists
 
04:30:37.710 --> 04:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
saying um I I think they should be
 
04:30:39.510 --> 04:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
looking at what different scientists are
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
sing are there things well some of those
 
04:30:44.510 --> 04:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
things they were talking about was just
 
04:30:46.309 --> 04:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
pollution stuff which certainly we
 
04:30:49.550 --> 04:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
should be dealing with um that's not
 
04:30:52.030 --> 04:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
climate change that's pollution and
 
04:30:54.670 --> 04:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
that's our local environment and we
 
04:30:56.750 --> 04:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
definitely should be and always have
 
04:31:00.830 --> 04:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
been should be dealing with that but
 
04:31:03.389 --> 04:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
um the fact that it starts with an
 
04:31:05.309 --> 04:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement that human activities
 
04:31:08.109 --> 04:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
have caused a crisis and amongst
 
04:31:10.710 --> 04:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
scientists there is a definite
 
04:31:13.630 --> 04:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
disagreement as to how much if any is
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
caused by human activity and how much is
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
caused by greater forces like sunspots
 
04:31:25.429 --> 04:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
like the change in the um not rotation
 
04:31:27.710 --> 04:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
but evolution of the Earth around the
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
Sun based on planetary lineups and stuff
 
04:31:34.710 --> 04:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
like that you know how much is based on
 
04:31:37.990 --> 04:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
volcanoes how how much is based on um
 
04:31:40.109 --> 04:31:40.119 align:start position:0%
the volcanic activity currently along
 
04:31:41.990 --> 04:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
the rim of
 
04:31:45.510 --> 04:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:31:49.469 --> 04:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
southern south of Antarctica
 
04:31:54.670 --> 04:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
Etc and so to start from a point of view
 
04:31:56.750 --> 04:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
a scientific point of view of which
 
04:32:00.710 --> 04:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
there is difference on I think is wrong
 
04:32:03.030 --> 04:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
I I have no problems I think it would be
 
04:32:04.990 --> 04:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
great for kids to learn but they should
 
04:32:08.269 --> 04:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
be learning what various scientists say
 
04:32:12.030 --> 04:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
not just what the accepted by certain
 
04:32:14.070 --> 04:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
people scientists say they should be
 
04:32:15.510 --> 04:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
looking at both
 
04:32:18.750 --> 04:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
sides and I have read many books
 
04:32:21.790 --> 04:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
including by astronauts who have talked
 
04:32:25.790 --> 04:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
about for instance CO2 the fact that the
 
04:32:28.030 --> 04:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
Sahara Desert is shrinking you can see
 
04:32:31.109 --> 04:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
it from space that's because of CO2 and
 
04:32:33.030 --> 04:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
then to have somebody say we're all
 
04:32:35.750 --> 04:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
going to starve because of climate
 
04:32:39.229 --> 04:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
change when CO2 actually greens the
 
04:32:40.950 --> 04:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
Earth and there's a lot of evidence for
 
04:32:45.750 --> 04:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
that Etc the fact that there's
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
conflicting information theories Etc
 
04:32:51.389 --> 04:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
they should
 
04:32:56.550 --> 04:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
be presenting all of those not just
 
04:33:00.389 --> 04:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
this number one here which is a foregone
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
conclusion and that's my objection is
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
that they're starting with a foregone
 
04:33:07.230 --> 04:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
conclusion that has not been proven to
 
04:33:08.830 --> 04:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
that is being
 
04:33:08.840 --> 04:33:10.349 align:start position:0%
that is being
disputed

04:33:10.349 --> 04:33:10.359 align:start position:0%
disputed
 
04:33:14.750 --> 04:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
and um that's my real objection to this
 
04:33:17.230 --> 04:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Tanner thank
 
04:33:19.869 --> 04:33:19.879 align:start position:0%
you thank you I think um as a committee
 
04:33:22.390 --> 04:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
we ought to be very cautious about
 
04:33:24.590 --> 04:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
labeling students that come and talk
 
04:33:28.789 --> 04:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
here as having anxiety uh issues uh I
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
don't think they had climate anxiety
 
04:33:32.990 --> 04:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
issues I think they were uh pretty aware
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
of what was happening and didn't seem to
 
04:33:37.189 --> 04:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
be well I'm not a psychiatrist so I
 
04:33:40.830 --> 04:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
can't diagnose them um my other my other
 
04:33:43.390 --> 04:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
question is uh HR could you this is the
 
04:33:45.910 --> 04:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
first HR we've had in this would you
 
04:33:48.789 --> 04:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
explain uh what it means as far because
 
04:33:50.629 --> 04:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
I think some of the talk was about
 
04:33:53.949 --> 04:33:53.959 align:start position:0%
curriculum and um I don't think this
 
04:33:56.150 --> 04:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
requires curriculum in in schools or
 
04:33:57.910 --> 04:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
anything I was wondering if you could
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
just tell us a little bit about what
 
04:34:03.670 --> 04:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
happens to an HR why why an HR and uh
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
what the requirements are for that
 
04:34:12.349 --> 04:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
please who are you speaking to oh well
 
04:34:14.310 --> 04:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
seeing this as one of the first HRS
 
04:34:15.429 --> 04:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
04:34:19.830 --> 04:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
here um a house resolution does not
 
04:34:22.590 --> 04:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
include it's not a bill so nothing is
 
04:34:24.629 --> 04:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
statutory within this so if that's one
 
04:34:26.510 --> 04:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
point you're looking for although this
 
04:34:28.429 --> 04:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
bill does speak to
 
04:34:30.470 --> 04:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum where if you look at the last
 
04:34:33.750 --> 04:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
whereas it says whereas such curric
 
04:34:36.750 --> 04:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum would include
 
04:34:38.189 --> 04:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
and of course we also know that
 
04:34:40.470 --> 04:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum is a responsibility of the
 
04:34:42.510 --> 04:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
Local District instruction of curriculum
 
04:34:45.590 --> 04:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
as that the statute specifies so but in
 
04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
terms of whether this becomes statutory
 
04:34:49.750 --> 04:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
no it does not where does it
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
go it it's just a resolution of the
 
04:34:54.709 --> 04:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
house and quite truthfully I don't know
 
04:34:56.910 --> 04:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
where it goes probably goes in a c
 
04:34:58.830 --> 04:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
probably goes in a circular file
 
04:34:58.840 --> 04:35:01.510 align:start position:0%
probably goes in a circular file
somewhere

04:35:01.510 --> 04:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
um so we we've had bills of address
 
04:35:06.429 --> 04:35:06.439 align:start position:0%
before I've
 
04:35:08.670 --> 04:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
know I've been aware of the ones that
 
04:35:11.189 --> 04:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
are congressional resolutions you know
 
04:35:13.510 --> 04:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
to to send a letter down to the to
 
04:35:15.629 --> 04:35:15.639 align:start position:0%
Congressional Delegation but I I just
 
04:35:16.949 --> 04:35:16.959 align:start position:0%
don't know where it goes with the house
 
04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
res and everything else um yes I I
 
04:35:23.789 --> 04:35:23.799 align:start position:0%
remember that so represent Miler thank
 
04:35:26.029 --> 04:35:26.039 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair yeah I think the the house
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
resolution is basically uh a statement
 
04:35:31.269 --> 04:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
of intent on the part of the house as
 
04:35:33.949 --> 04:35:33.959 align:start position:0%
far as what it feels about a particular
 
04:35:36.629 --> 04:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
topic so and as the chair says it
 
04:35:38.109 --> 04:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't go anywhere but it basically
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
says this is what we think is a body uh
 
04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
so that's I wasn't G but that's a
 
04:35:48.189 --> 04:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
clarification so my sense here as uh as
 
04:35:50.029 --> 04:35:50.039 align:start position:0%
one of the senior members of this
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
committee um primarily in
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
age um you know it it's amazing to me uh
 
04:36:00.109 --> 04:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know about when you at home but
 
04:36:03.990 --> 04:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
when I see the evidence of uh tornadoes
 
04:36:06.189 --> 04:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
going through Kansas Oklahoma or
 
04:36:10.349 --> 04:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
Missouri or now U Michigan for all all
 
04:36:13.470 --> 04:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
places where I live for 12 years uh or I
 
04:36:15.429 --> 04:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
see the floods that are taking place in
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
California or the uh the 12T snow banks
 
04:36:25.390 --> 04:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
in the sieras or uh the tornadoes and
 
04:36:29.590 --> 04:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
wind I mean to me in my lifetime my wife
 
04:36:32.590 --> 04:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
and I say why is this happening this
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
didn't happen
 
04:36:37.949 --> 04:36:37.959 align:start position:0%
before uh and the the change of climate
 
04:36:41.269 --> 04:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
around this country and the world is is
 
04:36:43.789 --> 04:36:43.799 align:start position:0%
there there's no question about that and
 
04:36:46.429 --> 04:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that it's important
 
04:36:50.310 --> 04:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
for this house to make a statement about
 
04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
that and notwithstanding Whatever
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
anxiety you thought the kids have I
 
04:36:56.910 --> 04:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't here when they were here but um
 
04:36:58.709 --> 04:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
the point is they know this is
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
happening and they want to know why it's
 
04:37:04.029 --> 04:37:04.039 align:start position:0%
happening frankly it's our
 
04:37:06.310 --> 04:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility it's my responsibility as
 
04:37:09.789 --> 04:37:09.799 align:start position:0%
a as as the old Geer in the group to say
 
04:37:12.510 --> 04:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
what did I do that has caused
 
04:37:14.510 --> 04:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
this uh and I take a certain
 
04:37:16.670 --> 04:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility to that for that for my
 
04:37:19.269 --> 04:37:19.279 align:start position:0%
grandkids and so for me the issue of
 
04:37:23.949 --> 04:37:23.959 align:start position:0%
this resolution is merely a statement of
 
04:37:26.990 --> 04:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
position for the house to say we need to
 
04:37:30.070 --> 04:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
look at this and we need to make sure
 
04:37:31.830 --> 04:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
that our students that are out there
 
04:37:34.150 --> 04:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
have some sense of understanding of why
 
04:37:36.310 --> 04:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
is this happening
 
04:37:38.429 --> 04:37:38.439 align:start position:0%
and perhaps as a result of that
 
04:37:41.709 --> 04:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
increased knowledge base they might save
 
04:37:41.719 --> 04:37:42.750 align:start position:0%
increased knowledge base they might save
this

04:37:42.750 --> 04:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:37:44.869 --> 04:37:44.879 align:start position:0%
planet because I'm sure it's hell too
 
04:37:47.470 --> 04:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
old to try to save it right
 
04:37:49.830 --> 04:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
now well let me talk because I'm
 
04:37:52.629 --> 04:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
probably then the next oldest one right
 
04:37:52.639 --> 04:37:54.150 align:start position:0%
probably then the next oldest one right
um

04:37:54.150 --> 04:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:57.150 --> 04:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
so I can remember when I moved to Alaska
 
04:37:59.429 --> 04:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
we' wake up some mornings and that's
 
04:38:01.390 --> 04:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
above the illusion chain we were up on
 
04:38:03.750 --> 04:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
on the Bearing Sea area we'd wake up to
 
04:38:06.590 --> 04:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
minus 40
 
04:38:08.990 --> 04:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
and and of course the folks up that way
 
04:38:11.789 --> 04:38:11.799 align:start position:0%
said well just get used to it and yeah
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
it was hard getting used to it when you
 
04:38:15.070 --> 04:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
go out and get in your Ford 150 pickup
 
04:38:16.709 --> 04:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
truck that has vinyl seats on that are
 
04:38:18.830 --> 04:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
frozen you sit them and they crack and
 
04:38:20.709 --> 04:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
you have a heater block on the engine
 
04:38:22.189 --> 04:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
and the engine's covered over with a
 
04:38:24.349 --> 04:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
blanket and you can start it up yes
 
04:38:26.070 --> 04:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
after you work on it a while but then
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
you can't get the transmission to move
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
at all uh so I I've been through that
 
04:38:33.789 --> 04:38:33.799 align:start position:0%
but I'm also aware of other groups in
 
04:38:35.189 --> 04:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
our world that have gone through to the
 
04:38:38.150 --> 04:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
same thing and if we had the
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative from Lichfield that used
 
04:38:42.390 --> 04:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
to sit on this committee he always used
 
04:38:44.709 --> 04:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
to come forward and say but what about
 
04:38:47.429 --> 04:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
the Vikings back in year
 
04:38:51.269 --> 04:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
1000 and when they went to Iceland then
 
04:38:53.429 --> 04:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
Leaf Ericson and Company come over
 
04:38:55.109 --> 04:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
further and they go to Greenland and
 
04:38:56.789 --> 04:38:56.799 align:start position:0%
then down through Lono Meadows in
 
04:38:59.349 --> 04:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
Northern newfinland down long at coast
 
04:39:02.990 --> 04:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
of Maine why did they leave Greenland
 
04:39:05.629 --> 04:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
well because Greenland was getting
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
cold and so the climate was changing and
 
04:39:11.590 --> 04:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
they had to go back to Iceland and back
 
04:39:13.551 --> 04:39:13.561 align:start position:0%
to Scandinavia they never did really
 
04:39:15.830 --> 04:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
leave Iceland but they did leave the
 
04:39:18.510 --> 04:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
areas in North America and and uh
 
04:39:20.949 --> 04:39:20.959 align:start position:0%
Greenland and that was because there was
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
a change in climate our world has gone
 
04:39:27.150 --> 04:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
through these changes and it's cyclical
 
04:39:29.949 --> 04:39:29.959 align:start position:0%
and so I'm not totally convinced yes I I
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
I see what's happening in the rainforest
 
04:39:33.910 --> 04:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
down in Brazil and when I one of my
 
04:39:35.789 --> 04:39:35.799 align:start position:0%
majors in college was geography and we
 
04:39:39.110 --> 04:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
studied these things um and that's
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
man-made and we can stop that but some
 
04:39:43.948 --> 04:39:43.958 align:start position:0%
other things I think are Beyond us and
 
04:39:46.990 --> 04:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
that so there there all are Cycles so
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
I'll conclude that I'm I'm not really
 
04:39:51.830 --> 04:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely sure that we can control some
 
04:39:53.550 --> 04:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
of this some of this may just be a
 
04:39:57.110 --> 04:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
natural occurrence thank you further
 
04:39:59.788 --> 04:39:59.798 align:start position:0%
disc represent luno thank you very much
 
04:40:03.628 --> 04:40:03.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and and you know I I um I I
 
04:40:05.430 --> 04:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate your acknowledgement that
 
04:40:08.590 --> 04:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
that some of it is man-made um and um
 
04:40:09.788 --> 04:40:09.798 align:start position:0%
and you know something that's been
 
04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
important to me when I talk with people
 
04:40:15.030 --> 04:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
about climate change and obviously I
 
04:40:19.628 --> 04:40:19.638 align:start position:0%
believe um that um that that what we've
 
04:40:23.350 --> 04:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
been doing you know on Earth since the
 
04:40:25.750 --> 04:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
industrial revolution has contributed
 
04:40:28.190 --> 04:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
substantially to the the amassing of
 
04:40:31.310 --> 04:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases and and and carbon
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
dioxide that that has prevent that
 
04:40:36.590 --> 04:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
prevents the uh the Earth from going
 
04:40:38.670 --> 04:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
through its natural cooling but I also
 
04:40:42.310 --> 04:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
recognize as as you've pointed out that
 
04:40:44.430 --> 04:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
over the Millennia there have been
 
04:40:46.948 --> 04:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
cycles that are sometimes thousands or
 
04:40:49.910 --> 04:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of years years long
 
04:40:51.470 --> 04:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
where where there's where there are
 
04:40:54.030 --> 04:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
Heating and Cooling events but to see
 
04:40:58.310 --> 04:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
such sudden um um
 
04:41:03.150 --> 04:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
uh changes in in the earth's climate by
 
04:41:05.310 --> 04:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
degrees degrees
 
04:41:08.550 --> 04:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
over over a period of a decade is
 
04:41:10.270 --> 04:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
nothing like the Earth has ever seen
 
04:41:11.830 --> 04:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
before and I think we've got scientists
 
04:41:15.110 --> 04:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
that have that have that have shown that
 
04:41:17.110 --> 04:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
you can actually see and I don't know if
 
04:41:20.350 --> 04:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
it's in shell rock formations or in the
 
04:41:25.150 --> 04:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
in the uh ice um U cores uh where where
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
the where there's been been melting and
 
04:41:31.150 --> 04:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
um and cooling uh over a long period of
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
time it's never ever been in a short a
 
04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
period of time right now but but going
 
04:41:38.270 --> 04:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
back to what I what I what I like to
 
04:41:40.830 --> 04:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
talk with people about uh about this
 
04:41:44.750 --> 04:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
subject that sometimes reasonable people
 
04:41:48.390 --> 04:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
do disagree on the on the C causes but
 
04:41:51.030 --> 04:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
what is hard to disagree on right now is
 
04:41:53.390 --> 04:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that the climate is
 
04:41:57.270 --> 04:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
changing we might not know absolutely
 
04:41:59.230 --> 04:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
positively sure
 
04:42:01.788 --> 04:42:01.798 align:start position:0%
exactly what is causing it although I
 
04:42:03.190 --> 04:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
think I got a pretty good idea but we
 
04:42:07.110 --> 04:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
might not agree on the part but on the
 
04:42:09.270 --> 04:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
end of on the end of it is there
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
something we can do about it and should
 
04:42:15.070 --> 04:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
we do something about it and and I'm
 
04:42:17.430 --> 04:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
hoping that reasonable people would be
 
04:42:19.990 --> 04:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
able to agree on the first part of that
 
04:42:21.868 --> 04:42:21.878 align:start position:0%
and the last part of that even if we
 
04:42:24.030 --> 04:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
can't come to complete agreement on the
 
04:42:28.788 --> 04:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
middle section the cause of it but but
 
04:42:30.670 --> 04:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
should we is there something we can do
 
04:42:33.150 --> 04:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
about it and should we do something
 
04:42:35.230 --> 04:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
about it and I think that gets to the
 
04:42:39.470 --> 04:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
core of of house resolution 30 uh which
 
04:42:43.030 --> 04:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
is the last sentence in the bill
 
04:42:45.230 --> 04:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
resolved by the house that the general
 
04:42:47.310 --> 04:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
court and by extension the department
 
04:42:48.830 --> 04:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
consider compiling and disseminate
 
04:42:51.628 --> 04:42:51.638 align:start position:0%
climate act education curriculum so that
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
teachers may be prepared to implement
 
04:42:56.750 --> 04:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
climate change education in their
 
04:42:59.270 --> 04:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
classrooms and and it talks about
 
04:43:02.310 --> 04:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
through all these whereases you know how
 
04:43:04.230 --> 04:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
we can become more efficient what jobs
 
04:43:08.830 --> 04:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
are available things that we can do that
 
04:43:14.550 --> 04:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
maybe can slow mitigate or reverse um uh
 
04:43:17.110 --> 04:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
what we've what what has happened over
 
04:43:21.150 --> 04:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
the last decade or decades and um and I
 
04:43:22.990 --> 04:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
think that's what that's what this Bill
 
04:43:25.788 --> 04:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
gets that's what this resolution gets to
 
04:43:27.948 --> 04:43:27.958 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what we heard I
 
04:43:29.270 --> 04:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't here for the whole hearing
 
04:43:31.670 --> 04:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday but we heard from so many
 
04:43:33.670 --> 04:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
young people that that they just like to
 
04:43:36.390 --> 04:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
be empowered to to do something further
 
04:43:38.070 --> 04:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
04:43:40.708 --> 04:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
Damon Mr chair I need a reminder on a
 
04:43:43.510 --> 04:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
procedure question so the sponsor of the
 
04:43:46.150 --> 04:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
bill provided an amendment
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday we have an itl motion so we
 
04:43:50.910 --> 04:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
can't talk about the amendment am I
 
04:43:53.070 --> 04:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
correct about that that's correct so I
 
04:43:55.070 --> 04:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
would respectfully ask my colleagues
 
04:43:57.070 --> 04:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
could we please defeat the itl so we can
 
04:43:59.110 --> 04:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
bring the amendment
 
04:44:02.030 --> 04:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
forward representative belard thank you
 
04:44:03.750 --> 04:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I just wanted to offer a quick
 
04:44:03.760 --> 04:44:05.270 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I just wanted to offer a quick
clarification

04:44:05.270 --> 04:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
04:44:07.230 --> 04:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
um on something that was said earlier I
 
04:44:09.310 --> 04:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
I certainly from my chair here would not
 
04:44:11.788 --> 04:44:11.798 align:start position:0%
presume to diagnose a member of the
 
04:44:13.788 --> 04:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
public offering testimony with with some
 
04:44:17.070 --> 04:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a mental health condition I do
 
04:44:19.070 --> 04:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
think that ABS in a good reason to
 
04:44:21.150 --> 04:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
disbelieve them though when they tell us
 
04:44:23.110 --> 04:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
something we should take them at their
 
04:44:25.230 --> 04:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
word so when children come to this
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
committee as they have and they tell us
 
04:44:29.470 --> 04:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
Point Blank that they are experiencing
 
04:44:31.788 --> 04:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
climate anxiety and that because of what
 
04:44:33.670 --> 04:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
they have learned about the climate that
 
04:44:36.030 --> 04:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
they believe the world is ending we have
 
04:44:38.070 --> 04:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
heard that in this committee that is
 
04:44:41.708 --> 04:44:41.718 align:start position:0%
causing mental health problems to them I
 
04:44:43.350 --> 04:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
think it's perfectly reasonable to take
 
04:44:45.070 --> 04:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
them at their word on that and I think
 
04:44:47.750 --> 04:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
we should respect
 
04:44:52.230 --> 04:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
that yes represent MCD thank you
 
04:44:54.788 --> 04:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
representative my primary objection with
 
04:44:57.628 --> 04:44:57.638 align:start position:0%
this is that it is a resolution and not
 
04:45:01.470 --> 04:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
a bill because the resolution is
 
04:45:04.350 --> 04:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
encouraging both the department of
 
04:45:06.350 --> 04:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
education and environmental services to
 
04:45:08.788 --> 04:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
develop a curriculum but the language is
 
04:45:10.990 --> 04:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
vague throughout the resolution to
 
04:45:13.110 --> 04:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
include the title so we're en
 
04:45:15.510 --> 04:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
encouraging them to develop a curriculum
 
04:45:17.868 --> 04:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
but not outlining what the curriculum is
 
04:45:20.030 --> 04:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
nor setting an appropriation for it
 
04:45:21.670 --> 04:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
because again this is a resolution and
 
04:45:23.550 --> 04:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
resolutions are not bills and bills set
 
04:45:25.670 --> 04:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
Appropriations resolutions cannot to the
 
04:45:28.830 --> 04:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
best of my knowledge so stepping away
 
04:45:31.390 --> 04:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
from the climate issue I do not believe
 
04:45:33.670 --> 04:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
this is the vehicle to move anything
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
forward but I'd like to tell the
 
04:45:37.350 --> 04:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
students we duly note their concerns and
 
04:45:39.070 --> 04:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
maybe we can work together in a
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
bipartisan way to bring something
 
04:45:43.030 --> 04:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
forward that isn't a resolution or at
 
04:45:46.110 --> 04:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
least not this one at this
 
04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
time thank you are there yes
 
04:45:51.430 --> 04:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative Drive you've had your
 
04:45:54.030 --> 04:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
hand up a little bit here thank you um I
 
04:45:55.430 --> 04:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
I would like to build on to what
 
04:45:57.948 --> 04:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald said except to
 
04:45:59.628 --> 04:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
politely point out that the Department
 
04:46:01.470 --> 04:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
of Education or trans education
 
04:46:03.708 --> 04:46:03.718 align:start position:0%
committee is not included in this
 
04:46:06.150 --> 04:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
resolution at all and I believe this is
 
04:46:08.470 --> 04:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
not the vehicle for it if you want to
 
04:46:10.150 --> 04:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
talk about curriculum let's talk about
 
04:46:12.788 --> 04:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
curriculum but let's talk about where
 
04:46:15.230 --> 04:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
where the suggestion came from the other
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
day and I'm looking at the website of
 
04:46:21.390 --> 04:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
the 350 NH youth team which uh Champions
 
04:46:23.708 --> 04:46:23.718 align:start position:0%
Progressive climate policy and supports
 
04:46:26.150 --> 04:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
candidates who do that so I'm
 
04:46:29.070 --> 04:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if we're going to get a
 
04:46:32.070 --> 04:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
balanced curriculum out of this
 
04:46:35.070 --> 04:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
represent Leon represent woodcock
 
04:46:36.708 --> 04:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to
 
04:46:38.750 --> 04:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
address the whether or not we should
 
04:46:42.430 --> 04:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
look at the amendment because the
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
objection is also in the amendment they
 
04:46:47.708 --> 04:46:47.718 align:start position:0%
left one in and one is what we're
 
04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
objecting to so I don't see that that
 
04:46:54.190 --> 04:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
will help any represent Woodcock thank
 
04:46:56.708 --> 04:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
you CH live um I go back to the basic
 
04:47:01.948 --> 04:47:01.958 align:start position:0%
premise uh I was um completely uh uh
 
04:47:03.948 --> 04:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
satisfied and happy and excited actually
 
04:47:06.948 --> 04:47:06.958 align:start position:0%

04:47:10.070 --> 04:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
Schools students from Public Schools
 
04:47:13.470 --> 04:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
students from school clubs schools uh
 
04:47:15.110 --> 04:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
and school environmental science classes
 
04:47:17.670 --> 04:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
come together from all over the state
 
04:47:20.310 --> 04:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
saying please just acknow give us some
 
04:47:22.510 --> 04:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
help here and all we're saying is let us
 
04:47:24.670 --> 04:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
bring this forward and say Department of
 
04:47:26.670 --> 04:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and Department
 
04:47:28.470 --> 04:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services because
 
04:47:30.948 --> 04:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
they've done this before ask please help
 
04:47:33.830 --> 04:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
us to have government do something give
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
them the option to start working for us
 
04:47:37.830 --> 04:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
to provide this information it doesn't
 
04:47:40.470 --> 04:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
say any school district has to accept it
 
04:47:42.470 --> 04:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't outline what particular pie
 
04:47:44.350 --> 04:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
they're saying here we see a problem
 
04:47:46.110 --> 04:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
we're the coming youth of of the country
 
04:47:47.708 --> 04:47:47.718 align:start position:0%
we came to the place that's supposed to
 
04:47:50.510 --> 04:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
be helping democracy education commit
 
04:47:52.390 --> 04:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
education that's all we're asking for
 
04:47:54.030 --> 04:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's really simple it's
 
04:47:56.030 --> 04:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's and and as you said Mr sheer when
 
04:47:58.110 --> 04:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
they ask where do it go from here it may
 
04:48:00.390 --> 04:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
end up in that circular file but at
 
04:48:01.708 --> 04:48:01.718 align:start position:0%
least we've done our part and put it
 
04:48:03.310 --> 04:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
forward to say yeah we acknowledge kids
 
04:48:05.150 --> 04:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
you're asking for help we're try to put
 
04:48:06.948 --> 04:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
you give us a direction we'll try to
 
04:48:09.430 --> 04:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
follow it thank you let me respond a
 
04:48:13.070 --> 04:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
little bit to this that within this bill
 
04:48:14.470 --> 04:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
or this
 
04:48:17.310 --> 04:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
resolution if you look down on some of
 
04:48:20.628 --> 04:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
the uh statements which are made on
 
04:48:22.830 --> 04:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
lines 24 on
 
04:48:25.150 --> 04:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
downwards when they say including
 
04:48:26.948 --> 04:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
elements of the Industrial Revolution
 
04:48:29.310 --> 04:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
fine that's that's great but when they
 
04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
they start talking about deliberate
 
04:48:35.310 --> 04:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
misinformation campaigns by big
 
04:48:38.750 --> 04:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
oil it start you know I'm a kind of an
 
04:48:40.310 --> 04:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
oil guy that comes from
 
04:48:43.548 --> 04:48:43.558 align:start position:0%
Alaska and and gas C companies to
 
04:48:45.708 --> 04:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
misinform the public about the effects
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
of climate
 
04:48:49.470 --> 04:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
change I think this is clearly a
 
04:48:49.480 --> 04:48:51.390 align:start position:0%
change I think this is clearly a
political

04:48:51.390 --> 04:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
political
 
04:48:53.948 --> 04:48:53.958 align:start position:0%
message and that that that bothers me
 
04:48:56.430 --> 04:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
that then we're as the as the house
 
04:48:58.670 --> 04:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
we're being asked to pass a
 
04:49:02.548 --> 04:49:02.558 align:start position:0%
resolution that's saying that
 
04:49:05.190 --> 04:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
deliberately Miss information campaign
 
04:49:07.510 --> 04:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
liberate misinformation campaigns
 
04:49:10.190 --> 04:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
regarding fossil
 
04:49:13.310 --> 04:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
fuels uh I I think that that's you
 
04:49:17.510 --> 04:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
know putting this on it is certainly not
 
04:49:20.070 --> 04:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
fair and balanced as represent dry was
 
04:49:21.990 --> 04:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
trying to to say or
 
04:49:24.270 --> 04:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
state earlier with our comments
 
04:49:24.280 --> 04:49:25.430 align:start position:0%
state earlier with our comments
representative

04:49:25.430 --> 04:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:49:27.750 --> 04:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
Damon if I could just respond to that
 
04:49:30.868 --> 04:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
concern Mr chair the amendment changes
 
04:49:32.708 --> 04:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
that language and specifically says a
 
04:49:34.510 --> 04:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
balanced historical back background on
 
04:49:36.030 --> 04:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
the innovations that led to the
 
04:49:38.390 --> 04:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
Discovery and use of fossil fuels and
 
04:49:41.070 --> 04:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
goes on and lists other things but I
 
04:49:43.230 --> 04:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
think I think they did recognize that
 
04:49:48.670 --> 04:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
the way that that was um phrased was not
 
04:49:51.270 --> 04:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate um and to me balanced
 
04:49:52.750 --> 04:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
historical background that's exactly
 
04:49:54.390 --> 04:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
what we should be providing students on
 
04:49:54.400 --> 04:49:55.948 align:start position:0%
what we should be providing students on
every

04:49:55.948 --> 04:49:55.958 align:start position:0%
every
 
04:49:58.470 --> 04:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
topic further discussion represent
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
cordelli Ju Just to follow on that um uh
 
04:50:06.310 --> 04:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
I also see on page two the local case
 
04:50:09.948 --> 04:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
studies um do not look balanced to me
 
04:50:12.190 --> 04:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
and uh I certainly if you wanted to have
 
04:50:13.628 --> 04:50:13.638 align:start position:0%
a balanced approach you could take a
 
04:50:16.350 --> 04:50:16.360 align:start position:0%
look at the failure of offshore wind
 
04:50:19.070 --> 04:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
leasing um off the coast of New
 
04:50:22.788 --> 04:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
Jersey um and uh up above that I'm not
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:31.350 --> 04:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
is further discussion from the committee
 
04:50:34.310 --> 04:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
on the bill here or on the resolution
 
04:50:36.390 --> 04:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
yes represent cascaden just have to add
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
my two cents you don't
 
04:50:41.110 --> 04:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
mind um I just have to relay this
 
04:50:43.270 --> 04:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
information so a little over 10 years
 
04:50:45.670 --> 04:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
ago I started my doctoral study the
 
04:50:47.830 --> 04:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
first book in the first course was
 
04:50:50.670 --> 04:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
called futuring and we had to look at
 
04:50:52.830 --> 04:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
all of the scientific
 
04:50:56.190 --> 04:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
evidence on this particular topic that
 
04:50:59.510 --> 04:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
was over 10 years ago now so obviously
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
it had a tension then
 
04:51:07.150 --> 04:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
um after spending over 40 years 180 days
 
04:51:10.670 --> 04:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
a year with hundreds of kids every
 
04:51:13.510 --> 04:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
single day many have anxiety over a
 
04:51:15.990 --> 04:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
number of things write down a climate
 
04:51:19.270 --> 04:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
anxiety if they're going to miss recess
 
04:51:22.110 --> 04:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
I have anxiety if the notch is going to
 
04:51:26.390 --> 04:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
close um I think we're overthinking this
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
we need to step back and look at the
 
04:51:30.628 --> 04:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
message these kids are trying to give I
 
04:51:33.230 --> 04:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
don't want those kids to say in five
 
04:51:36.030 --> 04:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
years yeah so and so on that
 
04:51:39.628 --> 04:51:39.638 align:start position:0%
committee denied it we're not giving
 
04:51:42.830 --> 04:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
them permission to change anything we're
 
04:51:44.910 --> 04:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
giving them
 
04:51:48.390 --> 04:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
validation for what they believe is
 
04:51:50.708 --> 04:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
occurring and they will continue to
 
04:51:50.718 --> 04:51:52.190 align:start position:0%
occurring and they will continue to
study

04:51:52.190 --> 04:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
study
 
04:51:54.590 --> 04:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
it I don't know why we're just keep
 
04:51:54.600 --> 04:51:56.270 align:start position:0%
it I don't know why we're just keep
beating

04:51:56.270 --> 04:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
beating
 
04:51:59.270 --> 04:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
this I was support the kids anything
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
kids do bar surpasses what adults could
 
04:52:04.590 --> 04:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
do I I I remember coming from your neck
 
04:52:07.070 --> 04:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
of the woods up there in runford and and
 
04:52:09.510 --> 04:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
Berlin and you had Brown Paper Company
 
04:52:11.948 --> 04:52:11.958 align:start position:0%
weighed the Oxford and my father in-law
 
04:52:13.948 --> 04:52:13.958 align:start position:0%
who was an engineer in nor Eastern grad
 
04:52:15.948 --> 04:52:15.958 align:start position:0%
used to say to me Rick don't worry about
 
04:52:19.030 --> 04:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:19.040 --> 04:52:22.470 align:start position:0%
 
money

04:52:22.470 --> 04:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:27.788 --> 04:52:27.798 align:start position:0%
and represent cordelli um thank you I
 
04:52:31.150 --> 04:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
certainly enjoy seeing the kids here but
 
04:52:34.190 --> 04:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
um you know I I don't think that every
 
04:52:36.628 --> 04:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
um opinion from a group of students
 
04:52:40.230 --> 04:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
brought to us requires us to um fall in
 
04:52:42.350 --> 04:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
line and pass legislation that they're
 
04:52:45.708 --> 04:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
asking for um and the same goes for even
 
04:52:49.190 --> 04:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
some of the um bills put forth by uh
 
04:52:52.670 --> 04:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
fourth grade classes about um the state
 
04:52:55.628 --> 04:52:55.638 align:start position:0%
Jumping Frog or Jumping Frog license
 
04:52:58.030 --> 04:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
plates um you know I don't think you
 
04:52:59.868 --> 04:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
know we need to follow all that
 
04:53:02.868 --> 04:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
direction just because it's kids um you
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
know you know maybe we should get some
 
04:53:08.270 --> 04:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
senior groups in here to uh pres present
 
04:53:09.868 --> 04:53:09.878 align:start position:0%
opinions also they're already here
 
04:53:09.878 --> 04:53:11.190 align:start position:0%
opinions also they're already here
they're

04:53:11.190 --> 04:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:53:16.150 --> 04:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
here boy I I walked into that one didn't
 
04:53:18.470 --> 04:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
I represent Damon you have your hand up
 
04:53:20.310 --> 04:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
again I
 
04:53:24.750 --> 04:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
do so I'm sure we don't like do a straw
 
04:53:28.628 --> 04:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
pole but I appreciate that there are
 
04:53:31.430 --> 04:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
concerns about the specific language in
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
this bill in fact it's a lengthy
 
04:53:36.150 --> 04:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
resolution with a lot of
 
04:53:39.470 --> 04:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
specificity so I'm wondering if there is
 
04:53:39.480 --> 04:53:40.590 align:start position:0%
specificity so I'm wondering if there is
an

04:53:40.590 --> 04:53:40.600 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:53:43.190 --> 04:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
appetite bipartisan I've heard several
 
04:53:45.190 --> 04:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
folks say they would be willing to work
 
04:53:45.200 --> 04:53:46.190 align:start position:0%
folks say they would be willing to work
on

04:53:46.190 --> 04:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:53:48.510 --> 04:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
this is there some way for us to not
 
04:53:52.150 --> 04:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
vote on this today and collaboratively
 
04:53:59.430 --> 04:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
resolution we do have a motion on the
 
04:54:02.480 --> 04:54:05.948 align:start position:0%
resolution we do have a motion on the
table

04:54:05.948 --> 04:54:05.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:08.470 --> 04:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
so with that what I'm going to do is go
 
04:54:10.750 --> 04:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
through the taking action on that motion
 
04:54:13.270 --> 04:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
we we're running out of time here and I
 
04:54:16.270 --> 04:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
I I realize you know uh your what your
 
04:54:20.070 --> 04:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
request is so if there's no more
 
04:54:21.590 --> 04:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
discussion on this we're going to move
 
04:54:24.230 --> 04:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
forward with the
 
04:54:28.390 --> 04:54:28.400 align:start position:0%

lines 13 um when the on the amendment it
 
04:59:31.270 --> 04:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:34.190 --> 04:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
Education represent tner
 
04:59:36.750 --> 04:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
when we did the Civics Civics did that
 
04:59:38.030 --> 04:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
go through the Department of Education
 
04:59:41.788 --> 04:59:41.798 align:start position:0%
or was that an independent the Civics
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum are you talking about the
 
04:59:46.750 --> 04:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
textbook no the Civics model curriculum
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's that came by way of a bill yes
 
04:59:51.628 --> 04:59:51.638 align:start position:0%
under studies right but was that that
 
04:59:52.948 --> 04:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
wasn't through the Department of
 
04:59:55.030 --> 04:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
Education that was through a committee
 
04:59:57.390 --> 04:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
right an independent committee no that
 
04:59:59.350 --> 04:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
bill specifically said there would be a
 
05:00:02.270 --> 05:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
half CR a credit in the Middle School
 
05:00:04.230 --> 05:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
Credit and half Credit in the U High
 
05:00:07.030 --> 05:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
School for the teaching of civics um it
 
05:00:11.670 --> 05:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
didn't change the the uh the uh academic
 
05:00:13.708 --> 05:00:13.718 align:start position:0%
standards for social studies at all and
 
05:00:15.628 --> 05:00:15.638 align:start position:0%
it didn't lay out a specific curriculum
 
05:00:17.110 --> 05:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
either right and that's not what I'm
 
05:00:19.070 --> 05:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
talking about I'm talking about a model
 
05:00:21.270 --> 05:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
Civics curriculum that we in the past
 
05:00:24.628 --> 05:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
we've had people that have have put out
 
05:00:27.190 --> 05:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
model curriculum that people can use or
 
05:00:29.350 --> 05:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
not use that hasn't necessarily been
 
05:00:31.150 --> 05:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
developed by the Department of Education
 
05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:40.030 --> 05:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
I and Civics is one of them I'm not
 
05:00:42.750 --> 05:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
recalling a model curriculum in Civics
 
05:00:44.670 --> 05:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
we had a model curriculum which I had
 
05:00:47.548 --> 05:00:47.558 align:start position:0%
gotten from the state of Ohio or the
 
05:00:50.190 --> 05:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and the Holocaust we were
 
05:00:52.590 --> 05:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
working with the Holocaust Center over
 
05:00:54.670 --> 05:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
in Keen State College it's not through
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education necessarily
 
05:00:59.190 --> 05:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
but that that there's a commission or a
 
05:01:01.230 --> 05:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
committee a commission working on that
 
05:01:03.350 --> 05:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
right now right that's that's
 
05:01:05.390 --> 05:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's what I mean just the fact that
 
05:01:07.070 --> 05:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education is not part
 
05:01:11.470 --> 05:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
of this resolution is Not Unusual it's
 
05:01:13.670 --> 05:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
it it's happened before it happens with
 
05:01:16.548 --> 05:01:16.558 align:start position:0%
the Holocaust studies it happens I
 
05:01:19.350 --> 05:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
pretty sure with the Civic studies um
 
05:01:20.788 --> 05:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
but but with with with with the
 
05:01:23.590 --> 05:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
Holocaust it's also a part of adequacy
 
05:01:25.590 --> 05:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
we have that underneath as one of those
 
05:01:28.470 --> 05:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
topical areas a substant criteria for an
 
05:01:30.350 --> 05:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
adequate education Holocaust is
 
05:01:30.360 --> 05:01:31.830 align:start position:0%
adequate education Holocaust is
specifically

05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
05:01:31.840 --> 05:01:34.310 align:start position:0%
specifically
mentioned

05:01:34.310 --> 05:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
05:01:36.270 --> 05:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
they don't have to use the curriculum
 
05:01:40.070 --> 05:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
developed I I have not seen a curriculum
 
05:01:42.548 --> 05:01:42.558 align:start position:0%
on the Holocaust come out of that group
 
05:01:45.948 --> 05:01:45.958 align:start position:0%
yet so there's nothing brought back for
 
05:01:48.510 --> 05:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
consideration either as part of the
 
05:01:49.830 --> 05:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
minim standards for public school
 
05:01:51.948 --> 05:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
approval are the academic standards I I
 
05:01:53.390 --> 05:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
haven't seen
 
05:01:56.350 --> 05:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
it representer Cornell I don't remember
 
05:01:58.390 --> 05:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday any of the presenters
 
05:02:00.270 --> 05:02:00.280 align:start position:0%
mentioning the Department of Education
 
05:02:03.628 --> 05:02:03.638 align:start position:0%
when they were presenting the um hr30
 
05:02:05.830 --> 05:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
they said the Department of Health and
 
05:02:09.390 --> 05:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
Human Services and the Department of
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
Environmental I think that's in the
 
05:02:14.390 --> 05:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
original but I there were two of us that
 
05:02:15.948 --> 05:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
weren't here and I don't think
 
05:02:17.350 --> 05:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative Heath was here at that
 
05:02:18.788 --> 05:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
time either we were all busy down the
 
05:02:21.350 --> 05:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
end of the hall dealing with that
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
Finance uh yeah represent I was just
 
05:02:25.948 --> 05:02:25.958 align:start position:0%
merely pointing out that that was one of
 
05:02:27.910 --> 05:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
the differences between the original
 
05:02:29.670 --> 05:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment I didn't need to
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
go down this road I just wanted to point
 
05:02:36.310 --> 05:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:39.590 --> 05:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay yes represent Woodcock not the beli
 
05:02:42.910 --> 05:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
just the represent pel's Point um it's
 
05:02:45.030 --> 05:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
clear uh that the department of
 
05:02:47.910 --> 05:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
education does not have the staff to
 
05:02:50.030 --> 05:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
continue to update curriculum across the
 
05:02:52.310 --> 05:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
agenda uh as was pointed out yesterday
 
05:02:54.430 --> 05:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
by the commissioner talking about math
 
05:02:57.270 --> 05:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
and science and math in English 2014 the
 
05:02:59.670 --> 05:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
most recent time they did it um and we
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
all know not anyone's fault they just
 
05:03:03.470 --> 05:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
not a staff they to do it so it's not
 
05:03:05.270 --> 05:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
surprising the do is not in this as
 
05:03:07.510 --> 05:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum developers anyhow cuz it's
 
05:03:11.070 --> 05:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
just subject thank you just just to tag
 
05:03:13.470 --> 05:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
on that a little bit yes the curriculum
 
05:03:14.708 --> 05:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
department at the Department of
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
Education has basically been raped uh
 
05:03:19.750 --> 05:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
over the years we've just lost Personnel
 
05:03:22.190 --> 05:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
over there and it's you know I've been
 
05:03:23.830 --> 05:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
in districts that have more curriculum
 
05:03:25.708 --> 05:03:25.718 align:start position:0%
staff than our department of education
 
05:03:28.030 --> 05:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
has in the state the way we've developed
 
05:03:29.708 --> 05:03:29.718 align:start position:0%
curriculum is through task force that
 
05:03:32.190 --> 05:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
are brought together they come down and
 
05:03:33.390 --> 05:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
work with with the Department of
 
05:03:35.470 --> 05:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
Education and then make a recommendation
 
05:03:36.628 --> 05:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
at the end of
 
05:03:40.190 --> 05:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
that I appreciate that thank you
 
05:03:42.788 --> 05:03:42.798 align:start position:0%
yeah further discussion we have an
 
05:03:45.750 --> 05:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of us a motion for

05:35:53.270 --> 05:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with theou process
 
05:35:55.470 --> 05:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
correct yes and
 
05:35:57.868 --> 05:35:57.878 align:start position:0%
so can you just give us a brief
 
05:36:00.030 --> 05:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
rationale why we put at the start start
 
05:36:02.070 --> 05:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
of the school year vers November one and
 
05:36:05.548 --> 05:36:05.558 align:start position:0%
why November 1 maybe vers October 1 sure
 
05:36:07.190 --> 05:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
so every school district has been
 
05:36:11.430 --> 05:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
charged with um getting anou to the um
 
05:36:13.430 --> 05:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
public charter schools and the
 
05:36:15.910 --> 05:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
department of Ed has given us a template
 
05:36:19.470 --> 05:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
um to do that um originally July was the
 
05:36:21.510 --> 05:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
um deadline to get that all signed
 
05:36:23.788 --> 05:36:23.798 align:start position:0%
sealed and delivered during um the
 
05:36:26.628 --> 05:36:26.638 align:start position:0%
summer often times um there there aren't
 
05:36:29.430 --> 05:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks at the charter schools um
 
05:36:31.670 --> 05:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
and so there's been a few challenges in
 
05:36:34.670 --> 05:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
terms of meeting that deadline um moving
 
05:36:37.070 --> 05:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
the deadline to the fall would certainly
 
05:36:38.948 --> 05:36:38.958 align:start position:0%
help I think the charter schools as well
 
05:36:42.750 --> 05:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
as the leas um in getting um the not
 
05:36:44.510 --> 05:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
just the signatures but getting all the
 
05:36:49.270 --> 05:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
essential information into those uh M
 
05:36:52.708 --> 05:36:52.718 align:start position:0%
us so in terms of the these children or
 
05:36:56.030 --> 05:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
students which are coming uh it's just
 
05:36:58.030 --> 05:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
at a start right now and of course we
 
05:37:00.470 --> 05:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
don't know what it really looks like at
 
05:37:01.868 --> 05:37:01.878 align:start position:0%
the charter school there may be a number
 
05:37:05.670 --> 05:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
of kids that moved in with
 
05:37:07.868 --> 05:37:07.878 align:start position:0%
IEPs what what's the rational having
 
05:37:10.150 --> 05:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
Waits so long from the start to November
 
05:37:13.070 --> 05:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
one vers let's say to October 1 when the
 
05:37:15.310 --> 05:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
school submits its enrollment data to
 
05:37:18.070 --> 05:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
the state department I think it's when
 
05:37:19.868 --> 05:37:19.878 align:start position:0%
kids are enrolled at least this is my
 
05:37:21.310 --> 05:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
understanding in in the charter schools
 
05:37:23.910 --> 05:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's up to the parents to to notify the
 
05:37:26.350 --> 05:37:26.360 align:start position:0%
charter school that the child has an
 
05:37:29.310 --> 05:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
IEP um and and then get that information
 
05:37:31.510 --> 05:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
commun communicate that to the school
 
05:37:33.708 --> 05:37:33.718 align:start position:0%
district sometimes the parents do notify
 
05:37:36.310 --> 05:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
the leas so there at times there's a a
 
05:37:39.190 --> 05:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
gap in terms of even knowing um that a
 
05:37:42.110 --> 05:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
student with an IEP is even at a charter
 
05:37:45.190 --> 05:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
school the district isn't necessarily
 
05:37:47.990 --> 05:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
notified right away um and I'm sure
 
05:37:51.070 --> 05:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of reasons for that um
 
05:37:52.708 --> 05:37:52.718 align:start position:0%
but this would you know putting the
 
05:37:55.948 --> 05:37:55.958 align:start position:0%
deadline up would give ample time to um
 
05:37:58.310 --> 05:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know ensure that everything in
 
05:38:01.030 --> 05:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
thatou is is signed sealed and delivered
 
05:38:03.350 --> 05:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
and that includes everything from who's
 
05:38:05.470 --> 05:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
going to deliver the services to how
 
05:38:07.150 --> 05:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
much it's going to cost when it's going
 
05:38:09.230 --> 05:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
to happen who the you know what the
 
05:38:11.750 --> 05:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
credentials are of the individuals
 
05:38:13.110 --> 05:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes in the summer you don't even
 
05:38:15.868 --> 05:38:15.878 align:start position:0%
know some of that information yet um so
 
05:38:17.830 --> 05:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
it would give folks the time to get
 
05:38:19.430 --> 05:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
those details
 
05:38:23.110 --> 05:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
right represent Luna thank thanks very
 
05:38:25.110 --> 05:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
much and and thanks Jane for being able
 
05:38:27.670 --> 05:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
for sticking with us all day on this
 
05:38:30.830 --> 05:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the um the Theus and
 
05:38:33.310 --> 05:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
the delivery of services and yeah I
 
05:38:36.230 --> 05:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
understand that that that you know um
 
05:38:38.310 --> 05:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
students with with
 
05:38:42.190 --> 05:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
IEPs every I is you know is a little
 
05:38:45.548 --> 05:38:45.558 align:start position:0%
different um um but as far as the mou
 
05:38:48.070 --> 05:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
are concerned and delivery of services
 
05:38:51.190 --> 05:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
do those change dramatically from year
 
05:38:55.030 --> 05:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
to year between um a a school district
 
05:38:58.270 --> 05:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
and a and a and a charter or delivery of
 
05:39:00.830 --> 05:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
most of the services already defined in
 
05:39:02.910 --> 05:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
thatou yeah I don't think there's a huge
 
05:39:03.948 --> 05:39:03.958 align:start position:0%
amount of change because it's not
 
05:39:07.070 --> 05:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
student specific in theou it talks about
 
05:39:09.510 --> 05:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
who's going to deliver the services when
 
05:39:11.270 --> 05:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to happen how much it's going
 
05:39:13.948 --> 05:39:13.958 align:start position:0%
to cost um because there's a variety of
 
05:39:15.590 --> 05:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
ways in which it can happen the school
 
05:39:18.270 --> 05:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
district can send someone there they can
 
05:39:20.590 --> 05:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
contract with someone that's independent
 
05:39:22.990 --> 05:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
to go there the charter schools are
 
05:39:25.070 --> 05:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes providing that services and
 
05:39:29.230 --> 05:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
charging the schools so it's you know it
 
05:39:31.390 --> 05:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
it it's dependent upon the school and
 
05:39:33.548 --> 05:39:33.558 align:start position:0%
the but it's it's it's the agreement
 
05:39:36.030 --> 05:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
between the Lea and the charter school
 
05:39:38.350 --> 05:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
it's not about each specific kid it's
 
05:39:41.230 --> 05:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
the IEP that really dictates the child
 
05:39:43.110 --> 05:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
specific information thank thank you
 
05:39:43.910 --> 05:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a number of
 
05:39:45.788 --> 05:39:45.798 align:start position:0%
questions do you mind taking them sure
 
05:39:48.670 --> 05:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
go right ahead represent
 
05:39:52.750 --> 05:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
leus given that that's the case do you
 
05:39:55.390 --> 05:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
think a school do you think the mou
 
05:39:57.788 --> 05:39:57.798 align:start position:0%
could be done by October 1st rather than
 
05:40:00.910 --> 05:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
November 1st
 
05:40:03.270 --> 05:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
I think it it's possible we still are
 
05:40:07.070 --> 05:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
having difficulty getting some of theou
 
05:40:09.750 --> 05:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
signed it's the the the um you know it's
 
05:40:13.070 --> 05:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
up to the Lea to get these signed and
 
05:40:14.910 --> 05:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
people are doing their due diligence and
 
05:40:17.868 --> 05:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
documenting attempts um and it's only a
 
05:40:20.750 --> 05:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
small portion but I think giving folks
 
05:40:23.510 --> 05:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know more time is is just going to
 
05:40:26.310 --> 05:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
make it um more efficient for both the
 
05:40:30.548 --> 05:40:30.558 align:start position:0%
charter school and for the Lea
 
05:40:32.510 --> 05:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
follow up yes go ahead I'm just
 
05:40:34.590 --> 05:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about the students and whether
 
05:40:36.628 --> 05:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
or not they'll actually be getting the
 
05:40:39.708 --> 05:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
services while they're waiting for that
 
05:40:42.150 --> 05:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
and that's why I hesitate that's why I'm
 
05:40:44.190 --> 05:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
asking what the earliest we could put it
 
05:40:45.948 --> 05:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
as to make sure there aren't students
 
05:40:48.430 --> 05:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
being left behind well as I mentioned it
 
05:40:51.750 --> 05:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
the IEP the leas are obligated it's
 
05:40:54.110 --> 05:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
their responsibility regardless of
 
05:40:56.390 --> 05:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not the mou signed I mean
 
05:40:58.948 --> 05:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
they've got to provide those services so
 
05:41:01.628 --> 05:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
this is is just dictating like who's
 
05:41:04.510 --> 05:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
doing it and how much it's going to cost
 
05:41:06.350 --> 05:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh those kinds of things so the the Lea
 
05:41:08.990 --> 05:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
is really held responsible um by state
 
05:41:10.670 --> 05:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
and federal law to be providing those
 
05:41:12.788 --> 05:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
Services whether or not theou is signed
 
05:41:12.798 --> 05:41:13.750 align:start position:0%
Services whether or not theou is signed
or

05:41:13.750 --> 05:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:41:16.190 --> 05:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
not I I'm going to read one one thing
 
05:41:18.788 --> 05:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
here before we move on um the
 
05:41:22.190 --> 05:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
methodology under the fiscal report has
 
05:41:24.548 --> 05:41:24.558 align:start position:0%
a sentence the last sentence and it's a
 
05:41:26.350 --> 05:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
little bit of concern to myself I'll
 
05:41:28.948 --> 05:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
read it with the current difficulties
 
05:41:31.468 --> 05:41:31.478 align:start position:0%
all districts are having with finding
 
05:41:33.788 --> 05:41:33.798 align:start position:0%
staff and service providers this would
 
05:41:36.510 --> 05:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
make funding staff finding staff and
 
05:41:38.350 --> 05:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
service providers for charter school is
 
05:41:40.830 --> 05:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult near impossible
 
05:41:43.070 --> 05:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
after the school year starts ultimately
 
05:41:45.190 --> 05:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
any impact this bill may have on local
 
05:41:48.270 --> 05:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
school district expenditures in FY 25
 
05:41:50.070 --> 05:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
and Beyond is indeterminable I'm not
 
05:41:51.670 --> 05:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
worried about that last sentence so much
 
05:41:56.750 --> 05:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
is why why is it why is it so difficult
 
05:41:59.310 --> 05:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
for the sending schools to the charters
 
05:42:02.070 --> 05:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
to have this all figured out prior to
 
05:42:04.350 --> 05:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
the start of the school year like as I
 
05:42:06.030 --> 05:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned sometimes the districts don't
 
05:42:08.110 --> 05:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
even know that the kids are in in the
 
05:42:10.708 --> 05:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
charter schools um unless the parent
 
05:42:12.628 --> 05:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
notifies that they've made this decision
 
05:42:14.910 --> 05:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
and they're going to um place the kid
 
05:42:18.548 --> 05:42:18.558 align:start position:0%
there so um a lot of times you're still
 
05:42:21.670 --> 05:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
hiring folks uh in the summer and to
 
05:42:23.270 --> 05:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
determine you know who's going to
 
05:42:26.270 --> 05:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools to do the services and
 
05:42:28.590 --> 05:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
or or is this charter school going to do
 
05:42:30.990 --> 05:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
it if they're closed during the summer
 
05:42:33.230 --> 05:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
and there's all kinds of implications
 
05:42:36.510 --> 05:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
that could delay and make some
 
05:42:38.468 --> 05:42:38.478 align:start position:0%
difficulties repes cordelan then
 
05:42:41.270 --> 05:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
represent cascad thank you um yeah I
 
05:42:43.708 --> 05:42:43.718 align:start position:0%
think that maybe the methodology that
 
05:42:45.948 --> 05:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
chairman lad pointed out is the reason
 
05:42:48.510 --> 05:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
um uh Melissa white from the Department
 
05:42:50.510 --> 05:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
said that it's uh possible that no
 
05:42:52.670 --> 05:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
Services could be provided until
 
05:42:55.110 --> 05:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
November one um which would be the
 
05:42:59.708 --> 05:42:59.718 align:start position:0%
deadline for the uh um theou um
 
05:43:02.110 --> 05:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
well that's just my speculation but that
 
05:43:03.750 --> 05:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
that was her testimony it's possible
 
05:43:06.150 --> 05:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
that no Services could be provided till
 
05:43:08.670 --> 05:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
November 1st um and I'm not sure if it's
 
05:43:10.990 --> 05:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
because of theou or the difficulty in
 
05:43:14.110 --> 05:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
finding staff after the beginning of the
 
05:43:16.390 --> 05:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
year as I mentioned the leas are
 
05:43:18.590 --> 05:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
obligated um and there are there are
 
05:43:20.788 --> 05:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
circumstances when you can't find staff
 
05:43:23.350 --> 05:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
but that's true in our Public Schools
 
05:43:25.070 --> 05:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
also in our private special education
 
05:43:26.868 --> 05:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
schools in the world of special
 
05:43:28.708 --> 05:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
education it's a critical shortage area
 
05:43:30.830 --> 05:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about that a little
 
05:43:33.030 --> 05:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
while ago it's very very difficult to be
 
05:43:36.150 --> 05:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
filling positions so there may be a
 
05:43:38.990 --> 05:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
lapse in programming for for for kids
 
05:43:41.708 --> 05:43:41.718 align:start position:0%
but it's not specific to Charter
 
05:43:44.830 --> 05:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
Schools yes represent cascad uh thank
 
05:43:47.030 --> 05:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
you just um when I looked at the
 
05:43:49.468 --> 05:43:49.478 align:start position:0%
November deadline um I was thinking of
 
05:43:52.868 --> 05:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
the practicality of all of this to me it
 
05:43:55.670 --> 05:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
this makes sense for the simple reason
 
05:43:59.110 --> 05:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
that um October 1st is that Statewide
 
05:44:01.948 --> 05:44:01.958 align:start position:0%
data collection for enrollment right and
 
05:44:04.150 --> 05:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
so then that gives if there are students
 
05:44:06.110 --> 05:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
in a charter school that nobody knows
 
05:44:09.788 --> 05:44:09.798 align:start position:0%
about until that enrollment is reported
 
05:44:11.548 --> 05:44:11.558 align:start position:0%
it gives them a few weeks to like
 
05:44:14.830 --> 05:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
Scramble for aaff develop the IEP look
 
05:44:17.510 --> 05:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
to see what or not develop the IB
 
05:44:20.030 --> 05:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
whatever they decide as a team because a
 
05:44:20.040 --> 05:44:21.030 align:start position:0%
whatever they decide as a team because a
team

05:44:21.030 --> 05:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
team
 
05:44:23.468 --> 05:44:23.478 align:start position:0%
decision um and I wasn't so worried
 
05:44:25.750 --> 05:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
about kids not getting services in the
 
05:44:27.468 --> 05:44:27.478 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year because an IEP
 
05:44:29.390 --> 05:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
from the previous year would not have
 
05:44:34.190 --> 05:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
lapsed yeah so that's I mean I'm just
 
05:44:36.990 --> 05:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
thinking of implementation of that date
 
05:44:39.070 --> 05:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we like everything neat and in
 
05:44:40.788 --> 05:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
place by opening
 
05:44:44.390 --> 05:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
day um but where you have to look at
 
05:44:46.310 --> 05:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
your current schedule of students who
 
05:44:47.750 --> 05:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
are receiving
 
05:44:51.468 --> 05:44:51.478 align:start position:0%
Services you have to now develop a
 
05:44:54.230 --> 05:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
system to see what what else needs to be
 
05:44:55.948 --> 05:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
provided over and above that I think
 
05:44:59.190 --> 05:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
that's a time so represent cascad would
 
05:45:02.708 --> 05:45:02.718 align:start position:0%
it be better to have the annual mou from
 
05:45:06.708 --> 05:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
November 1 through October
 
05:45:09.468 --> 05:45:09.478 align:start position:0%
31st in thinking of the
 
05:45:12.468 --> 05:45:12.478 align:start position:0%
practicality I think it would work
 
05:45:12.478 --> 05:45:14.270 align:start position:0%
practicality I think it would work
better

05:45:14.270 --> 05:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:45:16.910 --> 05:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's what I was thinking when
 
05:45:18.868 --> 05:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
I read this I mean it might not be the
 
05:45:21.390 --> 05:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
end all cure all but so how do we take
 
05:45:24.350 --> 05:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
care of the kids which are coming
 
05:45:28.510 --> 05:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
in that may have an IEP an active IEP
 
05:45:28.520 --> 05:45:29.548 align:start position:0%
in that may have an IEP an active IEP
from

05:45:29.548 --> 05:45:29.558 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:45:31.510 --> 05:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
some other District other than that
 
05:45:35.110 --> 05:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
sending district and the services isn't
 
05:45:38.548 --> 05:45:38.558 align:start position:0%
going to be provided and quite possibly
 
05:45:40.868 --> 05:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
and violation of federal
 
05:45:43.510 --> 05:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
law I I don't see it that way I think if
 
05:45:44.948 --> 05:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
there was a student that came into a
 
05:45:46.830 --> 05:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
charter school with a significant need
 
05:45:49.270 --> 05:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
for services their first call is the
 
05:45:49.280 --> 05:45:50.590 align:start position:0%
for services their first call is the
district

05:45:50.590 --> 05:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
district
 
05:45:52.868 --> 05:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
school I mean maybe it's not I don't
 
05:45:55.070 --> 05:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
know and then that kicks things in
 
05:45:58.190 --> 05:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
action and again theou isn't student
 
05:46:01.230 --> 05:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
specific so when a child moves in yes
 
05:46:03.390 --> 05:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
you convene that team you've got x
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
amount of time to do that and and you
 
05:46:08.750 --> 05:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
know your will say you know oh we've got
 
05:46:10.390 --> 05:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
a teacher that's going to the charter
 
05:46:12.590 --> 05:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
school and this is when we're going to
 
05:46:14.830 --> 05:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
provide that service or you know the
 
05:46:16.628 --> 05:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
charter school is going to do it in
 
05:46:19.350 --> 05:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
charge us represent cordelli uh thank
 
05:46:21.750 --> 05:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
you but it's possible that that student
 
05:46:25.430 --> 05:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
is coming from a different school
 
05:46:29.910 --> 05:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
district for which the charter has noou
 
05:46:33.510 --> 05:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
so that would require them to put
 
05:46:36.030 --> 05:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
everything in place after the start of
 
05:46:39.150 --> 05:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
the school year very possibly theou has
 
05:46:41.788 --> 05:46:41.798 align:start position:0%
to be between the resident district and
 
05:46:44.270 --> 05:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
the charter right not the resident
 
05:46:47.030 --> 05:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
District of the kid the district which
 
05:46:49.830 --> 05:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
the charter is part of it's where the
 
05:46:52.510 --> 05:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
child lives so so you could have several
 
05:46:54.750 --> 05:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
districts that's right GL is right yeah
 
05:46:56.110 --> 05:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
yeah the charter schools are going to
 
05:47:00.350 --> 05:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
have M us from many districts
 
05:47:00.360 --> 05:47:03.548 align:start position:0%
have M us from many districts
okay

05:47:03.548 --> 05:47:03.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:08.230 --> 05:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
represas so explain to me what would
 
05:47:11.910 --> 05:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
happen if a kid comes from a district
 
05:47:15.590 --> 05:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
with an IEP in place from a district
 
05:47:18.868 --> 05:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
that has noou with the charter school
 
05:47:21.230 --> 05:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
and comes into that Charter School say
 
05:47:23.910 --> 05:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
shortly before the start of
 
05:47:27.510 --> 05:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
school the sending District yes is
 
05:47:29.390 --> 05:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
required to
 
05:47:30.948 --> 05:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
provide for that
 
05:47:34.910 --> 05:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
IEP but when it gets down to the how
 
05:47:35.910 --> 05:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:47:39.230 --> 05:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
done if there's no agreement to who
 
05:47:42.030 --> 05:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
provides it or where or any of that how
 
05:47:45.190 --> 05:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
is that IEP I mean what exactly is going
 
05:47:49.468 --> 05:47:49.478 align:start position:0%
to happen how is that IEP going to be
 
05:47:51.868 --> 05:47:51.878 align:start position:0%
provided for if there's no agreement as
 
05:47:55.230 --> 05:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
to who's providing it what what actually
 
05:47:58.510 --> 05:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
what is the the actual what happens when
 
05:48:02.750 --> 05:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
that kid shows up so I'm not sure if I
 
05:48:04.868 --> 05:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
understand the question but I'll try so
 
05:48:07.750 --> 05:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
you're saying that a school district um
 
05:48:09.150 --> 05:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
let's just say
 
05:48:13.030 --> 05:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester um doesn't have anou with the
 
05:48:16.190 --> 05:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
sunshine charter school and a kid moves
 
05:48:18.190 --> 05:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
into Manchester with an knife a kid
 
05:48:22.110 --> 05:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
moves from Manchester public school to
 
05:48:25.110 --> 05:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
that charter school with an
 
05:48:29.430 --> 05:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
i what happens so no agreement as to
 
05:48:31.708 --> 05:48:31.718 align:start position:0%
who's going to provide the
 
05:48:34.030 --> 05:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
services sorry there's no agreement as
 
05:48:36.468 --> 05:48:36.478 align:start position:0%
to who's going to provide the services
 
05:48:39.430 --> 05:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
yet how do the services actually get
 
05:48:42.510 --> 05:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
provided to begin with that's my
 
05:48:45.948 --> 05:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
question well the Lea is obligated to
 
05:48:49.390 --> 05:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
get thatou and if the charter school is
 
05:48:53.430 --> 05:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
refusing or they can't come to agreement
 
05:48:56.708 --> 05:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
what I'm seeing is legal is getting
 
05:48:58.910 --> 05:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
involved um the department of that has
 
05:49:00.910 --> 05:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
been clear that they don't get involved
 
05:49:03.910 --> 05:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
they're not mediators they don't when
 
05:49:05.390 --> 05:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
when there's
 
05:49:07.628 --> 05:49:07.638 align:start position:0%
disagreement they don't get involved at
 
05:49:10.548 --> 05:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
all it's up to the charter school and
 
05:49:14.868 --> 05:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
the Lea to work it out however um they
 
05:49:17.070 --> 05:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
want to do that but that doesn't stop
 
05:49:20.190 --> 05:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
the child from getting their services
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
because the Lea is obligated by law to
 
05:49:26.310 --> 05:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
do that whether or not the mou is signed
 
05:49:29.628 --> 05:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
or not so that's my question is how the
 
05:49:32.910 --> 05:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
I they get the services if nobody has
 
05:49:36.110 --> 05:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
agreed to who's providing them the Lea
 
05:49:37.788 --> 05:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
makes that decision I mean they they'll
 
05:49:39.230 --> 05:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
say we're going to send our speech
 
05:49:43.190 --> 05:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
therapists until you agree or um you
 
05:49:46.468 --> 05:49:46.478 align:start position:0%
know they've got to do it whatever way
 
05:49:50.548 --> 05:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
they can okay thank you the laa doesn't
 
05:49:54.030 --> 05:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
speak to Susan Jones the the the student
 
05:49:57.190 --> 05:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
it speaks to the services the laa is
 
05:49:58.990 --> 05:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
providing to the Charter
 
05:50:00.230 --> 05:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
whether you're going to do it through a
 
05:50:02.230 --> 05:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
contracted service or through a delivery
 
05:50:04.270 --> 05:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
service directly from your bank of
 
05:50:06.628 --> 05:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
teachers at the Lea or whether we're
 
05:50:08.468 --> 05:50:08.478 align:start position:0%
going to transfer the kids from charter
 
05:50:11.110 --> 05:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
school back to the ELA for delivery of
 
05:50:13.030 --> 05:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
service there there's a lot of different
 
05:50:15.030 --> 05:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
methodologies within statue allow us to
 
05:50:18.150 --> 05:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
do this I thought the mou was more Broad
 
05:50:19.990 --> 05:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
in dealing here's how we're going to
 
05:50:22.310 --> 05:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
provide the speech therapy services to
 
05:50:25.110 --> 05:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
this school and we'll send the speech
 
05:50:26.670 --> 05:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
therapists over there on Mondays and
 
05:50:29.430 --> 05:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
Thursdays or whatever
 
05:50:31.030 --> 05:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
is pretty broad I mean it doesn't say
 
05:50:34.030 --> 05:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
the name of the service provider but it
 
05:50:36.750 --> 05:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
was say it says that Manchester is going
 
05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
to provide all of the special education
 
05:50:42.270 --> 05:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
you know within that charter school or
 
05:50:44.070 --> 05:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to say we're going to
 
05:50:46.670 --> 05:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
contract with this organization to go
 
05:50:50.548 --> 05:50:50.558 align:start position:0%
into the charter school or the mou might
 
05:50:52.230 --> 05:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
say the charter school is going to
 
05:50:53.468 --> 05:50:53.478 align:start position:0%
provide the
 
05:50:56.510 --> 05:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
services here's their credentials here's
 
05:50:59.030 --> 05:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
how much we're going to charge um and
 
05:51:00.590 --> 05:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
here's how we're going to work with you
 
05:51:02.990 --> 05:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
to monitor that progress so you're right
 
05:51:04.910 --> 05:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
there's there's all different ways in
 
05:51:09.708 --> 05:51:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:14.070 --> 05:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
written represent Miler so we have the
 
05:51:15.708 --> 05:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
date here of November 1st there's
 
05:51:19.750 --> 05:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
nothing that would uh prohibit a school
 
05:51:22.548 --> 05:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
district from developing that prior to
 
05:51:25.430 --> 05:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
November 1 exactly so this is just an
 
05:51:27.788 --> 05:51:27.798 align:start position:0%
out this is an outside date that you
 
05:51:32.548 --> 05:51:32.558 align:start position:0%
have to get done by uh secondly I think
 
05:51:37.030 --> 05:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
if uh if if my child has an IEP and I'm
 
05:51:38.590 --> 05:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
going to go to a charter school I
 
05:51:42.510 --> 05:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
already have the IEP does that help to
 
05:51:45.548 --> 05:51:45.558 align:start position:0%
facilitate uh that process of the trans
 
05:51:48.430 --> 05:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
the transition from my child going to a
 
05:51:50.910 --> 05:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
charter school and yet receiving the
 
05:51:53.948 --> 05:51:53.958 align:start position:0%
same kinds of services that I would have
 
05:51:57.270 --> 05:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:57.280 --> 05:51:59.190 align:start position:0%
 
District

05:51:59.190 --> 05:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
District
 
05:52:01.788 --> 05:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
so could you repeat the question so I've
 
05:52:05.830 --> 05:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
got an IEP y from Hopkinson and I want
 
05:52:09.030 --> 05:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
to go to Mary Smith's charter school
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
down here I've got the IEP the services
 
05:52:13.628 --> 05:52:13.638 align:start position:0%
have been provided by the resident
 
05:52:15.708 --> 05:52:15.718 align:start position:0%
School District I'm now going to be
 
05:52:18.230 --> 05:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
going here wouldn't I be receiving
 
05:52:21.670 --> 05:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
similar Services if with that IE TR with
 
05:52:26.110 --> 05:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
that IEP transfer to that charter school
 
05:52:28.270 --> 05:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
yeah the IEP won't change the team will
 
05:52:30.070 --> 05:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
convene and just review and make sure
 
05:52:32.548 --> 05:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
you got the credential people and that
 
05:52:35.948 --> 05:52:35.958 align:start position:0%
everything's in place and if I may Mr CH
 
05:52:38.030 --> 05:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh and and the team you're
 
05:52:41.270 --> 05:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
referring to would be those who are from
 
05:52:43.788 --> 05:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
the resident school district and now
 
05:52:46.830 --> 05:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
some new personalities that would be in
 
05:52:49.070 --> 05:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
the charter school that would be
 
05:52:51.910 --> 05:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for making sure that the
 
05:52:53.628 --> 05:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
resident school district is meeting
 
05:52:55.868 --> 05:52:55.878 align:start position:0%
their obligations through the IEP is
 
05:52:57.990 --> 05:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
that correct yes it's a combination of
 
05:53:01.628 --> 05:53:01.638 align:start position:0%
both staff thank you further
 
05:53:04.590 --> 05:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
questions of
 
05:53:06.990 --> 05:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
Jane Becky you've been a special all
 
05:53:11.150 --> 05:53:11.160 align:start position:0%

05:53:13.760 --> 05:53:19.510 align:start position:0%
that well we know you've been a director
of

05:53:19.510 --> 05:53:19.520 align:start position:0%

it uh thank you good afternoon uh Becky
 
05:53:24.110 --> 05:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
Wilson from New Hampshire school boards
 
05:53:26.468 --> 05:53:26.478 align:start position:0%
Association I'm happy to try to clarify
 
05:53:29.868 --> 05:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
any other um questions that maybe Jane
 
05:53:32.070 --> 05:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't addressed other than our
 
05:53:33.788 --> 05:53:33.798 align:start position:0%
understanding from the school district
 
05:53:34.990 --> 05:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
perspective and the Schoolboard
 
05:53:37.350 --> 05:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
perspective theou is really an
 
05:53:39.190 --> 05:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
administrative it's talking about
 
05:53:42.150 --> 05:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
billing who's in charge of billing what
 
05:53:43.390 --> 05:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
you're how you're billing certain
 
05:53:45.190 --> 05:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
Services who's responsible for setting
 
05:53:47.868 --> 05:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
them up supervision Etc it's not a
 
05:53:50.750 --> 05:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
student specific issue we were providing
 
05:53:52.430 --> 05:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
services to students at Charter Schools
 
05:53:55.990 --> 05:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
long before anou ever existed
 
05:53:58.948 --> 05:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
so yes represent Terry questions occur
 
05:54:01.350 --> 05:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
to me and I I don't know the best person
 
05:54:04.390 --> 05:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
available please answer one or
 
05:54:07.708 --> 05:54:07.718 align:start position:0%
both uh wondering where the where the
 
05:54:10.670 --> 05:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
date November 1st came from as the the
 
05:54:14.670 --> 05:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
date originally uh proposed why October
 
05:54:17.150 --> 05:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
November 1 instead of some other day I'm
 
05:54:19.230 --> 05:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
assuming that it wasn't arbitrary but
 
05:54:20.750 --> 05:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
that there was some rationale for that
 
05:54:22.110 --> 05:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'm really seeking the
 
05:54:25.270 --> 05:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
rationale for November the 1st the other
 
05:54:28.350 --> 05:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
question is uh I need clarification on
 
05:54:30.910 --> 05:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
the memorandum of understanding are is
 
05:54:33.230 --> 05:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
the memorandum of uh understanding
 
05:54:33.240 --> 05:54:34.350 align:start position:0%
the memorandum of uh understanding
student

05:54:34.350 --> 05:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
student
 
05:54:36.788 --> 05:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
specific so that if you had two
 
05:54:38.628 --> 05:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
different students coming from two
 
05:54:40.548 --> 05:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
different school districts you would
 
05:54:42.510 --> 05:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
have two different memorandums of
 
05:54:44.670 --> 05:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
understanding or if you had if you had
 
05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
two students coming from the same school
 
05:54:50.628 --> 05:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
to the same PRI charter school would you
 
05:54:52.510 --> 05:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
only need one memorandum of
 
05:54:54.230 --> 05:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
understanding or because the needs were
 
05:54:55.788 --> 05:54:55.798 align:start position:0%
different for the two students you need
 
05:54:57.670 --> 05:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
two memorandums of understanding which
 
05:55:00.708 --> 05:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
lead which prompts me then to ask if if
 
05:55:02.868 --> 05:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
it's prompt if it's defined by the
 
05:55:05.310 --> 05:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
student and the student needs then why
 
05:55:07.670 --> 05:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
not language such that no later than
 
05:55:10.390 --> 05:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
four weeks after enrollment rather than
 
05:55:12.750 --> 05:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
this arbit seemingly arbitrary date of
 
05:55:14.830 --> 05:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
November the 1st and if you can remember
 
05:55:16.670 --> 05:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
all of that I would appreciate it
 
05:55:19.350 --> 05:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure I can I'll do my
 
05:55:21.868 --> 05:55:21.878 align:start position:0%
best to Jane can certainly fill in it is
 
05:55:23.948 --> 05:55:23.958 align:start position:0%
important to me thank you thank you um
 
05:55:25.868 --> 05:55:25.878 align:start position:0%
I'm I'll go backwards because I think
 
05:55:28.310 --> 05:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
that might be easier when this bill was
 
05:55:31.030 --> 05:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
originally brought to the committee the
 
05:55:34.670 --> 05:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
Catalyst for the bill was that yet
 
05:55:36.310 --> 05:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
public charter schools take students
 
05:55:38.350 --> 05:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
from multiple districts it doesn't
 
05:55:40.948 --> 05:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
matter where they live if the if the kid
 
05:55:42.948 --> 05:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
shows up there and the parent enrolls
 
05:55:44.230 --> 05:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
them at a charter school a district
 
05:55:46.310 --> 05:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
cannot place a kid at a charter school
 
05:55:48.430 --> 05:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
the parent is enrolling them that it's
 
05:55:50.548 --> 05:55:50.558 align:start position:0%
potentially possible that a charter
 
05:55:53.868 --> 05:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
school could have realistically 10 or 20
 
05:55:56.070 --> 05:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
districts and that the districts that
 
05:55:57.628 --> 05:55:57.638 align:start position:0%
are the districts of residents are to
 
05:56:00.190 --> 05:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
provide the services for are responsible
 
05:56:01.990 --> 05:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
for the service provision for those
 
05:56:04.310 --> 05:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
students and if you're working with 10
 
05:56:05.948 --> 05:56:05.958 align:start position:0%
or 20 districts they could all have
 
05:56:07.510 --> 05:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
different ways in which they wanted to
 
05:56:09.468 --> 05:56:09.478 align:start position:0%
do that it was causing a lot of
 
05:56:11.948 --> 05:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
confusion in terms of billing and things
 
05:56:15.350 --> 05:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
like that administrative tasks so theou
 
05:56:17.670 --> 05:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
was meant to try to create a template
 
05:56:19.868 --> 05:56:19.878 align:start position:0%
that could be consistent that districts
 
05:56:21.948 --> 05:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
and Charter Schools could use together
 
05:56:24.628 --> 05:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
to try to create some expectation of
 
05:56:26.390 --> 05:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
consistency for those kinds of things
 
05:56:28.150 --> 05:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
like rates for different providers ERS
 
05:56:31.030 --> 05:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
of services who was qualified to provide
 
05:56:35.190 --> 05:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
them in different situations Etc this
 
05:56:36.708 --> 05:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
contract that you're talking about for
 
05:56:40.350 --> 05:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
student specific needs that's the IEP
 
05:56:42.110 --> 05:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's that is the student specific
 
05:56:44.750 --> 05:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
piece theou is really a broad to Jam's
 
05:56:48.948 --> 05:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
Point earlier attempt at clarifying
 
05:56:53.548 --> 05:56:53.558 align:start position:0%
responsibility and rates and uh tasks in
 
05:56:55.990 --> 05:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
terms of who is filing certain paperwork
 
05:56:58.670 --> 05:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
Etc so that things are between the
 
05:57:01.628 --> 05:57:01.638 align:start position:0%
districts and the Charter School uh what
 
05:57:03.230 --> 05:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
was the first part of your question on
 
05:57:06.510 --> 05:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
November 1st so so may I answer uh so
 
05:57:08.670 --> 05:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
the first question was can you give us
 
05:57:11.510 --> 05:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
any information or provide any insight
 
05:57:14.628 --> 05:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
as to where November 1st came from in
 
05:57:18.150 --> 05:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
the original proposal here I me what so
 
05:57:20.390 --> 05:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
you why then as opposed to some other
 
05:57:22.670 --> 05:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
time such as four weeks within four
 
05:57:25.030 --> 05:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
weeks after enrollment or Sub sub thing
 
05:57:25.948 --> 05:57:25.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:57:28.548 --> 05:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
representative I think originally in can
 
05:57:32.230 --> 05:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
help me if I'm not remembering correctly
 
05:57:34.190 --> 05:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
when this bill first came it there was
 
05:57:36.670 --> 05:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
no date I think it just said within 30
 
05:57:38.830 --> 05:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
days of enrollment and the problem that
 
05:57:40.628 --> 05:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
I think people were concerned about with
 
05:57:42.190 --> 05:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
that is that because a parent is
 
05:57:45.110 --> 05:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
enrolling the child you might not know
 
05:57:47.708 --> 05:57:47.718 align:start position:0%
within 30 days or it could be summer and
 
05:57:49.670 --> 05:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
school may not be in session so there
 
05:57:52.590 --> 05:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
could be some challenge in terms of
 
05:57:54.788 --> 05:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
clarifying um some of those things
 
05:57:56.910 --> 05:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
because people just might not be aware
 
05:57:59.868 --> 05:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
it's also not common in any District or
 
05:58:02.030 --> 05:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
public charter school that the first 30
 
05:58:04.270 --> 05:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
days of school the first 45 days of
 
05:58:06.670 --> 05:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
school everybody is sort of getting up
 
05:58:09.070 --> 05:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
and running so even in your local public
 
05:58:11.030 --> 05:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
schools there's some things that are
 
05:58:13.030 --> 05:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
still sort of being figured out in terms
 
05:58:14.430 --> 05:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
of day-to-day
 
05:58:17.548 --> 05:58:17.558 align:start position:0%
operations um that would be similar at a
 
05:58:19.990 --> 05:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
charter school for example and so trying
 
05:58:21.948 --> 05:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
to have everything lined up before kids
 
05:58:24.190 --> 05:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
get off the bus on the very first day
 
05:58:26.670 --> 05:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
might not be realistic so there was sort
 
05:58:28.070 --> 05:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
of this conversation about trying to
 
05:58:29.830 --> 05:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
find The Sweet Spot of what was the
 
05:58:32.310 --> 05:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
right date and I think that November 1st
 
05:58:34.070 --> 05:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
seemed like you have been in school
 
05:58:36.510 --> 05:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
about 60 days your other reporting
 
05:58:38.430 --> 05:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
requirements would have already been met
 
05:58:40.150 --> 05:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
so all these things that districts are
 
05:58:41.990 --> 05:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
already doing about enrollment who's
 
05:58:43.750 --> 05:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
going where and making sure you have all
 
05:58:46.110 --> 05:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
your ducks in a row would be clean so
 
05:58:47.990 --> 05:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
your data collection would be clean when
 
05:58:50.430 --> 05:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
those muus would need to be signed go
 
05:58:52.468 --> 05:58:52.478 align:start position:0%
ahead so to representative lak's
 
05:58:54.510 --> 05:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
question just to be clear because the
 
05:58:57.350 --> 05:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
IEP is following the student the Lea is
 
05:58:59.270 --> 05:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
I guess is is obligated to provide the
 
05:59:02.110 --> 05:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
services so the memor memorandum of
 
05:59:04.990 --> 05:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
understanding whether it's October 1st
 
05:59:07.070 --> 05:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
or November 1 is not any kind of
 
05:59:08.910 --> 05:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
impediment to the student receiving the
 
05:59:11.190 --> 05:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
services it's rather a
 
05:59:13.390 --> 05:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
formalization of that which is going to
 
05:59:15.430 --> 05:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
take place with respect to the two
 
05:59:17.670 --> 05:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
districts that are involved correct
 
05:59:19.830 --> 05:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question in theory yes
 
05:59:21.430 --> 05:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
and the only reason that it might be
 
05:59:23.590 --> 05:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
confusing is again it's a parental
 
05:59:25.910 --> 05:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
placement so districts are not always
 
05:59:28.270 --> 05:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
involved from the get-go so the
 
05:59:30.190 --> 05:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
the date aspect of it as long as the
 
05:59:31.990 --> 05:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
parent alerts the charter school that
 
05:59:34.110 --> 05:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
the student is coming in and the student
 
05:59:36.190 --> 05:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
has previously been eligible and has a
 
05:59:38.830 --> 05:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
current IEP that communication should be
 
05:59:40.350 --> 05:59:40.360 align:start position:0%
happening between the charter school and
 
05:59:41.750 --> 05:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
the District of residents and they
 
05:59:43.590 --> 05:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
should be figuring that out regardless
 
05:59:45.830 --> 05:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
of theou or at the latest they're going
 
05:59:47.788 --> 05:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
to know the first day the child shows up
 
05:59:49.468 --> 05:59:49.478 align:start position:0%
at the school as long as someone
 
05:59:51.628 --> 05:59:51.638 align:start position:0%
discloses that to them yes thank you
 
05:59:54.390 --> 05:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
yeah um I I we have a question for you
 
05:59:55.788 --> 05:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
because we've just had a communication
 
05:59:57.190 --> 05:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
from Melissa white who's ill and
 
06:00:01.190 --> 06:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here and the question was um
 
06:00:04.310 --> 06:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
that represent leus had asked and here's
 
06:00:07.110 --> 06:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
the response and there is no sanction
 
06:00:09.750 --> 06:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
for the charter school not to sign
 
06:00:14.430 --> 06:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
theou so some of them are not signing it
 
06:00:17.750 --> 06:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
so is this issue we're looking at larger
 
06:00:20.548 --> 06:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
than a date is it the the whole thing
 
06:00:23.230 --> 06:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
came about as I recall because Services
 
06:00:25.030 --> 06:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
weren't being provided to the charter
 
06:00:26.230 --> 06:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
school or the charter school and
 
06:00:28.030 --> 06:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree with the Lea
 
06:00:29.628 --> 06:00:29.638 align:start position:0%
and how these Services were to be
 
06:00:32.788 --> 06:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
delivered where or where and so then
 
06:00:35.670 --> 06:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
that we had this conflict whether it's
 
06:00:38.350 --> 06:00:38.360 align:start position:0%
one side or the other doesn't sound like
 
06:00:40.430 --> 06:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
there's any way we have to say there
 
06:00:42.670 --> 06:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be anou in
 
06:00:44.910 --> 06:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
place and it takes a long time for these
 
06:00:46.990 --> 06:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
mlus I remember we tried to get anou
 
06:00:48.310 --> 06:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
between Dartmouth College and the
 
06:00:50.110 --> 06:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
municipality of Hanover that took us
 
06:00:51.510 --> 06:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
three years with the county attorney
 
06:00:51.520 --> 06:00:52.310 align:start position:0%
three years with the county attorney
getting

06:00:52.310 --> 06:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
getting
 
06:00:55.150 --> 06:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
involved so I I'm a little bit concerned
 
06:00:56.510 --> 06:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
whether November one is really going to
 
06:00:58.708 --> 06:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
fix anything
 
06:01:00.830 --> 06:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
well our association has been meeting
 
06:01:03.750 --> 06:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
every month with the um Charter School
 
06:01:06.510 --> 06:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
Bureau with the Charter School Alliance
 
06:01:08.948 --> 06:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
and the Bureau of special education and
 
06:01:12.510 --> 06:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
I would say the vast majority of charter
 
06:01:15.948 --> 06:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
schools have worked hand inand with the
 
06:01:20.390 --> 06:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
leas in getting um those mou signed I
 
06:01:23.990 --> 06:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
believe it's just a small amount of um
 
06:01:25.868 --> 06:01:25.878 align:start position:0%
schools where we've got a little bit of
 
06:01:28.190 --> 06:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
a challenge in terms of not getting
 
06:01:31.868 --> 06:01:31.878 align:start position:0%
signatures in terms of the date November
 
06:01:34.788 --> 06:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
I to to Becky's point it gives everyone
 
06:01:37.830 --> 06:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
um a chance to figure out schedules and
 
06:01:40.910 --> 06:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
do what's best for the child I'm also
 
06:01:43.510 --> 06:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
seeing that some regions of the state
 
06:01:45.590 --> 06:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
are working together because we're
 
06:01:49.030 --> 06:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
having such a hard time finding people
 
06:01:51.670 --> 06:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
um and they're charting who needs what
 
06:01:54.510 --> 06:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
services at what schools so that they
 
06:01:58.270 --> 06:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
can work together and cost share and you
 
06:02:01.310 --> 06:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
know do their absolute best to get these
 
06:02:03.788 --> 06:02:03.798 align:start position:0%
services to the kids in the charter
 
06:02:06.270 --> 06:02:06.280 align:start position:0%
schools so I think everyone's trying
 
06:02:09.070 --> 06:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
really hard and I think you know theou
 
06:02:12.548 --> 06:02:12.558 align:start position:0%
has given some consistency and framework
 
06:02:15.628 --> 06:02:15.638 align:start position:0%
and with anything you know that's new I
 
06:02:17.310 --> 06:02:17.320 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have a few speed
 
06:02:19.468 --> 06:02:19.478 align:start position:0%
bumps along the way and we we do have a
 
06:02:21.670 --> 06:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
few Charter Schools where um they're
 
06:02:25.910 --> 06:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
seeking legal guidance and um there are
 
06:02:29.788 --> 06:02:29.798 align:start position:0%
some conflicts there but overall it
 
06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:38.910 --> 06:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
smoothly well you it's represent leus uh
 
06:02:38.920 --> 06:02:41.270 align:start position:0%
smoothly well you it's represent leus uh
go

06:02:41.270 --> 06:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:44.310 --> 06:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
ahead so
 
06:02:46.990 --> 06:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
overall kids are getting the services
 
06:02:49.230 --> 06:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
they need one way or another is that
 
06:02:51.708 --> 06:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
what you're I would say yes I mean even
 
06:02:53.788 --> 06:02:53.798 align:start position:0%
in our Public Schools we're short on
 
06:02:56.468 --> 06:02:56.478 align:start position:0%
staff and there are times when kids
 
06:02:57.788 --> 06:02:57.798 align:start position:0%
aren't getting Serv
 
06:03:00.468 --> 06:03:00.478 align:start position:0%
but we know we have to make them up okay
 
06:03:00.478 --> 06:03:02.310 align:start position:0%
but we know we have to make them up okay
thank

06:03:02.310 --> 06:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:03:05.590 --> 06:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
you represent cordelli thank
 
06:03:09.468 --> 06:03:09.478 align:start position:0%
you I for one um would be hesitant
 
06:03:14.230 --> 06:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
moving forward I'm sorry thank you um
 
06:03:16.230 --> 06:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
would be hesitant moving forward today
 
06:03:19.310 --> 06:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
on this um it seems to me this
 
06:03:21.390 --> 06:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
uncertainty um you know especially with
 
06:03:23.830 --> 06:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
the director of instruction saying that
 
06:03:26.868 --> 06:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh there are instances where that mou is
 
06:03:28.310 --> 06:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
not getting
 
06:03:33.590 --> 06:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
signed and um that there um might be a
 
06:03:36.750 --> 06:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
lack of services being provided to some
 
06:03:40.190 --> 06:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
students um and you know she mentioned
 
06:03:42.190 --> 06:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
um you know there's no penalty for not
 
06:03:42.200 --> 06:03:43.230 align:start position:0%
um you know there's no penalty for not
signing

06:03:43.230 --> 06:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
signing
 
06:03:48.110 --> 06:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
theou um so I I I for one would say that
 
06:03:50.310 --> 06:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
we need to look into this a little bit
 
06:03:53.910 --> 06:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
more before um moving forward on it
 
06:03:57.270 --> 06:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
today and I I'm going line with that um
 
06:03:59.350 --> 06:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
you know I'm all for doing something but
 
06:04:01.708 --> 06:04:01.718 align:start position:0%
you know I have a daughter who's a
 
06:04:04.150 --> 06:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
special ed teacher was a special teacher
 
06:04:06.110 --> 06:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
in bath and having deliver Services
 
06:04:08.150 --> 06:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
outside trying to coordinate that
 
06:04:10.868 --> 06:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
schedule with the receiving school and
 
06:04:13.430 --> 06:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
the sending school was extremely
 
06:04:14.390 --> 06:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
difficult and I don't know if they ever
 
06:04:18.070 --> 06:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
got anou in place
 
06:04:20.628 --> 06:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
so I I think we need to do something
 
06:04:22.990 --> 06:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
here but I don't really you know whether
 
06:04:26.788 --> 06:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
it should be you know from uh a a school
 
06:04:29.350 --> 06:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
rather than using a school year we use a
 
06:04:31.110 --> 06:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
a period of time which I mentioned
 
06:04:32.590 --> 06:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden earlier from
 
06:04:34.788 --> 06:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
maybe November one November one to
 
06:04:34.798 --> 06:04:35.868 align:start position:0%
maybe November one November one to
October

06:04:35.868 --> 06:04:35.878 align:start position:0%
October
 
06:04:40.030 --> 06:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
31 um uh that might be good but also I
 
06:04:42.150 --> 06:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have if we can gather more
 
06:04:44.788 --> 06:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
information from director white uh the
 
06:04:46.150 --> 06:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
information that representative cordelli
 
06:04:49.110 --> 06:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
just spoke to is that is this working if
 
06:04:51.310 --> 06:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
it's not working can we do anything to
 
06:04:53.750 --> 06:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
try to get it to work I know there's a
 
06:04:56.310 --> 06:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage there's teacher issues
 
06:04:57.868 --> 06:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
in terms of even providing all the
 
06:05:01.190 --> 06:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
services within the laa itself more or
 
06:05:03.430 --> 06:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
less transporting and going somewhere
 
06:05:05.350 --> 06:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
else either transporting to the laa or
 
06:05:08.030 --> 06:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
from the LA to the the charter so Becky
 
06:05:09.868 --> 06:05:09.878 align:start position:0%
and I were just talking it's important
 
06:05:13.350 --> 06:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
to remember that the services in the IEP
 
06:05:16.628 --> 06:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
really are very different than theou so
 
06:05:19.350 --> 06:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
if a child isn't getting services that
 
06:05:24.430 --> 06:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
may or may not be um connected to theou
 
06:05:26.468 --> 06:05:26.478 align:start position:0%
and in most circumstances it's probably
 
06:05:30.430 --> 06:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
not it's probably a kid specific issue a
 
06:05:34.868 --> 06:05:34.878 align:start position:0%
staffing issue um probably not anou
 
06:05:37.150 --> 06:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
issue well it could be a contractual
 
06:05:39.590 --> 06:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
issue it could be a a transportation
 
06:05:42.270 --> 06:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
issue it could be related to
 
06:05:44.830 --> 06:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
scheduling at the different facilities
 
06:05:47.190 --> 06:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
the availability of a a staff member to
 
06:05:50.430 --> 06:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
get there or not get there um and I
 
06:05:53.030 --> 06:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
think that's gon to even if you had anou
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen sometimes yeah
 
06:05:59.548 --> 06:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
yeah if if I'm missing something here um
 
06:06:02.390 --> 06:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
let me know but but it it would seem it
 
06:06:05.030 --> 06:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
it seems from what we've heard that
 
06:06:08.430 --> 06:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
theou defines the responsibilities in
 
06:06:11.430 --> 06:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
the relationship between the the
 
06:06:13.910 --> 06:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
District of residents and the charter
 
06:06:16.708 --> 06:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
school that the that the student is is
 
06:06:19.510 --> 06:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
is attending and those responsibilities
 
06:06:19.520 --> 06:06:20.548 align:start position:0%
is attending and those responsibilities
would

06:06:20.548 --> 06:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:06:23.948 --> 06:06:23.958 align:start position:0%
include um where services are provided
 
06:06:27.990 --> 06:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
how services are provided um um
 
06:06:30.110 --> 06:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
how much services are going to be build
 
06:06:34.868 --> 06:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
for and obviously the the ultimate
 
06:06:37.430 --> 06:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility based on what I'm hearing
 
06:06:40.150 --> 06:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
for the provision of these Services
 
06:06:42.830 --> 06:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
rests with the District of residents not
 
06:06:45.548 --> 06:06:45.558 align:start position:0%
with the not with the charter but we've
 
06:06:48.190 --> 06:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
talked about in this committee as long
 
06:06:49.390 --> 06:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
as I've been on the committee and I'm
 
06:06:52.390 --> 06:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
sure much longer for senior you know
 
06:06:54.830 --> 06:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um have have
 
06:06:57.270 --> 06:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
talked about providing services in least
 
06:06:59.830 --> 06:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment and and I think
 
06:07:04.310 --> 06:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
theou probably seeks that that out and
 
06:07:06.910 --> 06:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
from year to year
 
06:07:10.110 --> 06:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
unless you know Charter a is now taking
 
06:07:13.670 --> 06:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
a a student from a district that they've
 
06:07:16.510 --> 06:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
that that that's new to them so and and
 
06:07:19.590 --> 06:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
I agree that that would happen um that
 
06:07:22.430 --> 06:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
would happen for most for for most of
 
06:07:25.788 --> 06:07:25.798 align:start position:0%
the IEPs that are in place theou is
 
06:07:28.030 --> 06:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
continuing on for years year after year
 
06:07:30.310 --> 06:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
and having thatou in place is really
 
06:07:32.590 --> 06:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
important for a new District they could
 
06:07:37.030 --> 06:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
rely on in you know look at anou from a
 
06:07:38.750 --> 06:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
district that's already working with
 
06:07:40.708 --> 06:07:40.718 align:start position:0%
that Charter and say hey here's what
 
06:07:42.990 --> 06:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
here's what the other schools were were
 
06:07:46.430 --> 06:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
we're doing on here but but from a
 
06:07:48.868 --> 06:07:48.878 align:start position:0%
practical standpoint you know saying
 
06:07:51.350 --> 06:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
that this is going to be negotiated and
 
06:07:54.310 --> 06:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
developed during the summertime when
 
06:07:56.430 --> 06:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
when yeah I mean school districts
 
06:07:59.110 --> 06:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
special education directors are year-
 
06:08:00.830 --> 06:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
round employees at a school district so
 
06:08:02.350 --> 06:08:02.360 align:start position:0%
they're around but there aren't a lot of
 
06:08:04.830 --> 06:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
employees around at at a at a charter
 
06:08:08.430 --> 06:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
school that that having this done for
 
06:08:11.430 --> 06:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
for by November 1st which gives the
 
06:08:13.110 --> 06:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
whole month of September the whole month
 
06:08:15.430 --> 06:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
of nove whole month of October to make
 
06:08:18.948 --> 06:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
changes to theou makes a lot of sense to
 
06:08:23.030 --> 06:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
me um and and you know
 
06:08:26.628 --> 06:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
ultimately the the students IEP is going
 
06:08:29.788 --> 06:08:29.798 align:start position:0%
to to define the resources that need to
 
06:08:35.350 --> 06:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
be um in place theou defines the who's
 
06:08:37.708 --> 06:08:37.718 align:start position:0%
responsible who's paying for it and how
 
06:08:38.948 --> 06:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
much are they
 
06:08:41.310 --> 06:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
paying so I you
 
06:08:43.548 --> 06:08:43.558 align:start position:0%
know the important thing is to get it
 
06:08:48.468 --> 06:08:48.478 align:start position:0%
done and and and you know I you know we
 
06:08:50.948 --> 06:08:50.958 align:start position:0%
heard the other day how important it is
 
06:08:54.070 --> 06:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
to get inside a school district and I
 
06:08:55.590 --> 06:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
think if we were to be in a school
 
06:08:58.910 --> 06:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
district for the first 60 days you'd
 
06:09:02.190 --> 06:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
realize how quickly November 1st comes
 
06:09:04.670 --> 06:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
around and how much work there is to do
 
06:09:07.270 --> 06:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
between September 1st or you know right
 
06:09:09.590 --> 06:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
after Labor Day or right before Labor
 
06:09:11.670 --> 06:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
Day when when schools come in and then
 
06:09:13.390 --> 06:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
you're at October 1st you're reporting
 
06:09:15.390 --> 06:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
out enrollments and wow then you're in
 
06:09:17.708 --> 06:09:17.718 align:start position:0%
November 1st and before you know it
 
06:09:20.750 --> 06:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
you're into the holidays so um so
 
06:09:23.070 --> 06:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
November 1st is a great deadline to have
 
06:09:28.230 --> 06:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
for um um for contracts so
 
06:09:31.708 --> 06:09:31.718 align:start position:0%
so I I you know and and this also isn't
 
06:09:33.750 --> 06:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
the last stop for this bill I know we
 
06:09:36.030 --> 06:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
got a lot of bills to exec it'll go to
 
06:09:38.708 --> 06:09:38.718 align:start position:0%
the Senate it'll it'll have additional
 
06:09:40.150 --> 06:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
hearings whe whether this needs to
 
06:09:44.150 --> 06:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
wiggle to October 1st you
 
06:09:46.548 --> 06:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
know you know I think November 1st is
 
06:09:49.590 --> 06:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
probably the right date in terms of um
 
06:09:51.708 --> 06:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
uh bringing it on I I think we could get
 
06:09:55.468 --> 06:09:55.478 align:start position:0%
this get this done today represent
 
06:09:57.788 --> 06:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
cordelli um
 
06:09:59.830 --> 06:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
I I would definitely like to see
 
06:10:02.190 --> 06:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
something done with this um I think it's
 
06:10:04.628 --> 06:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
a good vehicle to
 
06:10:07.990 --> 06:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
um resolve any other problems that there
 
06:10:12.270 --> 06:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
might be um you know in terms of what um
 
06:10:14.910 --> 06:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
director white said if there are
 
06:10:18.350 --> 06:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
problems in getting a charter school to
 
06:10:21.590 --> 06:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
sign theou if they they are holding
 
06:10:24.230 --> 06:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
things up for some reason you know maybe
 
06:10:26.350 --> 06:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
there and she said you know there's no
 
06:10:29.270 --> 06:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
Penal for them not signing theou which
 
06:10:31.750 --> 06:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
does you know include contractual things
 
06:10:36.150 --> 06:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
rates and Etc which is pretty important
 
06:10:38.788 --> 06:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
um you know I would like to see us you
 
06:10:41.350 --> 06:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
know make a little take a little time on
 
06:10:43.910 --> 06:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
this um you know I agree it could be
 
06:10:45.590 --> 06:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
amended in the Senate but but there's
 
06:10:47.788 --> 06:10:47.798 align:start position:0%
also no rush to doing it today we have
 
06:10:50.750 --> 06:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
time so I would um very much like to
 
06:10:53.070 --> 06:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
hold on to this and see if we can uh
 
06:10:56.030 --> 06:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
chat further with uh the parties
 
06:10:56.040 --> 06:10:57.190 align:start position:0%
chat further with uh the parties
involved

06:10:57.190 --> 06:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
involved
 
06:10:59.868 --> 06:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
um including um the director of charter
 
06:11:02.110 --> 06:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
schools maybe the Charter School
 
06:11:04.910 --> 06:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
Alliance um and the director of
 
06:11:07.430 --> 06:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
instruction and special ed I'd also
 
06:11:09.190 --> 06:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
remind you too that you know in on
 
06:11:11.548 --> 06:11:11.558 align:start position:0%
behalf of the charter schools many of
 
06:11:14.430 --> 06:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
them may be working with 20 or more
 
06:11:18.150 --> 06:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
districts so giving them the time um to
 
06:11:21.310 --> 06:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
schedule those meetings with the leas um
 
06:11:24.590 --> 06:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
I think they would benefit also from the
 
06:11:27.390 --> 06:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
time um you know if you if you give them
 
06:11:30.350 --> 06:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
that November deadline on behalf of the
 
06:11:32.750 --> 06:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
kids and getting you know giving them
 
06:11:35.070 --> 06:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
ample time to work with the elas and
 
06:11:37.670 --> 06:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
coordinate is is also something to think
 
06:11:41.708 --> 06:11:41.718 align:start position:0%
about right and I I think in my mind the
 
06:11:44.190 --> 06:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
most important thing and the most scary
 
06:11:45.510 --> 06:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
thing that I've heard is that it's
 
06:11:47.230 --> 06:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
possible that no Services could be
 
06:11:49.670 --> 06:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
provided until then um and that's where
 
06:11:51.590 --> 06:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make sure that we have
 
06:11:53.548 --> 06:11:53.558 align:start position:0%
covered so that services are provided to
 
06:11:55.990 --> 06:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
the student as soon as possible just
 
06:11:57.590 --> 06:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that the services are
 
06:12:00.190 --> 06:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
outlined in the IEP um and they're
 
06:12:02.030 --> 06:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
totally separate from
 
06:12:05.708 --> 06:12:05.718 align:start position:0%
theou um and so the whether or not you
 
06:12:09.510 --> 06:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
have a signed mou the district is
 
06:12:12.590 --> 06:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
obligated to provide those services and
 
06:12:14.070 --> 06:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
and that's what's happening in those
 
06:12:16.628 --> 06:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
places where there's not ass signed mou
 
06:12:18.590 --> 06:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
it's still going on I mean there the
 
06:12:21.270 --> 06:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
services are being provided to kids and
 
06:12:23.230 --> 06:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
the districts are just documenting their
 
06:12:26.628 --> 06:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
attempts to get those signatures on the
 
06:12:30.468 --> 06:12:30.478 align:start position:0%
you that's not quite what director white
 
06:12:33.030 --> 06:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
is is saying to me on
 
06:12:35.430 --> 06:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
online the other concern which we have
 
06:12:37.590 --> 06:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
if there's no mou it's difficult for the
 
06:12:41.070 --> 06:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
local re Lea to develop what
 
06:12:42.230 --> 06:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
expenditures they're going to have in
 
06:12:45.310 --> 06:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
their budget upcoming budget uh and
 
06:12:46.830 --> 06:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
reflecting exactly what has been said
 
06:12:48.070 --> 06:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
here is difficult for the school
 
06:12:49.948 --> 06:12:49.958 align:start position:0%
districts to budget those expenditures
 
06:12:52.310 --> 06:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
appropriately if there's
 
06:12:54.468 --> 06:12:54.478 align:start position:0%
noou and if we're hearing that there's
 
06:12:57.430 --> 06:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
some not having mou
 
06:12:59.548 --> 06:12:59.558 align:start position:0%
then I I'd like to know why there
 
06:13:02.788 --> 06:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
there's no us I'm I'm not concerned the
 
06:13:05.750 --> 06:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
date November one yes but it's led to me
 
06:13:08.830 --> 06:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
worrying now that there's other issues
 
06:13:11.670 --> 06:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
that are associated with this mou that
 
06:13:13.750 --> 06:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
may need a little bit of attention and
 
06:13:15.548 --> 06:13:15.558 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get more information from
 
06:13:19.510 --> 06:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
director white Melissa so that we could
 
06:13:22.270 --> 06:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
make a a a better decision come maybe
 
06:13:24.030 --> 06:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
next week when we're we're meeting this
 
06:13:25.390 --> 06:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
is not going to have to be taken up
 
06:13:28.110 --> 06:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
today but but it's unfortunately we've
 
06:13:29.788 --> 06:13:29.798 align:start position:0%
had 107 bills we haven't had the time to
 
06:13:32.270 --> 06:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
put into this and keep in mind I don't
 
06:13:33.990 --> 06:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
think that you know the date has nothing
 
06:13:37.910 --> 06:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
to do with the unsigned M and I I do
 
06:13:41.750 --> 06:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
believe it's a very small number ofus
 
06:13:44.110 --> 06:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
that aren't signed in terms of our
 
06:13:47.510 --> 06:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
conversations with the department and um
 
06:13:49.788 --> 06:13:49.798 align:start position:0%
I think that's you're right those that
 
06:13:52.230 --> 06:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
those small Pockets have to be ironed
 
06:13:54.390 --> 06:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
out I don't necessarily see that
 
06:13:57.708 --> 06:13:57.718 align:start position:0%
connected to the date
 
06:13:59.310 --> 06:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
but I see this possibly as being a
 
06:14:01.548 --> 06:14:01.558 align:start position:0%
vehicle to try and maybe help out with
 
06:14:03.510 --> 06:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
some of those other questions which we
 
06:14:06.310 --> 06:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
have without making modifications but to
 
06:14:07.868 --> 06:14:07.878 align:start position:0%
add something on they saying hey there's
 
06:14:09.110 --> 06:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
got to be a little bit of accountability
 
06:14:10.948 --> 06:14:10.958 align:start position:0%
here there's got to be anou signed if
 
06:14:13.430 --> 06:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
there's a a student over here or your
 
06:14:15.468 --> 06:14:15.478 align:start position:0%
providing Services over there well get
 
06:14:16.350 --> 06:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
it in
 
06:14:18.628 --> 06:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
place kind of makes legislature look
 
06:14:21.350 --> 06:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
like why did we pass this stuff to begin
 
06:14:25.270 --> 06:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
with don't answer that don't answer
 
06:14:25.280 --> 06:14:27.110 align:start position:0%
with don't answer that don't answer
that

06:14:27.110 --> 06:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:14:29.510 --> 06:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
represent Heath thank you Mr chair I
 
06:14:32.750 --> 06:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
really am reluctant to um I it sounds
 
06:14:36.150 --> 06:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
like things are getting into place I am
 
06:14:38.628 --> 06:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
concerned that you are thinking in terms
 
06:14:41.670 --> 06:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
of a penalty and I would hate to see any
 
06:14:44.350 --> 06:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
kind of a penalty imposed on one of our
 
06:14:46.190 --> 06:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
Char schools I'm not looking at a
 
06:14:48.230 --> 06:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
penalty thank you no I'm just trying to
 
06:14:50.788 --> 06:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:53.468 --> 06:14:53.478 align:start position:0%
information any other questions
 
06:14:57.390 --> 06:14:57.400 align:start position:0%

06:16:01.120 --> 06:16:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:16:06.830 --> 06:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:09.190 --> 06:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
easy I'd like to hold
 
06:16:12.190 --> 06:16:12.200 align:start position:0%
it we're we're we're gonna hold 1014
 
06:16:13.788 --> 06:16:13.798 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do it right
 
06:16:17.270 --> 06:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
now look at it Mr chair I'm just gonna
 
06:16:19.868 --> 06:16:19.878 align:start position:0%
distribute the if you want to discuss it
 
06:16:21.070 --> 06:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
yes but we're not going to take any
 
06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
action on it right now let's do that
 
06:16:25.910 --> 06:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
let's discuss it but not no motions on
 
06:16:28.948 --> 06:16:28.958 align:start position:0%
the table I won't accept
 
06:16:33.350 --> 06:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
them so represent Damon would you please
 
06:16:37.868 --> 06:16:37.878 align:start position:0%
explain what you have there on 10:14
 
06:16:39.430 --> 06:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
relative registration of high school
 
06:16:40.868 --> 06:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
students to
 
06:16:44.590 --> 06:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
vote yes thank you Mr chair so 10:14 on
 
06:16:46.070 --> 06:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
high school students to vote so the
 
06:16:48.468 --> 06:16:48.478 align:start position:0%
amendment that will come around is
 
06:16:50.948 --> 06:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
amendment number
 
06:16:53.510 --> 06:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
one2 this is not the same amendment that
 
06:16:54.990 --> 06:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
you have previously
 
06:16:57.590 --> 06:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
seen however it
 
06:17:02.150 --> 06:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
is um very similar the only difference
 
06:17:05.190 --> 06:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
between this and amendment number
 
06:17:08.948 --> 06:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
538 is that the new Amendment removes
 
06:17:08.958 --> 06:17:10.628 align:start position:0%
538 is that the new Amendment removes
private

06:17:10.628 --> 06:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
private
 
06:17:13.868 --> 06:17:13.878 align:start position:0%
schools so both
 
06:17:16.030 --> 06:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
amendments take
 
06:17:16.040 --> 06:17:17.868 align:start position:0%
amendments take
out

06:17:17.868 --> 06:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:17:20.230 --> 06:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
line8 in the original
 
06:17:24.070 --> 06:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
bill that line read or reads providing
 
06:17:26.350 --> 06:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
access to an assistance with filing
 
06:17:28.990 --> 06:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
registration applications so both
 
06:17:32.468 --> 06:17:32.478 align:start position:0%
versions of the amendment remove
 
06:17:32.478 --> 06:17:34.070 align:start position:0%
versions of the amendment remove
any

06:17:34.070 --> 06:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:17:38.590 --> 06:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
um request in policy to provide access
 
06:17:40.750 --> 06:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
or assistance with the actual filling
 
06:17:42.390 --> 06:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
out of
 
06:17:45.468 --> 06:17:45.478 align:start position:0%
applications um so essentially the bill
 
06:17:48.430 --> 06:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
with either amendment is simply to ask
 
06:17:54.070 --> 06:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:58.510 --> 06:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:58.520 --> 06:18:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:18:01.830 --> 06:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:04.270 --> 06:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
sure here's there's one more right
 
06:18:09.110 --> 06:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:13.468 --> 06:18:13.478 align:start position:0%
again everybody good I didn't keep one
 
06:18:15.670 --> 06:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
here it's fine
 
06:18:18.670 --> 06:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
06:18:21.390 --> 06:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
so amendment number
 
06:18:24.548 --> 06:18:24.558 align:start position:0%
one2 is the one I'm requesting we
 
06:18:26.910 --> 06:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
consider each School District shall
 
06:18:29.548 --> 06:18:29.558 align:start position:0%
adopt policies to promote voter
 
06:18:32.548 --> 06:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
registration it's just about saying have
 
06:18:32.558 --> 06:18:34.468 align:start position:0%
registration it's just about saying have
a

06:18:34.468 --> 06:18:34.478 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:18:36.868 --> 06:18:36.878 align:start position:0%
policy policies
 
06:18:41.190 --> 06:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
may not shall may include collaboration
 
06:18:42.910 --> 06:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
with the town or city clerk and the
 
06:18:44.788 --> 06:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist to conduct
 
06:18:46.788 --> 06:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
voter registration at high
 
06:18:49.350 --> 06:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
schools completion of voter registration
 
06:18:51.150 --> 06:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
shall not be a course requirement or
 
06:18:52.708 --> 06:18:52.718 align:start position:0%
graded assignment for
 
06:18:55.030 --> 06:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
students policies shall include
 
06:18:57.110 --> 06:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
informing students of state requirements
 
06:18:58.190 --> 06:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
for Boer
 
06:19:01.270 --> 06:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
registration so no private school no
 
06:19:03.628 --> 06:19:03.638 align:start position:0%
actual filling out of applications not
 
06:19:06.110 --> 06:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
unless the school chooses to collaborate
 
06:19:07.910 --> 06:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
in that way but it's not required in the
 
06:19:11.868 --> 06:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
policy it's just about making sure that
 
06:19:15.310 --> 06:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
every single public high school student
 
06:19:18.868 --> 06:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
is aware of how they become a voter
 
06:19:18.878 --> 06:19:21.670 align:start position:0%
is aware of how they become a voter
that's

06:19:21.670 --> 06:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:25.390 --> 06:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
all so this bill this amendment is
 
06:19:28.548 --> 06:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
saying to conduct registration of Voters
 
06:19:28.558 --> 06:19:30.670 align:start position:0%
saying to conduct registration of Voters
at

06:19:30.670 --> 06:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
at
 
06:19:33.510 --> 06:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
school no sir that is not
 
06:19:36.190 --> 06:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
correct what I'm reading on lines four
 
06:19:38.708 --> 06:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
and five to conduct voter registration
 
06:19:42.190 --> 06:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
in high schools it says may include
 
06:19:43.948 --> 06:19:43.958 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the town or city
 
06:19:45.708 --> 06:19:45.718 align:start position:0%
clerk doesn't mean they have to they
 
06:19:49.390 --> 06:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
don't have to do that they may do that
 
06:19:52.030 --> 06:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
okay all they have to do is have a
 
06:19:54.548 --> 06:19:54.558 align:start position:0%
policy that promotes student voter
 
06:19:56.708 --> 06:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
registration it could be as simple as
 
06:19:58.270 --> 06:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
the policy
 
06:20:02.150 --> 06:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
saying in civics class we will tell our
 
06:20:04.548 --> 06:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
students what documents they need to
 
06:20:07.310 --> 06:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
register to vote and who they need to
 
06:20:08.750 --> 06:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
contact to do
 
06:20:11.150 --> 06:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
06:20:13.708 --> 06:20:13.718 align:start position:0%
Belin thank you Mr J I guess this is a
 
06:20:15.628 --> 06:20:15.638 align:start position:0%
question to help clarify because I I
 
06:20:19.868 --> 06:20:19.878 align:start position:0%
noticed it specifically prohibits graded
 
06:20:21.990 --> 06:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
assignments but is there such a thing as
 
06:20:24.190 --> 06:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
a non-graded assignment or just an
 
06:20:25.868 --> 06:20:25.878 align:start position:0%
assignment that is attached to a
 
06:20:27.430 --> 06:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
competency and not graded or something
 
06:20:31.948 --> 06:20:31.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:34.990 --> 06:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
effect I would defer to the folks who
 
06:20:37.030 --> 06:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
are Educators to help me with the answer
 
06:20:37.040 --> 06:20:43.310 align:start position:0%
are Educators to help me with the answer
to

06:20:43.310 --> 06:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:46.350 --> 06:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
that representative Tanner answer that
 
06:20:46.360 --> 06:20:47.708 align:start position:0%
that representative Tanner answer that
representative

06:20:47.708 --> 06:20:47.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:20:50.468 --> 06:20:50.478 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you I think that it says
 
06:20:52.708 --> 06:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
that it shall not be a course
 
06:20:56.468 --> 06:20:56.478 align:start position:0%
requirement um that means that
 
06:20:58.830 --> 06:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
or a graded assignment that you could
 
06:21:03.990 --> 06:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
have work work um books or work sheets
 
06:21:05.830 --> 06:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
that people fill out but it wouldn't be
 
06:21:08.628 --> 06:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
something that was required or
 
06:21:13.788 --> 06:21:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:16.110 --> 06:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
in just to further clarify that though
 
06:21:17.670 --> 06:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
it does leave open the possibility that
 
06:21:19.590 --> 06:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
teacher could assign it say write this
 
06:21:21.310 --> 06:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
up on the board say that you you have
 
06:21:23.190 --> 06:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
we're asking you to do this but it's not
 
06:21:25.670 --> 06:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
graded or anything else can I respond
 
06:21:29.548 --> 06:21:29.558 align:start position:0%
respond yes I would say that if I I
 
06:21:32.110 --> 06:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
would never uh as a teacher I would
 
06:21:36.190 --> 06:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
never say that that way it would be U
 
06:21:38.270 --> 06:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
like a worksheet that's passed out and
 
06:21:41.750 --> 06:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
say this is not required or graded um
 
06:21:44.390 --> 06:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
look it over you don't have to turn it
 
06:21:47.430 --> 06:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
in I mean that's that's how you kind of
 
06:21:49.390 --> 06:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
do if you were going to if you were
 
06:21:51.030 --> 06:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
going to do something that you're afraid
 
06:21:53.070 --> 06:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
that they're going to do that's that's
 
06:21:57.628 --> 06:21:57.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:01.350 --> 06:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
yes repr yeah to me
 
06:22:04.910 --> 06:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
um we've talked a lot in this committee
 
06:22:06.548 --> 06:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
about Civics
 
06:22:06.558 --> 06:22:08.310 align:start position:0%
about Civics
education

06:22:08.310 --> 06:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
education
 
06:22:13.070 --> 06:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
right isn't this the end of civics
 
06:22:15.910 --> 06:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
education like how to
 
06:22:19.468 --> 06:22:19.478 align:start position:0%
vote and get
 
06:22:23.548 --> 06:22:23.558 align:start position:0%
involved I mean this is so simple to me
 
06:22:25.910 --> 06:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
as part of whatever curriculum I'm going
 
06:22:28.670 --> 06:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
to be teaching is I'm going to be able
 
06:22:30.830 --> 06:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
to tell students here's how you go out
 
06:22:33.350 --> 06:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
and vote and stop telling who you should
 
06:22:37.070 --> 06:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
vote for or how uh what candidate you
 
06:22:38.948 --> 06:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
ought to vote it's just go out and
 
06:22:40.868 --> 06:22:40.878 align:start position:0%
register and
 
06:22:43.990 --> 06:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
vote to me I I don't know why we have a
 
06:22:47.788 --> 06:22:47.798 align:start position:0%
problem with this if in fact we believe
 
06:22:49.830 --> 06:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
in what we've already done in the whole
 
06:22:53.788 --> 06:22:53.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:56.628 --> 06:22:56.638 align:start position:0%

06:23:48.468 --> 06:23:48.478 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you Mr chair um this is we
 
06:23:51.708 --> 06:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
have a problem and that problem is we
 
06:23:53.230 --> 06:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
have over
 
06:23:56.590 --> 06:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
16,000 18 year olds in New Hampshire
 
06:23:56.600 --> 06:23:58.270 align:start position:0%
16,000 18 year olds in New Hampshire
16,000

06:23:58.270 --> 06:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
16,000
 
06:24:02.070 --> 06:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
15.6% of them registered to vote in 20
 
06:24:06.110 --> 06:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
in the in 2223 at the close
 
06:24:09.670 --> 06:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
15.6% nationally that's
 
06:24:09.680 --> 06:24:12.468 align:start position:0%
15.6% nationally that's
30.6%

06:24:12.468 --> 06:24:12.478 align:start position:0%
30.6%
 
06:24:15.468 --> 06:24:15.478 align:start position:0%
double of the 18y olds who are
 
06:24:19.628 --> 06:24:19.638 align:start position:0%
registered to vote 83% of them do vote
 
06:24:22.230 --> 06:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
so we need more kids to register to vote
 
06:24:25.948 --> 06:24:25.958 align:start position:0%
so they can engage in it be involved in
 
06:24:28.468 --> 06:24:28.478 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement which I believe we all
 
06:24:34.788 --> 06:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
support um so I I I think this bill
 
06:24:37.788 --> 06:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
supports getting more kids to register
 
06:24:41.590 --> 06:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
to vote informing them and having them
 
06:24:41.600 --> 06:24:43.830 align:start position:0%
to vote informing them and having them
do

06:24:43.830 --> 06:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:47.350 --> 06:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
it further discussion on this amendment
 
06:24:47.360 --> 06:24:49.270 align:start position:0%
it further discussion on this amendment
represent

06:24:49.270 --> 06:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
represent
 
06:24:51.628 --> 06:24:51.638 align:start position:0%
Damon so I think you all have heard me
 
06:24:53.590 --> 06:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously that I'm mentoring
 
06:24:56.468 --> 06:24:56.478 align:start position:0%
a sunap high school senior on her senior
 
06:24:59.510 --> 06:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
project which is on local voter
 
06:25:02.830 --> 06:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
engagement and she's a bright fun
 
06:25:05.990 --> 06:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
interesting young woman she texted me
 
06:25:09.110 --> 06:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
this morning has the bill come up yet I
 
06:25:12.468 --> 06:25:12.478 align:start position:0%
said no but I think today um she just
 
06:25:14.628 --> 06:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
went to her town so she goes to school
 
06:25:17.270 --> 06:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
in son but she lives in lemster to
 
06:25:20.070 --> 06:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
lemster's school meeting last week for
 
06:25:22.990 --> 06:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
the first time that she had attended um
 
06:25:27.830 --> 06:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
the annual event and her takeaway was
 
06:25:30.510 --> 06:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
there are so few people participating
 
06:25:32.590 --> 06:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
and so few of the people who are
 
06:25:34.270 --> 06:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
participating understand what their
 
06:25:36.628 --> 06:25:36.638 align:start position:0%
level of responsibility is and how to do
 
06:25:39.310 --> 06:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
this she's totally
 
06:25:42.750 --> 06:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
motivated to work on this and and this
 
06:25:45.750 --> 06:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
bill is so a model of what we want we
 
06:25:48.750 --> 06:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
want I think all of us when I say
 
06:25:53.030 --> 06:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
we to have young people
 
06:25:55.510 --> 06:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to
 
06:25:58.788 --> 06:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
participate in democracy that's all this
 
06:26:02.750 --> 06:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
is this is just a very simple invitation
 
06:26:07.070 --> 06:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
to the students to make it clear to them
 
06:26:13.230 --> 06:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:16.270 --> 06:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
vote representa but the way I read this
 
06:26:18.390 --> 06:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
in actuality it's not just providing
 
06:26:20.830 --> 06:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
information it's also perhaps providing
 
06:26:24.350 --> 06:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
the opportunity with respect to the May
 
06:26:24.360 --> 06:26:25.868 align:start position:0%
the opportunity with respect to the May
collaborate

06:26:25.868 --> 06:26:25.878 align:start position:0%
collaborate
 
06:26:29.310 --> 06:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
with the uh town uh or city officials in
 
06:26:31.390 --> 06:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
actually conducting the registration and
 
06:26:34.548 --> 06:26:34.558 align:start position:0%
being and doing it on site
 
06:26:37.750 --> 06:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
traditionally uh I have understood voter
 
06:26:40.310 --> 06:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
registration uh schools to provide
 
06:26:43.230 --> 06:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
education to students information but
 
06:26:45.310 --> 06:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to actually lead them to
 
06:26:47.230 --> 06:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
the point where they're actually in this
 
06:26:50.510 --> 06:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
instance registering to vote uh this was
 
06:26:52.750 --> 06:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
something in my life experience where my
 
06:26:56.708 --> 06:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
parents actually uh saw as their role as
 
06:26:59.670 --> 06:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
parents to impress upon me the need to
 
06:27:02.708 --> 06:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
register as a voter what we're doing yet
 
06:27:06.150 --> 06:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
again is we are replacing parents with
 
06:27:09.270 --> 06:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
the school and saying that the primary
 
06:27:12.030 --> 06:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility de facto may be shifting
 
06:27:15.548 --> 06:27:15.558 align:start position:0%
to the school to register s students to
 
06:27:18.150 --> 06:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
vote at the age of 18 rather than to
 
06:27:20.190 --> 06:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
have it be a personal responsibility or
 
06:27:22.948 --> 06:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
one that is fostered by the parents in
 
06:27:26.150 --> 06:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
the parental role so so um I'm I'm
 
06:27:28.030 --> 06:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about that if you strike that
 
06:27:31.310 --> 06:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
one sentence I I could live with this
 
06:27:34.510 --> 06:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
but uh putting the school in the role of
 
06:27:37.670 --> 06:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
actually uh taking the place of the
 
06:27:41.990 --> 06:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
parents is troubling to me thank
 
06:27:46.070 --> 06:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:49.468 --> 06:27:49.478 align:start position:0%
Damon I think those of us who have the
 
06:27:52.670 --> 06:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
great Good Fortune to have parents or
 
06:27:55.548 --> 06:27:55.558 align:start position:0%
grandparents or other people
 
06:27:58.708 --> 06:27:58.718 align:start position:0%
who guided us to as representative Terry
 
06:28:02.430 --> 06:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
just spoke to become voters are
 
06:28:02.440 --> 06:28:03.548 align:start position:0%
just spoke to become voters are
immensely

06:28:03.548 --> 06:28:03.558 align:start position:0%
immensely
 
06:28:07.628 --> 06:28:07.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:11.030 --> 06:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
everyone represent Hall thank you IEX
 
06:28:13.350 --> 06:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not one of those I grew up in a
 
06:28:16.430 --> 06:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
household with two parents lived in
 
06:28:19.110 --> 06:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
lived in New Hampshire for 60 years
 
06:28:21.270 --> 06:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
never became citizens so if you and they
 
06:28:23.590 --> 06:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
never could vote so if you think they
 
06:28:25.670 --> 06:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
encourag me to register to vote
 
06:28:28.150 --> 06:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
not true thank
 
06:28:30.510 --> 06:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Bel then representa
 
06:28:33.190 --> 06:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr chair I I heard a
 
06:28:35.150 --> 06:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
statement made that we have a problem in
 
06:28:37.190 --> 06:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
this state and in this country regarding
 
06:28:39.990 --> 06:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
some of the voter statistics but I would
 
06:28:42.948 --> 06:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
like to hear any reasonable rationale
 
06:28:45.150 --> 06:28:45.160 align:start position:0%
for why it is within the purview of this
 
06:28:47.868 --> 06:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
committee to tell any person any citizen
 
06:28:49.830 --> 06:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
who decides of their own free will that
 
06:28:53.910 --> 06:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
they don't want to vote that they are a
 
06:28:56.830 --> 06:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
problem Peron Woodcock thank you
 
06:29:00.510 --> 06:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
chairman Le I don't think this this bill
 
06:29:03.590 --> 06:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
forces youngsters to register to vote it
 
06:29:04.708 --> 06:29:04.718 align:start position:0%
gives them the
 
06:29:07.390 --> 06:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity um and I'm not sure
 
06:29:08.990 --> 06:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
represent Terry is aware of this since
 
06:29:11.350 --> 06:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
he just joined a couple weeks ago but
 
06:29:13.310 --> 06:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
students in high schools all through New
 
06:29:15.548 --> 06:29:15.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have been doing this and
 
06:29:17.590 --> 06:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
schools been doing this for a long time
 
06:29:19.548 --> 06:29:19.558 align:start position:0%
in multiple schools where at the end of
 
06:29:22.310 --> 06:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
the year there's the registar from the
 
06:29:24.948 --> 06:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
town will clerk will come in and have a
 
06:29:26.910 --> 06:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
booth there and some signs up and if
 
06:29:27.990 --> 06:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
students want to vote to give the
 
06:29:29.390 --> 06:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make them more convenient
 
06:29:31.390 --> 06:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
like we often bring food to the school
 
06:29:33.110 --> 06:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
to make them more convenient for them or
 
06:29:34.468 --> 06:29:34.478 align:start position:0%
textbook sometimes to make them more
 
06:29:35.430 --> 06:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
convenient for them if they don't have
 
06:29:37.030 --> 06:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
them at home this is just another
 
06:29:39.070 --> 06:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
another supplement as an option for
 
06:29:41.190 --> 06:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
youngsters uh to do
 
06:29:45.230 --> 06:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
that thank you many many many years ago
 
06:29:48.430 --> 06:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
we had a bill which dealt
 
06:29:51.628 --> 06:29:51.638 align:start position:0%
with tuition rates for kids to go to UNH
 
06:29:53.230 --> 06:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
Keen or
 
06:29:57.230 --> 06:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and we allow and it dealt with
 
06:30:00.390 --> 06:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
the kids which had grown up in New
 
06:30:03.070 --> 06:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gone through Elementary Middle
 
06:30:05.110 --> 06:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
School high schools in New Hampshire but
 
06:30:07.230 --> 06:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
their parents had come over after World
 
06:30:10.310 --> 06:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
War II and were not
 
06:30:13.390 --> 06:30:13.400 align:start position:0%
citizens the kids did not learn that
 
06:30:16.590 --> 06:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
they were not citizens because they came
 
06:30:17.708 --> 06:30:17.718 align:start position:0%
with their
 
06:30:21.750 --> 06:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
parents until 18 age 18 and therefore
 
06:30:25.350 --> 06:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
they did not get instate tuition at unh
 
06:30:27.670 --> 06:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
and UNH has a policy that you have to be
 
06:30:30.030 --> 06:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
a citizen of this
 
06:30:33.310 --> 06:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
state so what about all those students
 
06:30:35.270 --> 06:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
which are coming in because we can't say
 
06:30:36.750 --> 06:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
to a student wanting to walk in the
 
06:30:39.310 --> 06:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
doors at those schools in Manchester you
 
06:30:41.590 --> 06:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
can't enroll unless you're a citizen of
 
06:30:43.670 --> 06:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
the United States your enrollment would
 
06:30:45.948 --> 06:30:45.958 align:start position:0%
probably decrease a sign significant
 
06:30:48.910 --> 06:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
amount of students so what about those
 
06:30:50.628 --> 06:30:50.638 align:start position:0%
students which are in this class who
 
06:30:51.948 --> 06:30:51.958 align:start position:0%
want to register vote but I can't
 
06:30:54.788 --> 06:30:54.798 align:start position:0%
register vote because I'm not a citizen
 
06:30:56.868 --> 06:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:30:58.708 --> 06:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
discriminatory I would suggest it's a
 
06:31:00.430 --> 06:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
wonderful time for them to find out in
 
06:31:02.030 --> 06:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
the opportunity how to move on that's
 
06:31:03.830 --> 06:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
why it's Civics and then they go back to
 
06:31:05.830 --> 06:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
their parents and we had one student
 
06:31:07.548 --> 06:31:07.558 align:start position:0%
come in who was Val Victorian of the
 
06:31:10.990 --> 06:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
class who was not a
 
06:31:13.070 --> 06:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
citizen that couldn't get instate
 
06:31:13.080 --> 06:31:15.110 align:start position:0%
citizen that couldn't get instate
tuition

06:31:15.110 --> 06:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
06:31:18.270 --> 06:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
UNH you know who it was I thought I
 
06:31:21.948 --> 06:31:21.958 align:start position:0%
heard somebody say the Damon Mr chair
 
06:31:25.350 --> 06:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
with respect we would just be
 
06:31:28.510 --> 06:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
providing the facts to both the students
 
06:31:31.548 --> 06:31:31.558 align:start position:0%
who are eligible to register to vote and
 
06:31:34.110 --> 06:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
to those students who are not eligible
 
06:31:37.230 --> 06:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
because they're not American
 
06:31:40.110 --> 06:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
citizens and as representative Woodcock
 
06:31:42.350 --> 06:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
noted those latter students could then
 
06:31:44.468 --> 06:31:44.478 align:start position:0%
decide they want to become citizens or
 
06:31:47.070 --> 06:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
not that is obviously their
 
06:31:50.270 --> 06:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
choice we're not we're simply providing
 
06:31:53.670 --> 06:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
the facts we're we're not doing anything
 
06:31:53.680 --> 06:31:55.468 align:start position:0%
the facts we're we're not doing anything
discriminatory

06:31:55.468 --> 06:31:55.478 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
06:31:57.990 --> 06:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
informing about that I I I agree with
 
06:31:59.190 --> 06:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
what I heard on the other side of the
 
06:32:01.868 --> 06:32:01.878 align:start position:0%
room here to my left where I think it
 
06:32:03.430 --> 06:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
should be a part of what we're doing in
 
06:32:06.510 --> 06:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
our Civics education we should be
 
06:32:08.590 --> 06:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
teaching kids that we want them they
 
06:32:11.510 --> 06:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
live in a democracy and it's we're as
 
06:32:13.910 --> 06:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
strong as a democracy as our
 
06:32:16.190 --> 06:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
participation in it and so that should
 
06:32:18.868 --> 06:32:18.878 align:start position:0%
be a part of and being a voter is very
 
06:32:21.230 --> 06:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
important but to take it to the next
 
06:32:24.110 --> 06:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
step and do the registration at the
 
06:32:24.120 --> 06:32:25.230 align:start position:0%
step and do the registration at the
school

06:32:25.230 --> 06:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:32:27.070 --> 06:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
rather than doing it through the process
 
06:32:29.468 --> 06:32:29.478 align:start position:0%
which has been established I agree I
 
06:32:30.990 --> 06:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
think we're taking something out of the
 
06:32:32.910 --> 06:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
hands which really belong in the other
 
06:32:36.350 --> 06:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
party the parent and and uh I think the
 
06:32:38.270 --> 06:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
school has an obligation to teach this
 
06:32:39.670 --> 06:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
in our Civics
 
06:32:42.468 --> 06:32:42.478 align:start position:0%
classes and that's where I'd far prefer
 
06:32:45.150 --> 06:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
to see this type of language put
 
06:32:47.590 --> 06:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
underneath the studies of civic
 
06:32:49.510 --> 06:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
education represent hall and then
 
06:32:51.670 --> 06:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
represent wood thank you can I just
 
06:32:53.990 --> 06:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
clarification did you actually just say
 
06:32:56.628 --> 06:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
that you disagree with any of this voter
 
06:32:58.230 --> 06:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
registration going on in schools right
 
06:32:59.990 --> 06:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
now with all the towns that do it that
 
06:33:01.468 --> 06:33:01.478 align:start position:0%
you disagree with that that that should
 
06:33:03.350 --> 06:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
not happen I believe registration should
 
06:33:05.350 --> 06:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
not occur in schools I believe
 
06:33:06.910 --> 06:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
registration should occur at the
 
06:33:09.990 --> 06:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
registration booth in the clerk's office
 
06:33:12.270 --> 06:33:12.280 align:start position:0%
or with the supervisor checklist we need
 
06:33:15.030 --> 06:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
to be teaching the importance of of of
 
06:33:17.830 --> 06:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
being a registered voter at school but
 
06:33:19.628 --> 06:33:19.638 align:start position:0%
that practice of registering them I
 
06:33:21.628 --> 06:33:21.638 align:start position:0%
would prefer to see outside the school
 
06:33:26.708 --> 06:33:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:29.388 --> 06:33:29.398 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you um I'm thinking as
 
06:33:31.110 --> 06:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the youngster who
 
06:33:35.468 --> 06:33:35.478 align:start position:0%
rebelled Victorian was um not a citizen
 
06:33:38.230 --> 06:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
and yet we've put in place for every
 
06:33:40.070 --> 06:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
single youngster that they have to take
 
06:33:42.388 --> 06:33:42.398 align:start position:0%
the immigration Naturalization test no
 
06:33:44.190 --> 06:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
matter where you come from if you come
 
06:33:46.150 --> 06:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
from America take an naturalization test
 
06:33:47.948 --> 06:33:47.958 align:start position:0%
take an immigration test cuz we said you
 
06:33:50.310 --> 06:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
need to do it and we're doing it here
 
06:33:52.510 --> 06:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
we're just talk about voting simple
 
06:33:55.310 --> 06:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
simple this case and that young would be
 
06:33:57.868 --> 06:33:57.878 align:start position:0%
perfect can test sh and get us voting
 
06:34:00.990 --> 06:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
registra at the same time represent
 
06:34:03.948 --> 06:34:03.958 align:start position:0%
Terry yes uh thank you uh I'm not going
 
06:34:06.830 --> 06:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
to uh raise my voice and be impassioned
 
06:34:10.430 --> 06:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
at this point but I I am somewhat uh
 
06:34:15.270 --> 06:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
concerned that um I'm I'm envisioning
 
06:34:18.708 --> 06:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
myself at the school at the age of 18 on
 
06:34:22.030 --> 06:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
the day that the uh voter registration
 
06:34:24.628 --> 06:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
uh might take place under the provisions
 
06:34:28.670 --> 06:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
of this of this uh Bill my social SEC my
 
06:34:30.990 --> 06:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
my social SEC my social studies teacher
 
06:34:33.190 --> 06:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
is an avowed Democrat and has let all of
 
06:34:34.910 --> 06:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
us know in the class during the year
 
06:34:36.628 --> 06:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
that that he's a Democrat and this in
 
06:34:39.628 --> 06:34:39.638 align:start position:0%
fact was the case when I was in school
 
06:34:43.590 --> 06:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
back in the day I'm a Democrat we have
 
06:34:46.388 --> 06:34:46.398 align:start position:0%
peer pressure with kids we want to do
 
06:34:48.270 --> 06:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
what your friends are doing and they're
 
06:34:49.830 --> 06:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
all going to register as Democrats and
 
06:34:51.468 --> 06:34:51.478 align:start position:0%
so I registered as a Democrat now I'm
 
06:34:53.190 --> 06:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
sure that'll bring joy I see the smiles
 
06:34:54.708 --> 06:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
on the side on the faces of my
 
06:34:56.230 --> 06:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues across the a they're really
 
06:34:58.708 --> 06:34:58.718 align:start position:0%
thrilled and but I'll tell you this I
 
06:35:00.590 --> 06:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
come home hey hey let's have some order
 
06:35:03.110 --> 06:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
here now he has I have the floor repres
 
06:35:05.628 --> 06:35:05.638 align:start position:0%
repres excuse me I have the floor so I
 
06:35:08.468 --> 06:35:08.478 align:start position:0%
come home from school that day and I
 
06:35:10.910 --> 06:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
announced to my parents that I became a
 
06:35:13.708 --> 06:35:13.718 align:start position:0%
Democrat at voter registration at school
 
06:35:15.110 --> 06:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
which they didn't even know about was
 
06:35:17.948 --> 06:35:17.958 align:start position:0%
taking place that day uh because all of
 
06:35:20.150 --> 06:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
my friends registered as Democrats and I
 
06:35:22.468 --> 06:35:22.478 align:start position:0%
wanted to be cool and and therefore be
 
06:35:24.868 --> 06:35:24.878 align:start position:0%
one of them and uh by by the way my
 
06:35:27.388 --> 06:35:27.398 align:start position:0%
teacher is is a Democrat and I'm sure
 
06:35:29.510 --> 06:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
that'll help my grade as well this is
 
06:35:31.948 --> 06:35:31.958 align:start position:0%
the reasoning of an 18-year-old and it's
 
06:35:34.070 --> 06:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
not an unreasonable reasoning of an
 
06:35:36.388 --> 06:35:36.398 align:start position:0%
18-year-old and anyone who would suggest
 
06:35:39.670 --> 06:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
that it's not a a possible reasoning of
 
06:35:42.388 --> 06:35:42.398 align:start position:0%
an 18-year-old has no idea how an
 
06:35:45.388 --> 06:35:45.398 align:start position:0%
18-year-old reasons and has no idea what
 
06:35:47.430 --> 06:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
goes on in the minds and in the hearts
 
06:35:50.030 --> 06:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
and the lives of children of that age
 
06:35:51.510 --> 06:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
and you can shake your head all you want
 
06:35:53.510 --> 06:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
but that's the truth thank you thank you
 
06:35:55.948 --> 06:35:55.958 align:start position:0%
very much
 
06:35:58.910 --> 06:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
we began today by talking about how we
 
06:36:01.310 --> 06:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
are set a historic record for the number
 
06:36:03.110 --> 06:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
of bills that have come through our
 
06:36:05.030 --> 06:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee and one of the things that I
 
06:36:06.948 --> 06:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
frequently tell people is we have too
 
06:36:10.868 --> 06:36:10.878 align:start position:0%
many laws there is lots of duplication
 
06:36:13.708 --> 06:36:13.718 align:start position:0%
in the education statutes already this
 
06:36:16.830 --> 06:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
bill this bill is covered in
 
06:36:21.910 --> 06:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
18911 Roman numeral 1 f it is covered in
 
06:36:26.190 --> 06:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
18922 it is covered in 189 923 we do not
 
06:36:27.190 --> 06:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
need a
 
06:36:30.788 --> 06:36:30.798 align:start position:0%
fourth piece of legislation that tells
 
06:36:33.310 --> 06:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
student teachers teachers puts the
 
06:36:35.990 --> 06:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
burden on the teachers that they need to
 
06:36:37.990 --> 06:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
do yet another thing when we've already
 
06:36:41.270 --> 06:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
covered it three places in the
 
06:36:43.310 --> 06:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
statute represent
 
06:36:48.868 --> 06:36:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:51.830 --> 06:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
chair I believe this bill does not
 
06:36:54.830 --> 06:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
demand registration
 
06:36:57.670 --> 06:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
it merely States how do you do
 
06:36:59.788 --> 06:36:59.798 align:start position:0%
it number
 
06:37:03.590 --> 06:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
one secondly in regarding to the charge
 
06:37:08.110 --> 06:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
that teachers will influence uh how
 
06:37:10.310 --> 06:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
individuals are going to vote totally
 
06:37:11.548 --> 06:37:11.558 align:start position:0%
disagree with
 
06:37:14.868 --> 06:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
that several years ago many years
 
06:37:17.788 --> 06:37:17.798 align:start position:0%
ago I was involved in the development of
 
06:37:20.548 --> 06:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
the 26th Amendment to the US
 
06:37:22.708 --> 06:37:22.718 align:start position:0%
Constitution you all know what that is
 
06:37:25.388 --> 06:37:25.398 align:start position:0%
right 18 y old
 
06:37:28.310 --> 06:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
vote at the time that we were working on
 
06:37:33.030 --> 06:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
that and lobbying for it the charge was
 
06:37:35.430 --> 06:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
made that oh well you're going to have
 
06:37:37.548 --> 06:37:37.558 align:start position:0%
this influence Etc you know what
 
06:37:40.150 --> 06:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
happened when the registrations came in
 
06:37:43.030 --> 06:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
and the reports after that came in they
 
06:37:44.788 --> 06:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
basically registered the same way their
 
06:37:44.798 --> 06:37:46.350 align:start position:0%
basically registered the same way their
parents

06:37:46.350 --> 06:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
parents
 
06:37:49.510 --> 06:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
did interesting isn't it wasn't what a
 
06:37:52.190 --> 06:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
teacher said but it was the impact of
 
06:37:55.350 --> 06:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
the family that's how they voted so
 
06:37:57.468 --> 06:37:57.478 align:start position:0%
those who were concerned about a flood
 
06:37:59.830 --> 06:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
for one party or another party totally
 
06:38:02.670 --> 06:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
was dismissed by that because they voted
 
06:38:04.788 --> 06:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
how their parents did in my sense is
 
06:38:05.830 --> 06:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's the same thing that's going to
 
06:38:07.150 --> 06:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
happen here it's not going to be based
 
06:38:07.160 --> 06:38:07.990 align:start position:0%
happen here it's not going to be based
upon

06:38:07.990 --> 06:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
upon
 
06:38:11.510 --> 06:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
peer I mean I I I am I am
 
06:38:13.868 --> 06:38:13.878 align:start position:0%
stunned by this
 
06:38:16.310 --> 06:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
conversation and we have spent so much
 
06:38:18.948 --> 06:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
time talking about Civics education as
 
06:38:21.388 --> 06:38:21.398 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock said we demanded
 
06:38:22.350 --> 06:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
that they have to take the
 
06:38:25.548 --> 06:38:25.558 align:start position:0%
naturalization test put another burden
 
06:38:27.788 --> 06:38:27.798 align:start position:0%
on students to do that all we're saying
 
06:38:30.830 --> 06:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
here is here's how you do it guys go do
 
06:38:32.548 --> 06:38:32.558 align:start position:0%
it we're not bringing it into the
 
06:38:34.830 --> 06:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
schools some may decide to do that but
 
06:38:37.150 --> 06:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
that's a local decision by a school
 
06:38:40.430 --> 06:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
board this law does not this proposal
 
06:38:43.948 --> 06:38:43.958 align:start position:0%
does not demand that at all it just says
 
06:38:46.590 --> 06:38:46.600 align:start position:0%
here's how you do it
 
06:38:48.830 --> 06:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
folks I I I'm
 
06:38:51.430 --> 06:38:51.440 align:start position:0%

06:38:56.270 --> 06:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
get this off the Record we know where we
 
06:39:07.990 --> 06:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:10.270 --> 06:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
representative hold it I'm through with
 
06:39:11.590 --> 06:39:11.600 align:start position:0%

representative Pell gave a um a couple
 
06:39:32.590 --> 06:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
of of Statute Illusions in her talk just
 
06:39:35.110 --> 06:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
a second ago but she didn't read what it
 
06:39:38.270 --> 06:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
says this is about distribution the
 
06:39:40.310 --> 06:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education is hereby
 
06:39:42.350 --> 06:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
directed to distribute copies of the
 
06:39:45.628 --> 06:39:45.638 align:start position:0%
State Constitution and election laws to
 
06:39:47.510 --> 06:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
all teachers of history and Civics in
 
06:39:49.708 --> 06:39:49.718 align:start position:0%

06:39:51.830 --> 06:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
and to teachers of US history in Junior
 
06:39:54.430 --> 06:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
and senior high schools to be used by
 
06:39:56.670 --> 06:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
them in instructing their pupils
 
06:39:59.750 --> 06:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
relative to the laws governing election
 
06:40:03.590 --> 06:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
and voting it's already there and it's a
 
06:40:07.788 --> 06:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
command distribute this teach it
 
06:40:11.948 --> 06:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
done yeah I agree with you represent
 
06:40:14.270 --> 06:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair previously I
 
06:40:15.548 --> 06:40:15.558 align:start position:0%
spoke a bit to the amendment I didn't
 
06:40:16.868 --> 06:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
want to go too much into the underlying
 
06:40:18.190 --> 06:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
bill but there was a
 
06:40:20.510 --> 06:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
question why should students not be
 
06:40:21.948 --> 06:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
registered at school and I'd like to
 
06:40:24.430 --> 06:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
take that question so there's two
 
06:40:26.430 --> 06:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
different types of discrimination the
 
06:40:29.150 --> 06:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
first type of discrimination is very
 
06:40:33.310 --> 06:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
obvious it is discriminating against
 
06:40:35.948 --> 06:40:35.958 align:start position:0%
people the second type of discrimination
 
06:40:38.230 --> 06:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
is not nearly as obvious but it is just
 
06:40:40.830 --> 06:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
as pernicious and that is discriminating
 
06:40:44.150 --> 06:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
for people and unless we're going to
 
06:40:48.910 --> 06:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
bring this to all populations not just
 
06:40:52.628 --> 06:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
schools but the 70-year-old couple up in
 
06:40:54.510 --> 06:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
the rural part of my dist who has to
 
06:40:58.590 --> 06:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
drive 20 mi to register it is unfair to
 
06:41:02.388 --> 06:41:02.398 align:start position:0%
discriminate for one population against
 
06:41:02.398 --> 06:41:05.190 align:start position:0%
discriminate for one population against
any

06:41:05.190 --> 06:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:07.670 --> 06:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
others representa whitcock yes thank you
 
06:41:09.310 --> 06:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
just just a point of information uh
 
06:41:10.708 --> 06:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
representative Heath went because you
 
06:41:12.830 --> 06:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
said 4:00 time limit and that you were
 
06:41:14.708 --> 06:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
not going to vote that's right we are
 
06:41:17.628 --> 06:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
then that's I already mentioned that
 
06:41:20.910 --> 06:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah we're after four o'clock
 
06:41:24.708 --> 06:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
represent C cordelli thank you uh just
 
06:41:27.510 --> 06:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
following up on uh representative dr's
 
06:41:30.670 --> 06:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
reading of that statute um I think that
