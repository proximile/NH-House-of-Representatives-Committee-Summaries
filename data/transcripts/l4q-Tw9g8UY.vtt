guests I I wanted to offer uh just sort
 
00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 align:start position:0%
of some admin overview things
 
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
um keep in mind that uh this is uh we're
 
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 align:start position:0%
we're streaming live
 
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
are do you know if the machines turned
 
00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:08.869 align:start position:0%
are do you know if the machines turned
on

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay how do I tell am I supposed to be
 
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
able to see and see a red light up there
 
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
or something or how to
 
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
okay I I mean I know I we don't need to
 
00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
do that right now but it would be nice
 
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
if I could self-identify if we're turned
 
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.910 align:start position:0%
if I could self-identify if we're turned
on

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
oh that is brilliant
 
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
that is so smart
 
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
oh okay good good good
 
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
um okay because we're virtual I just
 
00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 align:start position:0%
want to remind everyone of uh microphone
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
discipline you know try to really lean
 
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
into and talk talk into the microphone
 
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
the red light means you're on
 
00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
um if anyone wants handouts they're
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
available digitally online
 
00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 align:start position:0%
um do you want to say how to find them
 
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
I know there is a division division link
 
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
uh website Mr Ripple sent it around if
 
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
anybody would like to have me distribute
 
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
it I will do that but it is on the
 
00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.289 align:start position:0%
it I will do that but it is on the
website

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I mostly was thinking for the
 
00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 align:start position:0%
anyone who may be watching us stream if
 
00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 align:start position:0%
they wanted to go navigate to the to the
 
00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.110 align:start position:0%
they wanted to go navigate to the to the
website

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
um all right Mr chair is there a way
 
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
that the link can be put somewhere in
 
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
the notes on our stream for those
 
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to do that through
 
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
um the YouTube but if we could put it in
 
00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 align:start position:0%
the comments that would be great for the
 
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
users uh thank you I don't I don't know
 
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
anything unless Mr Ripple is here is uh
 
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
unfortunate truth so
 
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
um and then on the microphone if you
 
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
when you do talk get get more into it if
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't mind
 
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
um so miss Mr Ripple while you were out
 
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative Hull had a idea on making
 
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
sure the public can see easily where the
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
handouts are is there some way on the on
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
the streaming to put the link to the
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
where the documents are
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
I'm I could check with gcts and see if
 
00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 align:start position:0%
they can do that I'm not sure okay again
 
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
not not urgent not now just you know
 
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
just kind of Futures okay and and then
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know the if since we're streaming
 
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
this is going to be on an on uh on our
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
archive so people can will be able to
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
come back and and and watch this later
 
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh and so uh I just want to remind us
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
all that uh we want we want to manage
 
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
and maintain our uh decorum
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I'm willing to uh
 
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
experiment with and I'm kind of happy
 
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
with is is based on how this committee
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
has worked in the past if you have
 
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
questions for a witness all you need to
 
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
do is is let me know that you got two
 
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
three questions or something uh and uh I
 
00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm happy to just let you run and
 
00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
have a good conversation without having
 
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
to continuously come back to me asking
 
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up I mean we can do it that
 
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
way but but I think there's the more
 
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
natural speech is good and and I I think
 
00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 align:start position:0%
that'll work but if it doesn't I reserve
 
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
the right to change that and then on
 
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
laptops it was
 
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.129 align:start position:0%
laptops it was
um okay

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
so the technical policy of the speaker
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
is that we're not supposed to have
 
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
laptops up in public sessions now now
 
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
technically every time we have a uh a
 
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
division meeting this is a work meeting
 
00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
this isn't this isn't meant to be a
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
public hearing as much so I think we
 
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
could have a technical exception to
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
where we can have laptops but here's the
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
exception I'm going to offer us and that
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
is the point of not having laptops up is
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
because we ought to be
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
providing a non-verbal communication
 
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
back to the public that we're listening
 
00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
to the testimony and we're paying
 
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
attention but but I also know that we
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
have people like representative erf who
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
are great with the spreadsheets who just
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
keep track of everything so what I'm
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
going to say is go ahead and use your
 
00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
discretion on how you're going to use
 
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
your laptop but keep it in the back of
 
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
your mind that we want to be you know
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
present for the Witnesses in the public
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
is there anything else you want me to
 
00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:31.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman uh in the
 
00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
calendar the thought was it may be nice
 
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
to have all the topics laid out that
 
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.340 align:start position:0%
will be presented along with the times
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
so for example coming up on this Friday
 
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
we'll have strategic I.T plan in
 
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
progress at 2 30 and the like so I would
 
00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:53.099 align:start position:0%
just suggest that moving forward the
 
00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
calendar entry be very specific with
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
regards to the topics and the times so
 
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
this public would know when to come if
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
they were interested in a particular
 
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
topic or not thank you
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
so so so I I I I agree mostly with what
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
you just said I I don't think the times
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
the the after we kick off I don't think
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
the subsequent times for most of our
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
stuff are is it just as important as as
 
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:23.780 align:start position:0%
getting the topics and the sequence
 
00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
what do you think about them Miss Ripple
 
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
uh I I think that might be for the best
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
just because if you schedule exact times
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
as I know they had been doing in some of
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
the other divisions
 
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
um you could end up with a lot of a lot
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
of dead air so to speak if you get done
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
early and have to wait for the next
 
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.329 align:start position:0%
early and have to wait for the next
presentation

00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you are anyone else
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
on the committee you got sort of admin
 
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
notes admin questions rules of the road
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
any anything all right so with that I
 
00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:56.820 align:start position:0%
think we are ready to kick off uh our
 
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:00.420 align:start position:0%

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
salary and and I'll I'll leave it to the

foreign

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
discussion on the mission and
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the department
 
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
that'll be followed by the
 
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
commissioner's 2023 strategy
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
we'll then be going into some of the
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
Staffing level details we'll be talking
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit about contractors and then
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
contract quality management and then
 
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:20.339 align:start position:0%
Department metrics and with that I will
 
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
hand it over to the commissioner we're
 
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
going to adjust the uh this shade so
 
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
that you don't look like you're getting
 
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
a sunburn talking to us and and and for
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
the people in line
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
um to give you more clarity on how you
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
can find these documents if you go into
 
00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339 align:start position:0%
the general court under the house you'll
 
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
see the LBA under the LBA you you can
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
find division three where division three
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
in in in this document that we're
 
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
briefing is there all right well welcome
 
00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:53.339 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning so we put
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
together a deck to be able to walk us
 
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
through I think what uh some of Nathan
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
already covered in hopefully answering
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that the committee
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
may have on the first slide is just an
 
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
overview of the mission and
 
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of our department
 
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
um if if you go to slide four where it
 
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
says uh missionary responsibilities it
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
sort of chunks it out into four general
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
areas and I know a lot of folks are
 
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
familiar with the department but just
 
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
for those that may not be
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
um we kind of Chunk it out into these
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
four categories of Education delivering
 
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.509 align:start position:0%
four categories of Education delivering
Services

00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
delivering Services is typically in the
 
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
form of Case Management Services with
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
the exception of our Direct Care
 
00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:34.019 align:start position:0%
Facilities which are listed as New
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital Gun Club Hampstead
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
and youth services Center protecting the
 
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
health and safety of our citizens and
 
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
providing regulatory oversight so that's
 
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
probably like the most Cliff note
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
version you'll ever get of what does the
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
department do because within this there
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
are multiple things and and you know I
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
was just saying this morning I I've been
 
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
at the department for 25 years very
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
familiar with the business that we do
 
00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:56.579 align:start position:0%
and I'm still learning things
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
um every every time so I mean I know the
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
big stuff but in terms of the little
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
nuances but when we think about our
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
staff we have Direct Care staff
 
00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:07.019 align:start position:0%
non-direct Care staff we have a lot of
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
different areas we have seven divisions
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
and that sort of segues into the the org
 
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
chart slide where you have here this is
 
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.069 align:start position:0%
chart slide where you have here this is
um

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
our attempt at its most simplest version
 
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:22.019 align:start position:0%
of to try to take the department at a
 
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
macro level at least from the office of
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner you'll have the
 
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
commissioner you'll have the deputy
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
which was my prior role you'll see in
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
terms of the operations happening excuse
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
me over to the left but when you go over
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
to the right it chunks out we take our
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
associate Commissioners and then we give
 
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
them portfolios right so the whole idea
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
is that there's integration at this
 
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
higher leadership level so that they
 
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
understand the business of the
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
department but they are also responsible
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
for the day-to-day of these areas so we
 
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
have uh Ann Landry who's over Public
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
Health Services Medicaid and our office
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
of Health Equity Marissa hen is over
 
00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
areas of dcyf Behavioral Health and
 
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital and then Christine
 
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
santinello is economic housing and
 
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
long-term Support Services those are are
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
seven divisions and they're pretty large
 
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
but again seeking for integration and
 
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
then there's there's the other uh
 
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
positions that are below that so we have
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
chief medical officer which is Dr
 
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
Jonathan Ballard which some of you may
 
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.230 align:start position:0%
Jonathan Ballard which some of you may
know

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:20.339 align:start position:0%
um we have our Chief Financial Officer
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh sitting right here right next to me
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
um Chief legal officer uh as well as our
 
00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
we have our
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital CEO currently
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
reports to the commissioner position let
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
me ask you a couple questions I I don't
 
00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:37.019 align:start position:0%
want to interrupt your discussion on the
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
org chart are you done with the org
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
chart I am okay so two questions I the
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
the Deputy Commissioner position is kind
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
of interesting because it's your it's
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
your full-time position but you're an
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
interim now as as the overall
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner and I'm I'm just curious uh
 
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you all have a
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
publicly facing position on on what
 
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to do with the Deputy
 
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
Commissioner position are you are you
 
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
going to look for an interim for that as
 
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
well are you going to try to hire
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
somebody are you reserving it just as a
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
fallback or not a fallback but you know
 
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
what I mean sure at this time we're not
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
going to be filling this position while
 
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
I'm in the role of interim the duties
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
that I had as Deputy have been dispersed
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
amongst the three associate
 
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
Commissioners for the time being and I
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
believe it is the intention at some
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
point to to fill that position so it's
 
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
not that we would be getting rid of it
 
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
it's just that during this time of
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
interim that's how we're managing it
 
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
okay so you're not concerned because
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
you've got delegation that you're not
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
concerned about the lack of leadership
 
00:14:41.329 --> 00:14:41.339 align:start position:0%
in that area while you're doing a bigger
 
00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:42.170 align:start position:0%
in that area while you're doing a bigger
job

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
no I'm not concerned about it we have
 
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
very competent staff okay and then on
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
the other one uh I you know one of my
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
pet rocks is uh privacy and is is that
 
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
is that also a co-equal duty to the
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
chief legal officer or I forget do you
 
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
have a separate privacy officer we have
 
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
a separate privacy offer so if you go
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
over to the left that was one of the
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
areas that I was responsible for
 
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
information systems and that in that
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
Bureau we have a breakdown we have an
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
Epi HIPAA and we have a information
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
security officer but we also work with
 
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
doit for that function as well right and
 
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
so I recall your privacy officer is an
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
attorney and she's been there for like
 
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
five years or so could you just say her
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
name to remind me
 
00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
the privacy officer
 
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
don't I don't want to put you on the
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
spot Kathy Bernhard that's it Kathy
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
bernhard's been there more than five
 
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
years oh okay she's been here a long
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
time all right okay go ahead thank you
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
so are there any other questions on the
 
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
word chart okay
 
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
um so uh representative you mentioned uh
 
00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:49.019 align:start position:0%
road map um that's actually a a a point
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
I want to talk about in these next
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
couple of slides here is in the time
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
that I have as interim commissioner and
 
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
I you know interim who knows how long
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
that's going to be but let's just say
 
00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
it's a year
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
um in that year what are we going to be
 
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
focusing on in the department people ask
 
00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:04.019 align:start position:0%
what's your vision what are you going to
 
00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
be doing it's it's challenging an
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
interim role right I'm not a four-term
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
year commissioner at least not at this
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
point um so I really am a little bit uh
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
Limited in what I can do in terms of
 
00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:16.019 align:start position:0%
strategic planning but I'm not limited
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
in setting goals for the department and
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
asking us to move to those to that end
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
so when I chunk it out which is really
 
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
slide seven but I will go through those
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
with you really looking at it's been
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
it's been a long three years right we
 
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
we've been through a lot in the
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
department and we're tired and there's
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
some internal
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
improvements that can be made with some
 
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:40.259 align:start position:0%
of our systems and I'd like to take the
 
00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
opportunity now to do that and it's a
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
good timing with a budget year as well
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
so if you were to look at the circles
 
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
that you have this is my way of creating
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
a visual to be able to talk to folks
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
about what are we going to be focusing
 
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
on and you'll notice that the big blue
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
bubble is invest in people and culture
 
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
we can't do the work of the department
 
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
without people without our staff and we
 
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
are a 21 vacancy rate right now we're at
 
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
a 21 vacancy rate maybe it's gone down
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
and Nathan's going to tell me like point
 
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
three percent or whatever but it's High
 
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
um you know I think you know I remember
 
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
the department a long time that's the
 
00:17:21.169 --> 00:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
highest I ever remember it being and
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
granted circumstances it's not
 
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
surprising that it's that but the point
 
00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:27.299 align:start position:0%
being is that I intend to build the
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
workforce up over the next 12 months as
 
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
well as getting people to stay right so
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
this isn't about just recruitment it's
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
about retention it's about creating an
 
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
environment where people want to stay
 
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
and want to work our staff are so proud
 
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
of the work that they do and they should
 
00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
be very Mission driven but we can't rely
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
on that alone anymore we have to create
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
an environment where people feel valued
 
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
and that making a difference and I'm not
 
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
saying that we don't have that now but
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to be very intentional and
 
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.549 align:start position:0%
we're going to be very intentional and
strategic

00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
strategic
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
about that in the next 12 months and
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully longer than that if you go
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
over to the left bubble manage resources
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
effectively and efficiently
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
the department you know is we're at a
 
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
point where we really got to focus in
 
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
what are our priorities and the work
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
that we do and we don't we have very
 
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
limited time money and people to do that
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
work so historically the department is
 
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
good at doing a whole bunch of things
 
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
and bringing them inching them along a
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
little bit I really want to get to the
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
finish line and some of the work that we
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
need to do so that's an intentional
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
focus by leadership to every opportunity
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
that we have to make sure checking
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
ourselves that we are on track on goal
 
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
on target to meet that and using the
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
resources in the most efficient way
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
possible so that breaks down I'm
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
simplifying it at a macro level but it
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
breaks down into some pretty specific
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
goals that I'm not going to share with
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
you here right today I am introducing
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
this to our our organization next week
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
and the week after but I wanted to share
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
with you in light of what you're what
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
we're doing here today is that these are
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
this is a focus as well as the bubble
 
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
underneath the enhancing organizational
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
value that's really looking at our our
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
quality our division of quality and
 
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
integrity units so division.unit
 
00:19:12.169 --> 00:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
um Meredith's here to talk a little bit
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
more about that but some of you may or
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
may not know I think it was right before
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
covert there was an executive order to
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
stand up this Division and then take it
 
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
out of just auditor audit and compliance
 
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
functions because that's you know that's
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
part of what we do but part of it was to
 
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
be strategic and proactive with making
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
sure that the dollars that we spend
 
00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
we're getting what we're intending to
 
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
spend them for right that we're working
 
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
with our provider community that we're
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
able to procure for services that are
 
00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:42.299 align:start position:0%
deliverable measurable and and bring
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
results so that's what that whole bubble
 
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
there is about so we talk about contract
 
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
monitoring management of contracts it's
 
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
more than getting the contract across
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
the Finish Line is it making a
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
difference is it working if it's not
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
working why what adjustments need to be
 
00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
made so that's another thing to hold us
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
accountable the bubble on the far right
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
the promote thriving communities
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's really a connection with some of
 
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
the initiatives that we have going on
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
right now about getting the right
 
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
services to the right people at the
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
right time so when we think about things
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
like the behavioral health system we
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
know that there's some more work we can
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
be doing there with mobile crisis and
 
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
accessibility for that when we think
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
about children's system of care we have
 
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
an infrastructure where that has stood
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
up which is great but our providers are
 
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
short staffed so it's hard for them to
 
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
take kids when they don't have the bed
 
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
so so our systems are clogged so working
 
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
in on that Juvenile Justice
 
00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
transformation you know really getting
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
to a re restorative rehabilitative
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
rather than a punitive model so that's
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
what that bubble there speaks to so
 
00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
these are things that our senior
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
leadership on that prior page of the um
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
org chart are going to be responsible
 
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
for moving those commitments forward and
 
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
then working with our division
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
instructors and our staff to make these
 
00:20:59.810 --> 00:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
things happen I've got 12 months which
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
is in a heartbeat will go by very
 
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
quickly so that that is our our Focus
 
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
any any questions on I I have a question
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
a couple questions anyone else from the
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
committee okay so uh under the promote
 
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
thriving communities uh you you offhand
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
were able to to mention a couple of uh
 
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
unmet needs and that you're addressing
 
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
um but if you step back and you think
 
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
okay what is the biggest what are the
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
biggest unmet needs for us to achieve
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
this goal of promoting thriving
 
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
communities is it is it substance abuse
 
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:41.900 align:start position:0%
is it uh just General Wellness is it
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
prenatal care I mean what as you just
 
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
step back what what are your biggest
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
priorities from an unmet needs
 
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.510 align:start position:0%
priorities from an unmet needs
perspective

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
so if I if I may I would I would once I
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
have released all of the detail below
 
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
that then I would be able to share that
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
with you and it's not that I'm keeping
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
it top secret and it's not a simple
 
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
answer it's an awesome response but
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
um Nathan just so kindly pointed out to
 
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
me if you go to the next page uh
 
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
representative you'll see the
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
commitments break down into initiatives
 
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
which break down into goals and
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
deliverables so I'll be able to better
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
answer your question for specifically
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
what goals we have under there I I I
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
think I should just for uh new members
 
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
of the committee and for anyone curious
 
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
we're sort of doing something different
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
this budget cycle than what we've done
 
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
in the past we normally haven't really
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
gotten started on any uh a division or
 
00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
excuse me any Department briefs until
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
after the governor's budget was released
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
and I I just want to thank you for being
 
00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
willing to come in and start to talk us
 
00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
before we're ready to talk numbers and
 
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
so so it's perfectly understandable that
 
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh you know you're not ready for uh the
 
00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
whole detail because this is you're
 
00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
doing us a courtesy because we only have
 
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
so much time before we have to be done
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
with our budget work and we're just
 
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
trying to pre-load some of it so thank
 
00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
you for that
 
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
I I have a question on the culture
 
00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
um how
 
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
are you are you ready or able to
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
describe the extent to which you're kind
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
of satisfied with the current culture
 
00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%
and you're fostering it or or is there
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
is there kind of a sort of a new
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
cultural Paradigm that you really see
 
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
the department needing to move towards
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's more the former I think
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
we're fostering I think we we have a
 
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.430 align:start position:0%
we're fostering I think we we have a
good

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
base of a culture but we could be great
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
we could be doing so much better so
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to build on what we're doing
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
well and go from there so it's uh it's a
 
00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
work in progress but it
 
00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:48.539 align:start position:0%
it's good okay I it's been a rough two
 
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
three years I don't know how you manage
 
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
a culture when everyone's running crazy
 
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
and and you're everything's virtual and
 
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
remote and to you know so so okay I I I
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
get that
 
00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:03.299 align:start position:0%
um all right I I'm I'm ready for page
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
eight if you've not already completed it
 
00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:09.539 align:start position:0%
sure let me I'll just quickly review for
 
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
page eight and we're in the process of
 
00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
rolling this out with our organization
 
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
and we're working on this play with the
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
leadership team so I don't want to get
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
ahead of announcing it to you before my
 
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
staff so that's so we we these are all
 
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
uh are already defined out but we really
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to be able to take um an approach
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to demonstrate what
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
the goal is and what our progress was or
 
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
wasn't towards that so that could better
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
inform where we needed to go after that
 
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
so it's really about accountability and
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
measurement as well we plan to use um
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
you know some of our own tools in terms
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
of smartsheets and dashboards to be able
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
to use at a leadership management level
 
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
but we also intend to engage with our
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
Workforce and our providers as well to
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
let them know where we're at
 
00:24:54.649 --> 00:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just just curious do you do you
 
00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
do you see any I.T infrastructure
 
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
support to help you with sort of uh
 
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
managing I I used to call this
 
00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:06.419 align:start position:0%
management by objectives do you do you
 
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
do you have
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
um it supported assistant that a home
 
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
management effort or is it all ad hoc no
 
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
we certainly do have I.T support we have
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
some really good tools that we'll be
 
00:25:18.409 --> 00:25:18.419 align:start position:0%
using that we use right now and the
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
organization will use them for this okay
 
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.490 align:start position:0%
organization will use them for this okay
super

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
super
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
are there are there questions at this
 
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
point or representative Northern and
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
maybe go a little deeper into the whole
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
um the 21 vacancy rate and
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
how that's affecting you what you're
 
00:25:45.769 --> 00:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
doing about it how you're trying to
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
manage without the 21 and what you
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
envision happening with your new budget
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
sure and we're going to talk a little
 
00:25:57.409 --> 00:25:57.419 align:start position:0%
bit more about that in detail but just
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
to answer answer your question directly
 
00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.789 align:start position:0%
to answer answer your question directly
um

00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:01.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
we're getting by
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
um but but the cost of Getting By is
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
asking staff to do more and more and
 
00:26:09.409 --> 00:26:09.419 align:start position:0%
more to the point of burnout right
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
that's not a culture that we want to
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
have right we want to have a culture
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
where people feel like I was hired to do
 
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
this and this is what I'm doing not a
 
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
million other things but people are
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
helping out all right we are actually
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
looking to move forward with some last
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh well working with the Department of
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
admin services on getting some access to
 
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
some tools that we currently don't have
 
00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:36.059 align:start position:0%
which equates to recruitment activities
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
that we currently don't do because we
 
00:26:39.409 --> 00:26:39.419 align:start position:0%
don't have the tools so we're looking at
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
some new tools and new resources to be
 
00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
able to bring some people in and I'll
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
tell you we've done some of that already
 
00:26:47.529 --> 00:26:47.539 align:start position:0%
and it's worked with particular
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
positions right
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
um it's harder in some of the um
 
00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:54.539 align:start position:0%
we've all heard about the nursing
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
positions right those are the ones that
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
are really hard for sure and it's really
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
really super hard for us to compete with
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
that but even just you know in Nathan's
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
shop alone we're down like 25 Finance
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
people well being down 25 Finance people
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
means that bills don't maybe get paid on
 
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
time right so we're looking at systems
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
and efficiencies of ways to address that
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
but we really need
 
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
the ability to fill those positions so
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
even I there's a concern where positions
 
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
are vacant well we're working really
 
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
hard to fill them but sometimes we feel
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
them and then people leave right so the
 
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
net gain is hard getting harder to get
 
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:33.049 align:start position:0%
net gain is hard getting harder to get
at

00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.059 --> 00:27:36.890 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
are you finding yourself
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
um using a lot of overtime with
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
employees is that increased in
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
particular areas yes
 
00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
and one other question are employees are
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
there any employees that are sort of
 
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.289 align:start position:0%
there any employees that are sort of
cross-trained

00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:54.299 align:start position:0%
cross-trained
 
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
so that one division
 
00:27:59.570 --> 00:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
isn't down as many people as another
 
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
division is down to where they're
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
crippled can't do you have some people
 
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
who are cross-trained so they can go
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
back and forth yes absolutely what you
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
know it's this is the this is the beauty
 
00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
of our staff is that we have people that
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
are willing to step up and help out so
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know we have unwind happening you
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
know we have to ask people to step up
 
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
that maybe they were they they were an
 
00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
eligibility worker prior and they're
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
doing something now and they can come in
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
and help lift the load up a little bit
 
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
we're doing that everywhere we can and
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.490 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
um other than
 
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
the burnout for Workforce which I think
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
we can all understand where that's
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
coming from are you hearing anything
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
else about the the culture the work
 
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
culture that you're gonna try to Foster
 
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
to help retain people are they what else
 
00:28:51.289 --> 00:28:51.299 align:start position:0%
are the factors if anything or is
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
burnout it
 
00:28:54.649 --> 00:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
you know I think the flexibility this
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
High the hybrid the remote uh work the
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
telework policy that the state has now
 
00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:00.539 align:start position:0%
is definitely been a great recruitment
 
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
tool people like to have flexibility we
 
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
need to trust our staff that they can do
 
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
their work and I think the department
 
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
has been a leader in telework even
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
before the policy came out we were doing
 
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
it I had done a department-wide policy
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
so I think people want to feel valued
 
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
and they want to know that what they do
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
makes a difference but they want support
 
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
from their supervisor when they want to
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
work environment that doesn't burn them
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
out we've heard repeatedly that people
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
say and and we know we look at
 
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
productivity what I I go I talk to
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
supervisors and I say how do you know
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
what's working how do you know your
 
00:29:30.889 --> 00:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
staff how does it working with staff is
 
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
they're getting the work's getting done
 
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
you know and it's getting done well it's
 
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
quality work so we do have touch points
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
and check in on that but I think work
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
environment like that makes a difference
 
00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
too so it doesn't just pay you know it's
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
like you you come to work and you feel
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
like you want to come to work because
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
you're making a difference I don't have
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
to answer your question
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299 align:start position:0%
retirements of people who might barely
 
00:30:06.049 --> 00:30:06.059 align:start position:0%
be eligible to retire but they're just
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
leaving because of the stress and the
 
00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate is that happening to you
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
too I think in the very beginning we saw
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of that happen um but it's kind of
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
it's kind of leveled out a little bit we
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
always have the projected number of
 
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
people that could actually retire and it
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
never comes to a full hundred percent of
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
that that's good yeah thank you
 
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you Mr
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
chairman I apologize for the sun I
 
00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
attempted to help you out but it seems
 
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
to be coming from above I couldn't get
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
her to scale the wall to take care of
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
that one
 
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
as for the 21
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
on page uh well your org chart here is
 
00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
there a way to maybe summarize how that
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
21 percent would be spread across this
 
00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
particular org chart of bureaus and
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
divisions for example five percent in
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
the dcyf or uh 10 in the division of
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health something along that
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
example we do have uh slides further in
 
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
the deck that break that down
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
specifically if that works that's
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
Nathan's section
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
uh representable thank you chairman
 
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
um regarding page eight and the
 
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
initiatives and goals that you're going
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
to be bringing up with your staff are
 
00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:24.539 align:start position:0%
those slides going to come back to us at
 
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
some point in a future presentation sure
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
yep they'll be posted probably on our
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
website too so yes it'll be public
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
documents to share can follow up can we
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
then just tie that to the same page
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
somehow where this document is so people
 
00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
can make the tie
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
um sure right
 
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
I I I would look to Kevin for that one
 
00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:48.539 align:start position:0%
yeah sure anything that comes through
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
the division this session that's budget
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
related will post to the division three
 
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
um so the to the 21 vacancy rate I just
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
to make you feel a little bit better by
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
commiserating Rockingham County uh the
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
nursing home is like a 45 vacancy rate
 
00:32:11.769 --> 00:32:11.779 align:start position:0%
so you're doing great
 
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
but so perspective so uh you can
 
00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:17.870 align:start position:0%
but so perspective so uh you can
continue

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
and so if there's no other questions on
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
our sort of our vision our focus at the
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
next part I think is a natural segue is
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative Moody was asking about
 
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
some of the Staffing breakdown if it's
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
on um page nine what we've done here is
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
we have put together a history at the
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
agency level of Staffing positions
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
um I I just want to thank my team for
 
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
for manually putting this together
 
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
there's quite a bit of work and
 
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
Reconciliation that goes into something
 
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
um but what you'll what you'll see is
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
back in 2013
 
00:32:59.810 --> 00:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
um there were a total of 20 roughly 2
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
900 full-time authorized positions
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
um we didn't go back further we looked
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
further but I honestly couldn't fit it
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
onto a page and still have it be
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
um readable but if if you go all the way
 
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
back to 2004 the department actually had
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
36 uh 3 605 positions at that point in
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
time just if you're looking at it uh
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
from a 20-year perspective you'll
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
probably notice uh within division for
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
children youth and families in the 2020
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
2021 time period you'll see a large
 
00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
increase in positions there at that
 
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
point in time the legislature
 
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
appropriated uh funds and established
 
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
positions to address the child
 
00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:39.419 align:start position:0%
protection system at that point in time
 
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
to try to get the case loads down I
 
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
believe we had 128 cpsws created at that
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:48.419 align:start position:0%
um if you look down towards New
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital also in the 2021 to
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
2022 time frame
 
00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:54.419 align:start position:0%
uh you'll see an increase in the number
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire hospital positions at
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
that point in time uh there were
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
positions that were converted from uh at
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
that point they were temporary full-time
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
positions they were converted to
 
00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:08.339 align:start position:0%
full-time positions uh through through
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
that particular process
 
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
the subsequent page is essentially a
 
00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.419 align:start position:0%
more detailed version at the activity
 
00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:22.379 align:start position:0%
level of the positions and you'll see a
 
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
little bit more movement here and and
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
some of this is is lateral so if you if
 
00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
you scroll down to the the ocom section
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
um if you look at activity 9 500 you'll
 
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
see in 2019 to 2020 there's a you know a
 
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339 align:start position:0%
roughly a 54 position increase there but
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
what that actually actually represents
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
is that's the point in time in which the
 
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
financing functions were formally
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
centralized so what may appear to be a
 
00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
large increase is actually just a
 
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
lateral movement of positions
 
00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
um yes so the rule of thumb whenever
 
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
somebody uses an acronym the first time
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
I liked it to be set of course and we
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
got new people here so ocom if I
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
remember Office of the commissioner this
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
is sort of the central overhead of the
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
department yes that that is correct and
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
I I am also um an individual that does
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
not enjoy many acronyms I always kick
 
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
them back in the GNC letters when I see
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
them so I will do my best all right to
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
not do that going forward
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
where was I
 
00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.550 align:start position:0%
where was I
um

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
right so also in the office of the
 
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner in during that during that
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
time frame in the in the 20 in the
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
2019-2020 period you will see a large
 
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
increase in 95-20
 
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
um that that is legal that's legal and
 
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
Regulatory services and that's a that
 
00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
was at a point in time when we
 
00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:53.339 align:start position:0%
centralize our child support attorneys
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
under the central legal services so that
 
00:35:58.849 --> 00:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
they they were all within the same team
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
um and then if you look at 9540 where
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
you see a large you know a decrease of
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
of over 50 some odd positions that was
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
actually where we moved positions out of
 
00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:11.099 align:start position:0%
the office of Information Services into
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
other areas across the department
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
um there there are stories in histories
 
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
behind each one of those moves
 
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
um if if there are questions you know
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
like in looking at this following up if
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
you have specific questions
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
um each one of these will probably take
 
00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
a little bit of research to get an
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
answer to but I'm more than willing to
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
do that if the committee requests that
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative hole
 
00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
um is it possible to get these activity
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
codes with something other than numbers
 
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
kind of a general overview of what right
 
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
9 400 9500 is and share that with the
 
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
committee sure so our and and if if it's
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
okay with the committee so our plan um
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
we will be providing a budget briefing
 
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
book and and the budget briefing book it
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
it includes the accounts that are over a
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars and um all in all it's
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
probably close to 200 pages but within
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
the budget briefing book we have the
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
activity we have the accounts we have
 
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
what are what are the RSA what are the
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
populations that are being served what
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
does the service delivery look like is
 
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
it a direct service is it a contracted
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
service will also be incorporating into
 
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
that into that document some of the key
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
performance metrics that that were
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
either um that were incorporating from
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
the agency budget request as well as
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
some of the expected outcomes for each
 
00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:35.579 align:start position:0%
program and area so I believe that that
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
document will probably give you more
 
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
than more information than you may want
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
to know but I I believe it should
 
00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
address all of those questions and and
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
my My Hope and intention was that the
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee um that we could work from
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
that document to help have informed
 
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
discussions about what are the major
 
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
areas you know so we're you know we're
 
00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
spending time on the 7100 accounts that
 
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
are you know 300 million dollars instead
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
of the fifty thousand dollar account we
 
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
may have for some smaller Grant just to
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
try to just to try to
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
um make the best use of the committee's
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
time if if that's appropriate uh that
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
sounds good other questions I have one
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
um on
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
the 9540 line where you're saying we
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
moved people out of it
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
um before before my time on finance
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh the kind of the story I had heard was
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
that there was a budget cycle where it
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
was really de-prioritized uh and that uh
 
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
it and I'm just wondering if if um a
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
couple things is this is this what we're
 
00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
seeing going from 2019 to 2020 where the
 
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:50.780 align:start position:0%
budget process
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
de-emphasized I.T and and
 
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.730 align:start position:0%
de-emphasized I.T and and
um

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:59.410 --> 00:38:59.420 align:start position:0%
and also I'm just curious if we have any
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
lingering negative consequences of
 
00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.950 align:start position:0%
lingering negative consequences of
having

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
um maybe let go a bunch of I.T positions
 
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
so we didn't let go of any I.T positions
 
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
I was part of the change of this it was
 
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
it was during the budget but it was
 
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
really driven it was under the time of
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner Myers in terms of looking
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
at how we had structured our our is our
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
I.T services so it in it in the
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
department it has toggled back and forth
 
00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
between being a centralized function and
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
then being a function that uh puts it
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
back out into the program area so during
 
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
that 19 to 20 time we kept in the ocom
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
level if you will uh there was
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
leadership but then we took all of the
 
00:39:41.569 --> 00:39:41.579 align:start position:0%
I.T folks and put them sitting side by
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
side with program so that was really
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
just sort of a going back to what it was
 
00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
and they stay connected with the
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
leadership in ocom so for strategy
 
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
perspective but for the day-to-day so we
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
didn't lose anybody
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
turn to slide uh 11.
 
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
um so so the the 21 that we're
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
referencing earlier that that's that's
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
actually from from a November
 
00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:13.619 align:start position:0%
um presentation that we had provided the
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
most recent figure is before you and it
 
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
is it is 20 20.4 as of December
 
00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:21.650 align:start position:0%
is it is 20 20.4 as of December
um

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
the the slide in in front of you this
 
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
shows uh a global history of the the
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
authorized positions full-time
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
authorized positions and what we've seen
 
00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
for vacancy rates and so in 2019 you'll
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
you will see a 12.4 vacancy rate
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
um average across the department
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
now there were a number of events that
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sure everybody in this room are
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
aware of uh in in March of 2020 covid
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
struck in April of 2020 uh all agencies
 
00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:53.099 align:start position:0%
were put under a hiring freeze until
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
December of that year
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
um the the HHS also had a couple of of
 
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
unique factors that we were navigating
 
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
um in the 2020-2021 biennium we had a 30
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
million dollar back of the budget cut
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
um in this current biennium um we have
 
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
had a 22.6 million personnel only uh
 
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
back of the budget cut
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and and we had spoken earlier
 
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh just about the
 
00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
the 3 000 person cap and how that has
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
impacted the department
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
and the cap itself doesn't really do
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
much from from a from a functions
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
perspective the the thing that really
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
has the impact is the 22.6 million
 
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
dollar Personnel cut so so what that
 
00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:41.339 align:start position:0%
meant um I I started my role this past
 
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
spring uh so about nine months ago now
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the first things that I did
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
was I said okay division directors each
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
area you need to hold x million dollars
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh vacant of positions and so
 
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
um as was referenced I Believe In the
 
00:41:59.329 --> 00:41:59.339 align:start position:0%
orientation session uh the the week
 
00:41:59.339 --> 00:42:00.589 align:start position:0%
orientation session uh the the week
prior

00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
prior
 
00:42:04.329 --> 00:42:04.339 align:start position:0%
um many of dhhs's positions are not 100
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
generally funded so they're oftentimes a
 
00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
mix it may be 50 50 maybe 60 40 maybe a
 
00:42:10.619 --> 00:42:11.569 align:start position:0%
mix it may be 50 50 maybe 60 40 maybe a
variety

00:42:11.569 --> 00:42:11.579 align:start position:0%
variety
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
um and any number in between there and
 
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
so in order to get to that 22.6 million
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
dollars we can't it's it's not a
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
one-to-one we can't take one position
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
and there's a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
we take one position and we get forty
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so the um the the
 
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
Personnel reduction I think has really
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
been the the challenging piece because
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
then we don't even have an opportunity
 
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
to post that position
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
um because you know we'll post a
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
position and we may need to repost it
 
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
and as everybody knows the labor market
 
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:43.140 align:start position:0%
right now is is certainly a challenging
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
one because everybody's asking the
 
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
question where did the labor force go
 
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
um if anybody has the answer let me know
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
um and and that is that that continues
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
to kind of be a challenge and and that's
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
one of the you know that's one of the
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
contributing factors to this sort of
 
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
exponential growth that you have seen of
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
course as has already been noted
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
um 2020 2021 2022 uh presented some
 
00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:11.339 align:start position:0%
unprecedented challenges for the
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
department and and perhaps I'd also like
 
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
to point out that the department doesn't
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
work alone and I'll be talking a little
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
bit about this later we also rely on our
 
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
on our community providers and our
 
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
contractors in the community and they
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
face the same challenges that we did it
 
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
which only compounded
 
00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:27.589 align:start position:0%
which only compounded
um

00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
many of the the resource limitations
 
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:32.579 align:start position:0%
that we did have at that point
 
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
the the subsequent slide on page 12
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
um there was a request for for a
 
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
breakdown of of a part-time
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
um temporary positions and full-time
 
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
temporary positions and this slide here
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
this this shows you the the temporary
 
00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
the part-time average of the part-time
 
00:43:55.609 --> 00:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
temporary positions the department
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
um we we do utilize these in order to
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
flex so to speak so when we have a
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
particular need in a particular area we
 
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
try to bring in part-time employees in
 
00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:07.859 align:start position:0%
lieu of overtime
 
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
um to avoid some of those some of those
 
00:44:11.089 --> 00:44:11.099 align:start position:0%
cultural issues you know whether it be
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
burnout or otherwise so we do use these
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
as you see
 
00:44:17.089 --> 00:44:17.099 align:start position:0%
um more than half of those are currently
 
00:44:17.099 --> 00:44:18.530 align:start position:0%
um more than half of those are currently
vacant

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
vacant
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
um and and that that's that's kind of a
 
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
baseline Trend that you see across those
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
five years the the next slide on pay on
 
00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:29.780 align:start position:0%
page 13 this is the average full-time
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
temporary employees
 
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to point out
 
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
that currently in the state fiscal year
 
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.809 align:start position:0%
that currently in the state fiscal year
23

00:44:37.809 --> 00:44:37.819 align:start position:0%
23
 
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
101 of those employees are at public
 
00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
health and a lot of that does have to do
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
with the ELC and arpa funds and other
 
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
funds that what's that oh I I apologize
 
00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:51.470 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:45:04.069 align:start position:0%
the um
[Music]

00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.609 --> 00:45:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.619 --> 00:45:09.109 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:10.370 align:start position:0%
now
um

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
where was I
 
00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
yes I was on an acronym again I
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
apologize all right just just throw the
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
gavel at me next time I do that
 
00:45:22.849 --> 00:45:22.859 align:start position:0%
oh that works too
 
00:45:22.859 --> 00:45:23.690 align:start position:0%
oh that works too
um

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
so we do have 101 part-time Temporaries
 
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
employees at Public Health right now
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
included in that number as well are the
 
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry full-time included in that
 
00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
number as well are the the new positions
 
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
at Hampstead Hospital
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
um Hampstead Hospital as as you all know
 
00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
uh was was acquired by the state this
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
past June I believe it's the first time
 
00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
the state has ever required a hospital
 
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
so those positions did not end up being
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
as full-time authorized positions at
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
this point in time that would be the
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
Department's intent through this budget
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
to have those converted to full-time
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
authorized positions but those are also
 
00:46:05.089 --> 00:46:05.099 align:start position:0%
showing up in those figures there
 
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
on page 14
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
um these are the unclassified positions
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Health and Human
 
00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:14.690 align:start position:0%
Services and
 
00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:15.050 align:start position:0%
Services and
[Music]

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.069 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
you will see a slight increase in 2023
 
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
and the total number
 
00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
um that represents the six unclassified
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
positions that were created at Hampstead
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
Hospital those represent the executive
 
00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
team yes representative Edwards uh okay
 
00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
I I I'm going to ask you occasionally to
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
do a little bit of a tangent because
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
half half of the committee is new and I
 
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
don't know what they know and what they
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
don't know and then I have a really bad
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
memory so so earlier you mentioned back
 
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
of the budget cuts I think that's an
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
important concept we could come back and
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
maybe you could teach us what that means
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
how that that works of course I don't
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
think everyone knows and then you you
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
know just in this the reason I I stopped
 
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
you here was just to help people
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
understand the distinction between
 
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
unclassified and classifieds because
 
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
these could be new terminologies
 
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.510 align:start position:0%
these could be new terminologies
absolutely

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.809 align:start position:0%
absolutely
um so

00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.329 --> 00:47:17.339 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to I'm more than happy to
 
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
all right so classified employees
 
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
um are are primarily are primarily
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Personnel system so the
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
division of personnel
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
um they have Personnel rules classified
 
00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.589 align:start position:0%
um they have Personnel rules classified
employees

00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:36.260 align:start position:0%
um uh may be represented by the union
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
the unclassified employees are
 
00:47:43.329 --> 00:47:43.339 align:start position:0%
established under RSA 941a
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
the classified employees are under a
 
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
separate pay scale which you can find on
 
00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
services website and
 
00:47:52.859 --> 00:47:53.630 align:start position:0%
services website and
um

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
versus the unclassified employees which
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
you will find in RSA 941a there is a
 
00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
schedule there the unclassified
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
positions for most agencies are
 
00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
established in their respective RSA uh
 
00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:09.140 align:start position:0%
the the department
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
dhhs's employees will you will also find
 
00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
those in the RSA there there are some
 
00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:17.220 align:start position:0%
some slight differences between them
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
though but unclassified employees uh
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
they they do not receive overtime
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
um they often myself I I am an
 
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
unclassified employee so I will work
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
until things get done versus classified
 
00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.890 align:start position:0%
until things get done versus classified
employees

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
um who who you know would receive
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
overtime or comp time if if they worked
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
outside of their standard 37.5 or 40
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
Hour Week depending on the position does
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
it also work to think of it as just
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
um salaried versus hourly I think that's
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
okay so if there are no questions I
 
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
think representative Holt has a question
 
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
and then representative Stringham
 
00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
so sorry I'm coming at this from the
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
corporate world a little bit am I to
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
read this chart on page 14 that there
 
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
are effectively 93
 
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
positions within the HHS completely 10
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
of which are currently unfilled
 
00:49:20.809 --> 00:49:20.819 align:start position:0%
that our salaried and the balance of the
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
workers of the 2900 are all hour hourly
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
these things yes yes so the 83 of the
 
00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
positions are are currently filled are
 
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
in the process of being filled and then
 
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
the the head not answered it which is
 
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
the balance of the the 2800 remaining
 
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
positions are all hourly yes correct uh
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative stream
 
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
um this is kind of uh flipping your
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
point about cutting a position and then
 
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
essentially losing Grant support
 
00:49:58.970 --> 00:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
um in terms of any census uh driven
 
00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.470 align:start position:0%
um in terms of any census uh driven
grants

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
grants
 
00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.790 align:start position:0%
grants
um

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
um either due to failure to provide
 
00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
services that um
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
for for services and for people that are
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
identified or an inability to census
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
them uh because we're short staffed do
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
you see see the current shortfall is
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
limiting us and uh essentially reducing
 
00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
our access to say federal grants does
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
that make any
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
so so the
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
so so what you're saying is if if we
 
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
have vacant positions
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
um are we are we unable to leverage all
 
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
federal funds available to us
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
uh that that's that's part of it okay
 
00:50:44.569 --> 00:50:44.579 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:50:44.579 --> 00:50:45.770 align:start position:0%
so the
I

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
so if we if we don't have positions
 
00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.530 align:start position:0%
so if we if we don't have positions
filled

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
filled
 
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
um there are a variety of things that
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
could happen and I'm partially going to
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
be answering representative norgren's
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
question as well here from earlier if if
 
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
we have vacant positions
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
and you know we are not able to whether
 
00:51:08.569 --> 00:51:08.579 align:start position:0%
it's respond or write to no requests or
 
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
respond to to court orders or
 
00:51:15.049 --> 00:51:15.059 align:start position:0%
um be be timely with requests of the
 
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
legislature or whatever it may be you
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
know those those are not necessary those
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily have any media
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
dollar impact however if we do receive
 
00:51:26.569 --> 00:51:26.579 align:start position:0%
grants or Appropriations through the
 
00:51:28.609 --> 00:51:28.619 align:start position:0%
legislature in general funds or whatever
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
other funding source
 
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
um there is a process that we often have
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
to go through in order to get those
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
funds out the door
 
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
um all of our funds above ten thousand
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
dollars if they're not sole source they
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
have to go through an objective uh
 
00:51:45.049 --> 00:51:45.059 align:start position:0%
procurement process which is timely and
 
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
intensive every award has to be awarded
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
um based on objective criteria published
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
and known to all parties uh part of its
 
00:51:54.049 --> 00:51:54.059 align:start position:0%
establishment or RSA 21i and part of
 
00:51:58.609 --> 00:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
it's under uh RSA 21g36 and 37.
 
00:51:58.619 --> 00:51:59.450 align:start position:0%
it's under uh RSA 21g36 and 37.
um

00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:01.609 --> 00:52:01.619 align:start position:0%
and then and then all those would need
 
00:52:04.609 --> 00:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
to subsequently be approved by GNC so if
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
if we do not have Staffing available to
 
00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
conduct the planning to prepare the RFP
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
to conduct the evaluation and then
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
manage the subsequent contract those
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
Grant funds or those General funds or
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
whatever funds they may be may not
 
00:52:21.049 --> 00:52:21.059 align:start position:0%
actually be spent
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
um am I
 
00:52:24.049 --> 00:52:24.059 align:start position:0%
getting to your
 
00:52:27.309 --> 00:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
yeah that's one one example okay yes
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
but are you also asking if the work
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't get done like what's the impact
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
of the work not getting done well I'm
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
sure it doesn't support your mission
 
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
very well but I was also interested in
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
the financial side yeah
 
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.770 align:start position:0%
the financial side yeah
foreign

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:41.780 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
I think we have a lot of overtime in
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
some of those cases as well thank you
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
so so are there other questions at this
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
point okay when you think it's a a good
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
break to go back
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
um we did two back of the budget cuts I
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
think in uh the last budget we did one
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
on Manpower head count of limiting uh
 
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
you to three thousand
 
00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:09.349 align:start position:0%
you to three thousand
full-time

00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
classified positions do they say that
 
00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:14.339 align:start position:0%
right yes yes uh or unclassified
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
positions classified okay and we also
 
00:53:20.809 --> 00:53:20.819 align:start position:0%
did a dollar back of a budget and so be
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
again because we have four new people on
 
00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
finance what is it back of the uh budget
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
cut and and what and what impact do you
 
00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
think that had sure absolutely so
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
um when when House Bill won the
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
operating budget and House Bill 2
 
00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:41.099 align:start position:0%
um the trailer Bill are passed there is
 
00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
a surplus statement that accompanies
 
00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
those bills and it it effectively shows
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
here's our expenditures here's our
 
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
revenue for House Bill one
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
simplistically put for House Bill 2
 
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
there may be a variety of Appropriations
 
00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
or assumptions within that and so it may
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
be a six million dollar appropriation
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
for this purpose it may be a you know
 
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
we're going to assume we're going to
 
00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
increase our Revenue by one million
 
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
dollars at dra if we hire new
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
collections officers and there's a
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
listing there there's a series of pages
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
that tie into that and and then that
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
comes up with a total
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
um what what is also included in there
 
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
is if there is a back of the budget cut
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
so let's say the department you're given
 
00:54:23.809 --> 00:54:23.819 align:start position:0%
a three billion dollar budget
 
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559 align:start position:0%
however you are now required to return
 
00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:31.140 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars of General funds and
 
00:54:34.849 --> 00:54:34.859 align:start position:0%
how we do that during the biennium is we
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
either hold positions vacant in order to
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
hit that to to address those General
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
funds uh certain contracts may not go
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
forward certain initiatives that or
 
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
funded may not go forward some of which
 
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
may make her naturally just due to
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
limitations of resources some of which
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
may occur intentionally and so the broad
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
back of the budget cut that that could
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
be addressed through contract lapses or
 
00:55:04.609 --> 00:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
or position lapses and whatnot
 
00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
versus the current biennium has a 22.6
 
00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:11.579 align:start position:0%
million dollar Personnel back of the
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
budget cut and that must be satisfied
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
exclusively you know with with the class
 
00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
10 or Class 12 or class 50 or class 59
 
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
um Personnel lines
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
and how that has really played out in
 
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
practice is is we
 
00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:32.099 align:start position:0%
from a hiring perspective
 
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
if we have
 
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
um you know say we have 10 positions in
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
a particular area and five of those are
 
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
filled and we're only able to post three
 
00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:42.180 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to be posting the
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
other two that I mean it's essentially
 
00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
what that means is we will never have an
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fill those other two
 
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
positions the other three positions
 
00:55:53.569 --> 00:55:53.579 align:start position:0%
given the current labor market we may be
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
able to hire somebody within a month we
 
00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
may be able to be able to hire somebody
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
within seven months and then we bring
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
them in and then uh to the
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner's Point earlier if if you
 
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
bring somebody in but then you lose them
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
I mean that that is a critical function
 
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
long story short those two positions
 
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
that we can never post will will
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
continue to remain vacant and those
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
three that we can post we will never
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
have a hundred percent
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
um vacancy rate necessary well and I'm
 
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
thinking globally here take three and
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
move to 3 000.
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
um we will never we will never have a
 
00:56:27.049 --> 00:56:27.059 align:start position:0%
hundred percent so because of that
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
because the dollars really Drive what
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
we're able to actually hire the three
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar cap I mean it could be
 
00:56:35.569 --> 00:56:35.579 align:start position:0%
thirty one hundred
 
00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm yes three three thousand
 
00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:40.130 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm yes three three thousand
first

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:40.140 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
there we go the 3 000 person cap really
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't I I mean it's it is it of course
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
a requirement which we have adhered to
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
but but it's it's the dollars that are
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
really driving what is what is possible
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh from a hiring perspective and so
 
00:56:59.450 --> 00:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
that's you know that that's why um as of
 
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
December we we didn't quite have 2600
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
employees and we were still 400 people
 
00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
off one of the many reasons but one of
 
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we were still 400
 
00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
employees off of that cap
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
I think thank you for that um
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative Holt
 
00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
so going to your analogy using 10 people
 
00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
right five positions filled sure five
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
open right you can post three
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
so I didn't read through hb1 and hb2
 
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
last year I was not a House member but
 
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
why would it not be possible to post
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
the three positions that you're talking
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
about posting plus the other two and
 
00:57:41.329 --> 00:57:41.339 align:start position:0%
then as soon as you have the three
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
filled right then put the freeze in
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
place so you have five openings you're
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
trying to look for people and as you
 
00:57:50.809 --> 00:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
ramp up toward that you get the first
 
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
position filled you get the second
 
00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
position filled why not
 
00:57:56.809 --> 00:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
then start looking at closing those
 
00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
positions or putting a hold on them
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
instead of putting hold out outright so
 
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:04.140 align:start position:0%
it's for certain positions we we
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
actually conduct Mass postings where
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
where we post more of the the the the
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
the position in general you know where
 
00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
we have 30 positions
 
00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
um and and we do exactly that for those
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
types of scenarios for other scenarios
 
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
where you know there's there's a
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
business systems analyst and there's a
 
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
program specialist and there's another
 
00:58:26.569 --> 00:58:26.579 align:start position:0%
position in order to manage
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
um in order to manage the back of the
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
budget cut we've had to unfund those
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
positions and so
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
um there's a little bit of behind the
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
scenes work where we we don't we we
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
can't post those positions that don't
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
have dollars tied to them because in the
 
00:58:42.289 --> 00:58:42.299 align:start position:0%
system there's just some challenges so
 
00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
we we try to address it the best that we
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
can but there are some system
 
00:58:45.599 --> 00:58:47.510 align:start position:0%
can but there are some system
limitations

00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
um that that we just have to manage on
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
an ongoing basis
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's a great question though
 
00:58:56.089 --> 00:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you for that uh I
 
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
don't see any other questions we we left
 
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
where you were about to plunge into 15.
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
okay uh let me let me do a time check
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
we're about an hour into this when you
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
were thinking about this presentation
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
how long did you think it was going to
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
take us to get to this point 20 minutes
 
00:59:17.089 --> 00:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
something like that something like that
 
00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's shaking her head
 
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
longer or shorter
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
we're hoping for the whole thing would
 
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
be about it yeah we were aiming for
 
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
about an hour hour and a half yeah oh
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right very good
 
00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
the the next
 
00:59:31.079 --> 00:59:32.030 align:start position:0%
the the next
um

00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
if you turn to slide 15
 
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
um and slide 16. so a few years ago the
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
department had an external consulting
 
00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
firm conduct an analysis of the
 
00:59:46.609 --> 00:59:46.619 align:start position:0%
Department's overall operations I I
 
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
pulled a couple of Snippets
 
00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:50.579 align:start position:0%
um just and and the full report is
 
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
online I can certainly provide the link
 
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
to that I Source it at the bottom
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
um I pulled a couple of Snippets from
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
that report where they were looking at
 
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
the total number of positions at the
 
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
department compared to states of a
 
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:05.700 align:start position:0%
similar size
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
um just to kind of because there were a
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
couple of questions around whether HHS
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
is is lean or is it bloated from a
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
position perspective and we were talking
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
earlier just about how the department is
 
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
about 45 of the entire state budget
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
um but but we represent about 3 200 of
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
the 11
 
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
000 employees uh in in the current
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
agency budget
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
um which I believe is a little less than
 
01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
29 right around 29 and and so what you
 
01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:38.579 align:start position:0%
would you see on slide 15 this is the
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
entire department compared to other
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
states and and the the graph on the left
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
is the is the per 100 000 retina the per
 
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
capita comparison
 
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
um the report also includes a more
 
01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:52.910 align:start position:0%
um the report also includes a more
specific

01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
um analysis of Public Health departments
 
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh from across the country now I I think
 
01:00:59.690 --> 01:00:59.700 align:start position:0%
it's also just important to recognize
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
that every state has a different model
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
so some may rely more on subcontractors
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
or contractors and I think that's just
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
important to recognize when looking at
 
01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.870 align:start position:0%
important to recognize when looking at
this

01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:01:13.849 --> 01:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
um one kind of thing that just stands
 
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
out to me and perhaps I'm biased is the
 
01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
um the public health spend per staffer
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
which is 438 000 for New Hampshire Which
 
01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
is higher than some of the other
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
comparisons that they had included in
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
that but but that that report is
 
01:01:29.809 --> 01:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
available online if if anyone is is
 
01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:30.950 align:start position:0%
available online if if anyone is is
curious

01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
curious
 
01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:32.339 align:start position:0%
um or would like to investigate that
 
01:01:32.339 --> 01:01:33.589 align:start position:0%
um or would like to investigate that
further

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:01:36.289 --> 01:01:36.299 align:start position:0%
so I'll come to you in just a second so
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
so this is a measure of potential
 
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
efficiency so if we're talking about uh
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
quality or Effectiveness do we have any
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
sort of Benchmark to to be coupled with
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
this like do we know we're doing at
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
least as well as Vermont for example
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
and we we can't really tell that right
 
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
well I I think you'd have to look at it
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
at a program specific level so if you
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
were going to look at like Medicaid or
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
something along those lines you know
 
01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
there may be and I think that would be a
 
01:02:08.819 --> 01:02:09.950 align:start position:0%
there may be and I think that would be a
further

01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
further extensive analysis to really get
 
01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
to that question about how to do that
 
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
comparison I don't believe there was any
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
similar type comparison as far as
 
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
program outcomes
 
01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
um in that report though
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Hull thank you
 
01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:27.299 align:start position:0%
so it's not clear to me whether these
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
other states have such a high dependency
 
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
on county level operations right I'm
 
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
assuming the county level nursing homes
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
and any other things that are happening
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
within the counties and or even the
 
01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
major cities are not rolling up to the
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
state level in this graph where Vermont
 
01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
might count their personnel differently
 
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
for instance do you know
 
01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
right being in this being in this field
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
for a while do you know whether Vermont
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
for instance or mean
 
01:02:55.849 --> 01:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
um does their roll up differently in
 
01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
terms of total Personnel I I'm not aware
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
of how the the county systems and the
 
01:03:02.569 --> 01:03:02.579 align:start position:0%
other states included here operate but
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
but to representative Edwards point this
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
is one indicator and there's many that
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
on slide 17
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
um it looked like commissioner wanted to
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
say something and then we have
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives verified
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
I was just going to respond in terms of
 
01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
the county question I know that Vermont
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Maine and Rhode Island
 
01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't are we're very similar in how we
 
01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.650 align:start position:0%
don't are we're very similar in how we
doesn't

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
um with the county structure and how we
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
do our state funding I can't speak to
 
01:03:36.049 --> 01:03:36.059 align:start position:0%
Wyoming and Montana but I believe it's
 
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
the same I think we were trying to look
 
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
at governments that operated similar to
 
01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative could you
 
01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
explain how the graph on the right ties
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
to the left it goes from zero to 80 and
 
01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
the numbers are you don't even don't
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
don't correlate
 
01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
are you on um page 16
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
yes so so that that's the the staff per
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
100 000 residents
 
01:04:04.079 --> 01:04:05.450 align:start position:0%
100 000 residents
yes

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
of course
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
slide 17
 
01:04:09.599 --> 01:04:10.370 align:start position:0%
slide 17
um

01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
one thing that I think is important just
 
01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
before we start to get into the actual
 
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
budget here in the coming weeks
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
um you will see contract lines in our
 
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
budget um some of which are large
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
I like to think about the contracts that
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
we have with our providers in two
 
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
distinct ways I like to think about the
 
01:04:29.569 --> 01:04:29.579 align:start position:0%
contractors that provide Direct Services
 
01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
to the Department
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
versus the the contractors that provide
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
services on behalf of the department to
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the State of New
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a we have a little
 
01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
over 200 contractors that are providing
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
Services I've listed some examples here
 
01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:46.140 align:start position:0%
given the time I won't go through each
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:51.299 align:start position:0%
on page 18 you will see examples of the
 
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
contractors that deliver services to New
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens on behalf of the
 
01:04:58.370 --> 01:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
department there are more of those
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
there's there's over 400 the department
 
01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:03.059 align:start position:0%
at any point in time may have 800 to
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
1000 active agreements
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
um there are a variety of different
 
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
agreements uh types that we have
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
um but for the purposes of this I just
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to draw that out just to kind of
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
show how how large of a portfolio the
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
department does have with contractors
 
01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.470 align:start position:0%
department does have with contractors
um

01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:24.289 --> 01:05:24.299 align:start position:0%
now because of that the department has
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
has seen contractors and the Contracting
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
process the procurement process as
 
01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:32.339 align:start position:0%
critically important to our success
 
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
um back in 2018 we were receiving
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
complaints from the vendor Community the
 
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
Contracting process was taking too long
 
01:05:41.089 --> 01:05:41.099 align:start position:0%
some of the contracts
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
um were taking a year and a half to get
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
out which was which was Far Below which
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
was Far Beyond acceptable
 
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
um the the leadership team at that point
 
01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
in time devoted a considerable focus and
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
resources to making the process better
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
so on page 19 you will see back in 2018
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
we did Implement a lean Six Sigma demeic
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's you it's a process whereby you
 
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
define what you're doing you establish
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
the system to measure what you're doing
 
01:06:14.569 --> 01:06:14.579 align:start position:0%
then you begin to assess what are the
 
01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
results of that and then you make
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
improvements to your system and then you
 
01:06:21.049 --> 01:06:21.059 align:start position:0%
control for those improvements and and
 
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
that has led to a variety of really
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
really positive improvements our
 
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
processing time in 2018 was 140 142 days
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
from start to finish it's now at 94 days
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
and many of those outliers where things
 
01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
were taking a year and a half are now
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
generally a thing of the past
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
um we and I I won't go through through
 
01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:45.299 align:start position:0%
each one of these details given the time
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
but long story short we've made I.T
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
um we've Incorporated I.T Solutions uh
 
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.329 align:start position:0%
um we've Incorporated I.T Solutions uh
DocuSign

01:06:52.329 --> 01:06:52.339 align:start position:0%
DocuSign
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
e-signature that has taken a process
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
that took weeks I think the fastest
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
we've cut it down to is 27 days where we
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
sign base sign and the AG approves it's
 
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
pretty incredible the changes that have
 
01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
been made on that we're currently in the
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
process of rolling out a contract life
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
cycle management system that will
 
01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
further accelerate the creation of the
 
01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
rfps which historically have been email
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
based which is a really bad way to work
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
on a document when 12 people need to be
 
01:07:20.809 --> 01:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
involved and then lastly the
 
01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
commissioner earlier did mention the
 
01:07:24.049 --> 01:07:24.059 align:start position:0%
smart sheets application we're also
 
01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:26.700 align:start position:0%
incorporating that to get out of excel
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
which is inherently risk prone from my
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
perspective and manual to implement
 
01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
Implement a smartsheet solution which
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
will further automate
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
um that and Meredith is here to talk
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
about the the contents on on page 20
 
01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:47.339 align:start position:0%
relative to contracts quality management
 
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
and the role that her team is going to
 
01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
be playing in that going forward
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
before welcome uh before you get into
 
01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
that uh this is sort of a commissioner
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
question maybe as I think about
 
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
um your your management environment and
 
01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
and the importance of these 400 plus
 
01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
contractors are to getting the job done
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
it it feels to me like there's a whole
 
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
lot of Goo that you have to Wade through
 
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
in order to actually get direct contact
 
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
with what's going on
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
um and goo is not a an acronym but but
 
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
uh I I I'm just I I would like to have a
 
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
conversation with you at some point
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
about how Nimble you think all of this
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
is given given the amount that we rely
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
on these contractors this really I think
 
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
inherently needs to be a very Nimble
 
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
process for you to be able to articulate
 
01:08:49.329 --> 01:08:49.339 align:start position:0%
needs look for the responses select
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
engage and then if need be you know
 
01:08:56.329 --> 01:08:56.339 align:start position:0%
terminate and I'm and and and so that's
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
a lot that you're not prepared to talk
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
about I don't think but you know
 
01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
actually could respond I don't I don't
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
know can you hear me without the
 
01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
microphone you need a microphone for the
 
01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.390 align:start position:0%
microphone you need a microphone for the
public

01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
so goo the
 
01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:12.500 align:start position:0%
I think I think it's government
 
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
operations or something okay I'll go
 
01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
um that first bubble that I was talking
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
about um the quality piece that that so
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
I just want to give credit Nathan um in
 
01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
2018 was leading our contracts unit and
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
his charge was to streamline and make
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
efficient and all these processes and
 
01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
he's done a great job and the person
 
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
that is in the position now has done a
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
great job so in terms of we narrowed
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
down the goo we have a better angle on
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
it and this this focus in on uh the the
 
01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
contracts and the monitoring is going to
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
be the focus for this year so in terms
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
of system streamline we've made a lot of
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
gains I've been there a long time I've
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
never seen it as Nimble as it is now for
 
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
us to be able to say that we can cut it
 
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
down from 141 to high 90s is amazing and
 
01:09:58.370 --> 01:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
we can cut it down a little bit more
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
from there so we can get better how we
 
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
execute but we also can get better at
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
how we measure outcomes and and impacts
 
01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
does that answer that's a great answer I
 
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
I I'm just I'm just sort of thinking of
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
the of the negative aspect of this uh do
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
you do you do you believe you have a
 
01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
enough metrics to uh and tools uh and um
 
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
public support to terminate contracts
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
because you know taking somebody's money
 
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
away can be painful so so I'm just
 
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
curious if if uh if you find yourself
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
really empowered to let contractors go
 
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
when you think the time has come
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I guess I guess there's the
 
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
angle of terminating the contractor or
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
working with the contractor to get it
 
01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:45.410 align:start position:0%
working with the contractor to get it
right

01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
um you know we have the ability to
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
terminate contracts we have um but that
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
comes at a cost right so not just a
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
financial cost but a cost of who's no
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
longer suddenly receiving their services
 
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
and filling that Gap and then trying to
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
find somebody so I hear what you're
 
01:10:59.450 --> 01:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
saying but I also would like to look at
 
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
it that can we improve who we have doing
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
what they're doing so that they can that
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
they can be meeting the expectations but
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
we always have that if we need to pull
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
that lever
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I I just find that 400
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
plus daunting but
 
01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
that's why you're doing it we've got a
 
01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:17.699 align:start position:0%
rhythm we're in a we're in a hum right
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
now with in terms of how we've
 
01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
structured our um our contracts teams
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
how they I mean just from the whole
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
review it's I'm Gonna Knock on Wood
 
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
because I don't want it to to jinx it
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
but we're we're in a decent operational
 
01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
a question to uh representative walner
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
um I think that the 400 contractors are
 
01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:44.060 align:start position:0%
of course are helping you
 
01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
you know to succeed at the mission of
 
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
the department and what are you hearing
 
01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
from them I wondered I doubt that you
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
have this but do you have any idea how
 
01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
many employees these 400 contractors
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
have totally and what are you hearing
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
from the field out there about their
 
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
ability to hire and their vacancy rates
 
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
yeah interestingly enough right before
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
this I was speaking with a group of
 
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
Center for non-profits and their
 
01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
Workforce is about 15 of of the
 
01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
workforce in the state right and they're
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
doing our business right so the things
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
that we can't we can't do and they're
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
struggling as well so we were really
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
talking about how do we complement
 
01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
resources and not compete how do we work
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
together to fill that pipe how do we
 
01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
unclog this system
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
right that's a that's bigger than any
 
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:31.970 align:start position:0%
right that's a that's bigger than any
one

01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
um thing
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
um and and the challenges that they have
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
with our Contracting we talked a lot
 
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
about that in terms of you know the
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
improvements we've made but what else
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
can we be doing as well to make it
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
easier for them to be able to be nimble
 
01:12:47.689 --> 01:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
I just wondered in your meeting with the
 
01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
non-profits did they talk about their
 
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
Workforce I mean what kinds of
 
01:12:56.450 --> 01:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
percentages uh
 
01:12:59.090 --> 01:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
Workforce are they down
 
01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
um they didn't give me a number
 
01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.850 align:start position:0%
um they didn't give me a number
specifically

01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
um I I think we know from the work that
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
we do that when we can't put people in
 
01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
placements because they don't have the
 
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
staff but I didn't get a specific number
 
01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
welcome Miss Meredith tell us I'm going
 
01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
to work on your last name
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
t-e-l-u-s-u-s and the ooh pretend it has
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
an um so it's like goo it's oh good I
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
know that you got it and I I think
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
government organization
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
if I had to do the acronym that's what
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
I'm coming up
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you it's our goo that we work in
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
every day good morning everyone my name
 
01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
is Meredith Telus I'm the director of
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
our division of program quality and
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
integrity for the department and I
 
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk to you this morning a
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
little bit about our contracts quality
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
management unit which is a newly stood
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
up unit and also uh broadly just discuss
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
kind of metrics at the department and
 
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.010 align:start position:0%
kind of metrics at the department and
specifically

01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
um uh direct you to Form B which is
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
something representative Edwards and I
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
have discussed on a couple occasions so
 
01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh first slide slide 20.
 
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh is to discuss our contracts quality
 
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
management unit so our division is is
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
relatively new in terms of the structure
 
01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
of the department we were stood up right
 
01:14:26.689 --> 01:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
before covid started so
 
01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
um that was an interesting experience
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
many functions within the division
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
already existed this was just an
 
01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:33.900 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring them together to do
 
01:14:36.169 --> 01:14:36.179 align:start position:0%
things simultaneously so a lot of
 
01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
internal and external audit a lot of
 
01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
quality review a lot of performance
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
evaluation program evaluation kind of
 
01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:44.570 align:start position:0%
evaluation program evaluation kind of
metrics

01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
metrics
 
01:14:46.490 --> 01:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
um all just sort of coming together at
 
01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
once had been being done already but
 
01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
this was a chance to bring them together
 
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
and then building off of the work that
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
had been done in the contracts unit over
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
the course of 2020
 
01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
um about a year ago or so the former
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner commissioner shimanet with
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
the direction from then Deputy
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Weaver
 
01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
um said we we want to stand up a
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
particular function within the division
 
01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
that can just work on contracts quality
 
01:15:17.689 --> 01:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
management and so it's the focus of this
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
unit really is
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
um on the 400 contractors that are
 
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
delivering services to the citizens so
 
01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
from the former two slides that you saw
 
01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
where there are some contractors that
 
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
deliver Services sort of to us and then
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
there are others that deliver to the
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
citizens it's the ones to the citizens
 
01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
that were particularly focused on for
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
this unit and we managed to identify and
 
01:15:40.729 --> 01:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
fund a couple of positions so it's a
 
01:15:42.649 --> 01:15:42.659 align:start position:0%
two-person unit just to be clear it's
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
not a gigantic unit and the thrust of it
 
01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
really is to
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
um sort of track and evaluate the
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
quality of the services that are being
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
provided so as you can imagine
 
01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
with only two people they are not
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
tracking and evaluating the quality of
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
400 contracts that's not how it's set up
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
the focus of it is that we're going to
 
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
set up uh the tools and the systems that
 
01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
can be used across all of our individual
 
01:16:12.169 --> 01:16:12.179 align:start position:0%
program areas who are the contract
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
owners for these 400 contracts and then
 
01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
there are going to be some contracts
 
01:16:20.689 --> 01:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
that we want to delve into more closely
 
01:16:22.729 --> 01:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
meaning that the unit will be able to
 
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
really work hand in hand with those
 
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
program areas on their specific
 
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
contracts so Step One is sort of to
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
develop a tool so that we can evaluate
 
01:16:35.209 --> 01:16:35.219 align:start position:0%
which of our contracts have a higher
 
01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
strategic impact and those are the ones
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
that that we will step in and kind of
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
really work with people on and then and
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
then develop other just generic contract
 
01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
management tools that we can hand over
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
to program areas and say here you might
 
01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
want to use this from our strategic
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
Impact Tool it looks like this has a
 
01:16:55.729 --> 01:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
medium strategic impact therefore we
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
would suggest do you utilize these
 
01:16:59.570 --> 01:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
particular tools guidelines best
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
practices whatever it is to help you
 
01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
manage this contract more on your own
 
01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
so I I want to really emphasize that
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
contract management is happening now
 
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
across the department in every program
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
area on every contract it's already
 
01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.110 align:start position:0%
area on every contract it's already
happening

01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
but the people who do the contract
 
01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:20.900 align:start position:0%
management today are program area
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
Specialists right they're subject matter
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
experts in that program so it might be
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
it might be um an sud recovery service
 
01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
and the person who's managing that
 
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
contract knows everything about sud
 
01:17:34.729 --> 01:17:34.739 align:start position:0%
recovery they know the Clinical Services
 
01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
that they intend to get provided they
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
know the they know the provider they
 
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
know the beneficiaries they know what
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
they want it to look like but they're
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a subject matter in
 
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
contract management that the there are
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
best practices in contract management
 
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
that you can study and get good at
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's not their area of expertise so
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
the focus of this unit is for us to have
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
that expertise and be able to work with
 
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
them to help them get better at managing
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
the contracts
 
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
hopefully that makes sense so
 
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
strengthening the standardized process
 
01:18:09.169 --> 01:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
for contract management is sort of one
 
01:18:10.729 --> 01:18:10.739 align:start position:0%
of our short-term goals that we've
 
01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
already been working on in developing
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
those tools
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
but when we talked about contract
 
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
contract management that's really the
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
the middle section of owning a contract
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
right so you execute the contract
 
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
everybody signed it I said I want these
 
01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
services from you you said yep I'll do
 
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
it and then I need to have some system
 
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
where I'm evaluating whether or not
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
you're doing it and that's this is the
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
middle section until until we close out
 
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
that contract that's what's happening
 
01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:38.750 align:start position:0%
that contract that's what's happening
there

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
long term we're going to get to contract
 
01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:44.219 align:start position:0%
life cycle management that's where we're
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
going from here and contract life cycle
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
management is literally you can picture
 
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
like one of those circles I should have
 
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
put a graphic on the page but picture
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
one of those circles that has you know a
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
bunch of arrows at all point the same
 
01:18:58.729 --> 01:18:58.739 align:start position:0%
direction or you can picture a snake
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
eating its tail whatever graphic works
 
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
for you but picture something that's in
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
a circle and what you do is start
 
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
starting kind of at the beginning right
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a service or a
 
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
delivery that's like you know a twinkle
 
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
in someone's eye we would be able to sit
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
with that person in that program area
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
and say how does this align with your
 
01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:20.699 align:start position:0%
strategic goals
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
and then come up with okay we understand
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
how it aligns with your strategic goals
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
now you're going to enter into the
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
contract for these Services what are the
 
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
metrics that you're going to gather
 
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
what's the data that this contractor is
 
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
going to report to you or that you're
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
going to get from some other data source
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
what are you going to get to show you
 
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
whether or not this contract is doing
 
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
those things I feel a question coming on
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I you know because I don't really
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
know how many people you have to do this
 
01:19:48.169 --> 01:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
and you just said something I think
 
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
that's really important is you're you're
 
01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:54.020 align:start position:0%
engaging I assume you consider the
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
program managers like clients internal
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
clients uh you're engaging your internal
 
01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
clients before they've issued an RFP
 
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
well before that you're helping them
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
clarify the Strategic goals and and what
 
01:20:11.689 --> 01:20:11.699 align:start position:0%
the metrics are and you're big you're
 
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
able to embed that I'm guessing then
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
therefore in the RFP as a as a set of
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
requirements that's the goal we're not
 
01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
there yet but yes that's where we want
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
how good are you at that I mean are you
 
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
are you getting like the top 20 percent
 
01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
really big contracts you get in the top
 
01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
80 you know I I'm it's not even a
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
question you could should be asked but I
 
01:20:36.530 --> 01:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
I am just curious
 
01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
because we talked about this is what is
 
01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:41.219 align:start position:0%
your 10-year plan are you going to get
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
to that to where you you feel like
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
you've got the resourcing and
 
01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:50.219 align:start position:0%
integration with the management so that
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
in 10 years from now we've got you know
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
great contract metrics we got great
 
01:20:59.209 --> 01:20:59.219 align:start position:0%
internal Department metrics we've got a
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
review and evaluation you know I I we're
 
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
in year three of of you growing your
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
capability so I'm just trying to
 
01:21:09.890 --> 01:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
understand you know kind of where we're
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
at and what the coming attractions are
 
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
and and what we need to be thinking in
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
order to get to where we may really want
 
01:21:21.649 --> 01:21:21.659 align:start position:0%
to be yep so a couple things one is that
 
01:21:23.770 --> 01:21:23.780 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner mentioned one of her
 
01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
commitments is to sort of work to
 
01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
elevate this part of the department so
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
we will have that strategic Direction as
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
a department and we will be able to work
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
more closely with the program areas
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
to accomplish that as far as the metrics
 
01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
go I mean data is always the issue right
 
01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
it's it takes an enormous amount of work
 
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
clean data
 
01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
that is that is
 
01:21:52.850 --> 01:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
um relevant to the task at hand and
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
actionable and that's why you really
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
want to have I have the two people to
 
01:21:58.490 --> 01:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
answer your question on that so I have
 
01:21:58.500 --> 01:21:59.810 align:start position:0%
answer your question on that so I have
two

01:21:59.810 --> 01:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
um and to be able to have those
 
01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:04.460 align:start position:0%
conversations with the program areas
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
pre-rfp that's really the hurdle is
 
01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
being able to to say we need to pause
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
here and have this conversation so that
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
we can make sure that as you enter the
 
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
RFP and you enter into a contract we've
 
01:22:18.649 --> 01:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
got data that's meaningful behind it
 
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
that is a big lift it really is but we
 
01:22:25.130 --> 01:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
have a lot of strategy Direction headed
 
01:22:26.689 --> 01:22:26.699 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
um I will say you asked earlier kind of
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
the impact of the back of the budget cut
 
01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
one of the impacts from my division's
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
perspective is it's it can be difficult
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
to get the attention of the program
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
areas when they need to be working on
 
01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
their day-to-day so fully then we kind
 
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
of say well we have to slow down this
 
01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
contract process so that we can have
 
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
this conversation that but it's
 
01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
proactive but those proactive things can
 
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
kind of get put to the side while people
 
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
need to get through the day and get
 
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
contract signed so they can get Services
 
01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:58.669 align:start position:0%
contract signed so they can get Services
delivered

01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
do you have a representative from the
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
I.T community that sits in with you on
 
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
those pre-rfp meetings to help you
 
01:23:09.169 --> 01:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
figure out how to efficiently get at
 
01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
some of that data so we're not at the
 
01:23:13.729 --> 01:23:13.739 align:start position:0%
point yet where we're really doing the
 
01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
pre-rfp phase right now we're working on
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
the contract management phase but we
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
will shift forward so that working on
 
01:23:24.169 --> 01:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
the pre-i pre-rfp phase and I'll let
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
Nathan answer your question and and um
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
there there is a fairly robust
 
01:23:31.729 --> 01:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
um process that occurs right now uh to
 
01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
summarize very quickly basically an area
 
01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:36.300 align:start position:0%
of the department they put in a request
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
to our centralized contracts team they
 
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
answer a series of questions relative to
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
risky whether it's privacy security what
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
type of procurement do they expect what
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
type of services are delivered
 
01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
anticipated delivery date dollar amount
 
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
and then there's a kickoff meeting where
 
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
we invite the appropriate party so we
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
invite privacy security we invite
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
project management if it's particularly
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
complex we may invite particular
 
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
attorneys from a certain area if that
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
requires it and there's an initial
 
01:24:07.850 --> 01:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
planning meeting from which the whole
 
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
project then moves forward because there
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
may be anywhere from five to up to 15
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
people involved in any particular
 
01:24:16.490 --> 01:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
request for proposal depending upon the
 
01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:18.709 align:start position:0%
request for proposal depending upon the
complexity

01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
complexity
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just for those of you on the
 
01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
committee who are going oh this has got
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with Finance it's almost
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
the point right that we're meeting
 
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
before the numbers are released uh what
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm I'm trying to understand is the
 
01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
connection between our responsibility to
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
provide appropriate levels of Manpower
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
and money to the mission and and what
 
01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
the impact or the you know when we turn
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
over those resources
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
how that gets generated into actual
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
services for the state so so that's
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
where that's the conversation we're
 
01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
having now if you're wondering why we're
 
01:24:59.810 --> 01:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
not talking about money
 
01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
so the follow-up to the RFP phase and
 
01:25:07.130 --> 01:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
identifying what what data matters what
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
metrics are actually going to help you
 
01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
measure this contract and then
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
implementing it into a contract you then
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
are trying to manage to that data you're
 
01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
getting reports out of it and the tail
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
end of a contract ideally is that you
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
can you know within the within the
 
01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
course of the life of the contract
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
you're managing the contractor with that
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
information but you're simultaneously
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
looking at whether or not it actually
 
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
that contract that strategy that you've
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
employed and using that contract is
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
getting you closer to your goals or is
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
it not and that's when you'd say we may
 
01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
need to change this contract we may need
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
to amend it or we need to change our
 
01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
strategy entirely and that's the back
 
01:25:48.169 --> 01:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
end of the cycle so then you get to
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
redirect the way that you're doing the
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
services entirely or or just tweak it
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
whatever the data is showing you you get
 
01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
to make some data-driven decisions
 
01:25:57.890 --> 01:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
around that and then you start the
 
01:25:59.330 --> 01:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
process again
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
so that would be the contract life cycle
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
yep with that slide another I think
 
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
that's your last slide slide one more
 
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
like 21. this is important this is where
 
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
you're going to give us a tutorial
 
01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:18.890 align:start position:0%
you're going to give us a tutorial
so

01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:21.649 --> 01:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
poor public health is Christian
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
School sorry
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I selected act completely at random a
 
01:26:29.689 --> 01:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
Form B just to put onto the
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
um slide deck so that you could see what
 
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
um Form B is a section of the agency
 
01:26:38.689 --> 01:26:38.699 align:start position:0%
budget submission that that identifies
 
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
activity level goals and performance
 
01:26:44.209 --> 01:26:44.219 align:start position:0%
metrics and it's just an area that the
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
department will every every agency every
 
01:26:49.090 --> 01:26:49.100 align:start position:0%
Department in state government
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
identifies specific goals specific
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
outputs and outcomes and then sets a
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
Target and then identifies for the
 
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
coming biennium the the so this would be
 
01:27:03.649 --> 01:27:03.659 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 goals for that particular
 
01:27:06.169 --> 01:27:06.179 align:start position:0%
measure whatever it is so in this case
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's the um uh Bureau of laboratory
 
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
services is what it is and I just wanted
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
this on here as an illustration for the
 
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
committee members so that you could see
 
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
what this is and how it works and that
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
it's available in the agency budget
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
submission which is online
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
part of our very large uh budget
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
submission but it's done at the at the
 
01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
activity level
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
so so one thing I I'd be interested in
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
it when we get down to this level
 
01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.709 align:start position:0%
it when we get down to this level
is

01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
um do we have what what is our statutory
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
requirement for for doing this is this a
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
federal statute that we're complying
 
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
with or a state RSA or state RSA well I
 
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
mean in this example but just in general
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
oh I I I I I would want to know okay or
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
is this is this a federal program a
 
01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
state federal program or uh for those
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
that don't know the commissioner
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
exercises some discretion on creating
 
01:28:12.649 --> 01:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
programs that don't necessarily have
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
statutory backup and so
 
01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
I I think there's some discretion that
 
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has to establish a
 
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
program that is not
 
01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
backed up by an RSA or federal
 
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
requirement directly
 
01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:32.570 align:start position:0%
requirement directly
I

01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
so I knew still I think she has an
 
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
answer if you're looking for a Lifeline
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
sure and and I think this may be where
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
the budget briefing book will help a lot
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
because every every account that we have
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
in that document has an RSA or or
 
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
authorizing statute or federal directive
 
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
or otherwise attached to that so so as
 
01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
we go through that process we'll be able
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
to tie each one of those to a specific
 
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
RSA outstanding and so what I think you
 
01:29:04.129 --> 01:29:04.139 align:start position:0%
just gently told me is that there are no
 
01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
programs that we're going to review that
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
so one example
 
01:29:15.890 --> 01:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
would be and there
 
01:29:17.570 --> 01:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
would be this contracts quality
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
management unit for example that is
 
01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
something that the commissioner decided
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
the former commissioner and the current
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner decided to do because they
 
01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
believed that it was necessary in order
 
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
to enact all of the other requirements
 
01:29:32.209 --> 01:29:32.219 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
all right and I'm I'm just saying that
 
01:29:36.290 --> 01:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
for context I just want to understand
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
what we're doing why we're doing it and
 
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
not not that I'm looking for things to
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
kill in case anyone's curious so that
 
01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
but I think that's helpful so you're
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
saying in the form B it would be helpful
 
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
to identify whether or not the
 
01:29:53.209 --> 01:29:53.219 align:start position:0%
goals outlined the targets and
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
objectives outlined are federal versus
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
State versus discretionary I you know
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
that's kind of stuff I think about but I
 
01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
think to Mr White's point that that
 
01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
information is in the briefing book and
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
I I I could cross reference it pretty
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
easily I think and and in the agency
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
budget it's also in the form a that
 
01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
precedes the Form B
 
01:30:19.729 --> 01:30:19.739 align:start position:0%
okay and so I I have a really bad memory
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
because everything was a blur last time
 
01:30:24.290 --> 01:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
we went through this were these were
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
these form bees a regular and this is a
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
miserable question were these form bees
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
a regular part of what we reviewed as we
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
went trijin and marching through the
 
01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
budget data no I don't think so you
 
01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.129 --> 01:30:45.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking I would like to see
 
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
these as we actually get into the
 
01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
governor's budget request process is is
 
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
that an easy to share with us when we're
 
01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
talking your budget so yes and no so
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
what what I was proposing and and maybe
 
01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
I can share an example with a committee
 
01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
is with our budget briefing book once we
 
01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
have the governor's figures we'll have
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
the RSA we'll have the program we'll
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
have the outcomes of the population
 
01:31:14.689 --> 01:31:14.699 align:start position:0%
serve delivery service we'll also have
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
the the accounting information for that
 
01:31:19.970 --> 01:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
specific account but what what my plan
 
01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
is right now we've been devising or
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
maybe that sounds a little too uh
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
surreptitious what we've been developing
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
sorry well we've been developing where
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
yeah we're up to something but
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
um what we've been developing is key
 
01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
metrics for that particular area that we
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
plan on lifting from the agency budget
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
to put it into that document because
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
because I I just don't I I don't want to
 
01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:42.350 align:start position:0%
because I I just don't I I don't want to
create

01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
create
 
01:31:44.450 --> 01:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
um additional work or or confusion where
 
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
are switching from the agency budget
 
01:31:47.689 --> 01:31:47.699 align:start position:0%
request which is going to have different
 
01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
dollar figures potentially than the
 
01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and and and then and
 
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
then shifting over to the budget
 
01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
briefing book so so my goal is to try to
 
01:31:59.689 --> 01:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
get all that into a single location for
 
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
for the committee to to make the work as
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
effective as possible see oh that sounds
 
01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
good and in my simple way I thought okay
 
01:32:10.370 --> 01:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
these form B's are already done and I
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
was trying to find a way to repurpose
 
01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
work to make us smarter while we're
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
doing it that's what my objective was
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
the challenge is that they're within a
 
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
2000 page document and we'd have to pull
 
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
them out from from this section and that
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
section or we just have to go through
 
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
them and reference page 743 when we come
 
01:32:32.810 --> 01:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
to a particular account so I'll I'll
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
defer to the committee on on on what you
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
would prefer my My Hope was to have that
 
01:32:42.729 --> 01:32:42.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative Northern you've chaired
 
01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
this committee before do you do you have
 
01:32:49.729 --> 01:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
any thoughts on the extent to which we
 
01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
want to have these form bees
 
01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
um readily accessible as we're going
 
01:32:57.709 --> 01:32:57.719 align:start position:0%
through the agency budgets or
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
because right now you go read them I
 
01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
think it'll keep you up all night
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
so I mean they're already there I mean
 
01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
maybe when you appear in front of us you
 
01:33:16.669 --> 01:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
can reference the number I think most of
 
01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:18.300 align:start position:0%
us are using
 
01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
some technology we could we could find
 
01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:24.780 align:start position:0%
them if we wanted to to reference them
 
01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
they're currently posted in the agency
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
budget submission
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
which is on the Das website if not the
 
01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
Gen also the general court website you
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
have a question representable thank you
 
01:33:37.550 --> 01:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
chairman so
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
at a high level and whether it's
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
internal staff or contracts
 
01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.149 align:start position:0%
internal staff or contracts
um

01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
what are you guys using As the metric
 
01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:47.870 align:start position:0%
what are you guys using As the metric
for

01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:33:50.450 --> 01:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
is are we actually hitting the objective
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
at the highest level Our Lives being
 
01:33:56.209 --> 01:33:56.219 align:start position:0%
saved is someone living longer what is
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
the foundation for this that you look
 
01:34:00.770 --> 01:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
back to to say yes we've done something
 
01:34:02.930 --> 01:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
right we've
 
01:34:04.970 --> 01:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
pick on any Department right Elder Care
 
01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
Services right we're seeing that
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
patients are living longer
 
01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
what are you using and how do we look at
 
01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
that information so we have data and
 
01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
metrics all across the department it
 
01:34:20.689 --> 01:34:20.699 align:start position:0%
is my division owns some of it largely
 
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
related to Medicaid dcyf has their own
 
01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
data Public Health has a whole Bureau
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
for data it is literally all over the
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
department all of our federal grants
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
require all kinds of data and
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
performance reporting in addition to the
 
01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
financial reporting that they do so that
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
exists and it's reported on on a regular
 
01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
basis and it's reviewed in terms of the
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
the outcomes that we're getting to
 
01:34:45.290 --> 01:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges is that as as we
 
01:34:47.689 --> 01:34:47.699 align:start position:0%
look at the budget so let me have I'll
 
01:34:49.129 --> 01:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
answer your question in two parts one of
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
the challenges is that as we look at the
 
01:34:52.490 --> 01:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
budget that data does not necessarily
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
cleanly align with the way the budget is
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
split up because it doesn't right
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
because programs cross areas Medicaid is
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
a perfect example of this Medicaid
 
01:35:02.450 --> 01:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
exists all over the department everyone
 
01:35:04.189 --> 01:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
in the department is working to keep the
 
01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid train going the direction we
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
want it to go so there are metrics
 
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
related to Medicaid that we have a whole
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
website our mqis Medicaid quality
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
information system website tells you all
 
01:35:16.729 --> 01:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
kinds of metrics related to how well the
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid population is doing in the
 
01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
state but I can't tie that cleanly just
 
01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
into the Medicaid accounting unit
 
01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:25.850 align:start position:0%
into the Medicaid accounting unit
because

01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:25.860 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
six different divisions are working on
 
01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
those metrics and working with our mcos
 
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
and working with our providers to make
 
01:35:33.709 --> 01:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
it work so that's that's one thing
 
01:35:35.450 --> 01:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
another thing I just want to mention is
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
that there are metrics that tell us how
 
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
well the population is doing right our
 
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
population Health outcomes and those are
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
the things we all really care about are
 
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
people dying at a younger age are people
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
um um quitting tobacco are they
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
um or at prenatal care is another good
 
01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.530 align:start position:0%
um or at prenatal care is another good
example

01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:35:55.970 --> 01:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
um so we can look at that I mean with
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid population we have a little
 
01:35:59.090 --> 01:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
more ownership over it but for a lot of
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
population Health outcomes the
 
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
department doesn't own the whole
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
population right we own individual
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
programs and we work with other people
 
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
to make those programs effective so it
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
but it's dependent on community level
 
01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
providers it's dependent on the
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
education system it's dependent on local
 
01:36:20.689 --> 01:36:20.699 align:start position:0%
state and the police and fire and at a
 
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
community level you're all working
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
together to make a single population
 
01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
Health outcome work or not work so we do
 
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
collect those things but they don't they
 
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
don't always align exactly to the budget
 
01:36:34.129 --> 01:36:34.139 align:start position:0%
they don't always align exactly to your
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
contract and so that's where we kind of
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
break it down a little bit into smaller
 
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:40.139 align:start position:0%
chunks so that we can measure whether or
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
not a program is working or a contract
 
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
is working
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
that's a long-winded answer to your
 
01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
question but
 
01:36:50.570 --> 01:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
I hope it helps I think the takeaway is
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
by year 10 you'll have all those things
 
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
aligned figure it out we're on our way
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
okay so are you done with your prepared
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
remarks I I I I I still would like to
 
01:37:04.970 --> 01:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
see you know your we're year three of a
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
10-year plan what what what are the
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
Coming Attractions I'd like to see that
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
so I think one thing that will happen is
 
01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
as we move into the budget the the
 
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
commissioner will be able to come back
 
01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:16.139 align:start position:0%
and provide her broader
 
01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
um commitments area and the deliverables
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
associated with those and we'll be
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
looking at those and how they align from
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
the Department level down into the
 
01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
divisions down into the activities down
 
01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
into our contracts and how can we get
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
these things to kind of cascade upward
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
and downward in a way that when we
 
01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%
prepare metrics for you all for our for
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
our budget or for public consumption it
 
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
it is aligned and you can sort of
 
01:37:43.250 --> 01:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
measure that okay thank you do you think
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're done with your section here
 
01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:49.139 align:start position:0%
so we hit positions metric Works do you
 
01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.490 --> 01:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
because those were all together in on my
 
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.669 align:start position:0%
because those were all together in on my
sheet

01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:03.179 align:start position:0%
the the the question of the um the the
 
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
potential salary increases for state
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
employees yeah I mean I see oh I see is
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
a bullet that under HHS uh a road map
 
01:38:14.090 --> 01:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
the third bullet was salary do you want
 
01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
to tell me what that was Mr Ripple do
 
01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
you know what that means
 
01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
you did your initial request of the
 
01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
department did have to do with the
 
01:38:23.810 --> 01:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
potential increase in salary for state
 
01:38:26.689 --> 01:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
employees or any uh hiring and retention
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
bonuses that HHS might do and where the
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
money for those things might come from
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
right and so it doesn't seem like that's
 
01:38:36.530 --> 01:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
right for today then because the state
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
plan overall is not in place and you're
 
01:38:43.370 --> 01:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
only 29 of that plan anyways right so
 
01:38:45.649 --> 01:38:45.659 align:start position:0%
you're waiting I I think it may be a
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
more fruitful discussion after February
 
01:38:50.209 --> 01:38:50.219 align:start position:0%
14th November's budget comes out so so
 
01:38:52.129 --> 01:38:52.139 align:start position:0%
that's a good question uh when the
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
governor gives his uh Speech To Us in
 
01:38:56.810 --> 01:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
the House of Representatives
 
01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:57.910 align:start position:0%
the House of Representatives
um

01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
representative Hall what when will we be
 
01:39:04.610 --> 01:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
able to have our first division three
 
01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:05.450 align:start position:0%
able to have our first division three
meeting

01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
15th or more 16th excuse me February
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
15th the 15th of February 16th
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
you can get started right away I don't
 
01:39:16.610 --> 01:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
believe a full committee meeting has
 
01:39:18.110 --> 01:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
been held yet so typically as soon as
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget comes out uh the
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
governor and his budget director will
 
01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
come and present to the full finance
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
committee and then the divisions will
 
01:39:26.209 --> 01:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
break up and start meeting I don't
 
01:39:27.649 --> 01:39:27.659 align:start position:0%
believe that initial meeting has been
 
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
scheduled yet but
 
01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
assuming is scheduled in the near future
 
01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
I think you could start meeting
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
soon after the 15th okay because because
 
01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
we should start scheduling that or at
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
least pencil in it in oh oh I'll see if
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
I can talk to the finance Vice chair
 
01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
about that that meeting so uh all right
 
01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
um I think what we ought to do now is
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
because if anyone who wants to go to the
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
cafeteria they may shut down at one I'm
 
01:40:00.410 --> 01:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
proposing we recess let people go get
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
something to eat clear their head a
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
little bit and come back at 110
 
01:40:08.209 --> 01:40:08.219 align:start position:0%
does that how does that sound do you
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative Northern take about a 30
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:20.770 --> 01:40:20.780 align:start position:0%
the rest of the plan for the afternoon
 
01:40:23.570 --> 01:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
is uh I believe we're going to hear from
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
Ms Tilly on public health we're going to
 
01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
hear from somebody else on the Hampstead
 
01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:30.229 align:start position:0%
hear from somebody else on the Hampstead
Hospital

01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
those were uh we we were referencing uh
 
01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple's email of uh
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
31 January that he forward that to us
 
01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
so we have we still have some some
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
you're okay okay so uh Miss uh
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative Hall is there a sequence
 
01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
for the events this afternoon in terms
 
01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
of which presentations at what time or
 
01:40:59.209 --> 01:40:59.219 align:start position:0%
at least in what which order
 
01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:00.980 align:start position:0%
the the the the
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's a good point it indicates that
 
01:41:06.110 --> 01:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital is expecting to go at
 
01:41:08.510 --> 01:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
one o'clock I'm proposing that we start
 
01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
more like 110 and and then the public
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
health said 130 or two okay so I think
 
01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
they did that hoping that we'd not spend
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of time talking so
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you okay all right uh with that uh
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:43.490 --> 02:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
all right it's uh it's 1 14. I think we
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
have a quorum I think representative
 
02:15:47.810 --> 02:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
nordgren is probably just around the
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
corner and she'll show up any moment so

so so what you didn't say maybe you were
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
just about to is
 
02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
um because the state has taken over
 
02:17:16.310 --> 02:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
Hampstead fairly recently you know could
 
02:17:17.690 --> 02:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
you could you also make sure we
 
02:17:19.849 --> 02:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
understand your longevity your record
 
02:17:25.250 --> 02:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:27.230 --> 02:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
28 years
 
02:17:29.570 --> 02:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
so I'm a long-standing member of
 
02:17:32.810 --> 02:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital's uh Community
 
02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:34.129 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital's uh Community
um

02:17:34.129 --> 02:17:34.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:37.490 --> 02:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
I was the CEO at Hampstead Hospital
 
02:17:41.929 --> 02:17:41.939 align:start position:0%
prior to the the state taking over and I
 
02:17:44.509 --> 02:17:44.519 align:start position:0%
worked there as a counselor for many
 
02:17:48.250 --> 02:17:48.260 align:start position:0%
many years moved up into unit management
 
02:17:52.129 --> 02:17:52.139 align:start position:0%
and then also decided that I wanted to
 
02:17:56.330 --> 02:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
take things into a more business side of
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
things and started working in
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
administration and working towards that
 
02:18:04.730 --> 02:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
and I will let you give
 
02:18:08.450 --> 02:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
yes so I um I started in uh late August
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
so I've been here about five months at
 
02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampstead previously I was um executive
 
02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:15.650 align:start position:0%
Hampstead previously I was um executive
director

02:18:15.650 --> 02:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
director
 
02:18:18.169 --> 02:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
um uh for Genesis HealthCare and uh
 
02:18:20.330 --> 02:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
worked in nursing homes for the last uh
 
02:18:28.910 --> 02:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
so it looks like you have a presentation
 
02:18:35.450 --> 02:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
and uh so the way the way we can do this
 
02:18:37.310 --> 02:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
she didn't see the morning stuff did you
 
02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
yeah because she have real jobs I
 
02:18:42.169 --> 02:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
understand so
 
02:18:44.209 --> 02:18:44.219 align:start position:0%
um so we're I'm gonna just let you go
 
02:18:46.849 --> 02:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
through this and before you flip to the
 
02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
next page uh you may want to just look
 
02:18:51.349 --> 02:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
up in case I want to get your attention
 
02:18:54.770 --> 02:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
and uh and we'll you know anyone might
 
02:18:56.209 --> 02:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
02:18:59.089 --> 02:18:59.099 align:start position:0%
um so perfect all right none of them are
 
02:19:02.570 --> 02:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
particularly hard I I think I think my
 
02:19:06.410 --> 02:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
my frame of mind going into this is that
 
02:19:08.929 --> 02:19:08.939 align:start position:0%
um the Hampstead Hospital is a strategic
 
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
asset and are taking care of kids youth
 
02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
for the mental health and Behavioral
 
02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
Health Sciences and uh it is a site that
 
02:19:21.469 --> 02:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
often gets talked about as a potential
 
02:19:25.129 --> 02:19:25.139 align:start position:0%
site to co-locate the new sununu center
 
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
the replacement Center for sununu and
 
02:19:32.330 --> 02:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
the reason it might get cited along with
 
02:19:32.340 --> 02:19:33.730 align:start position:0%
the reason it might get cited along with
your

02:19:33.730 --> 02:19:33.740 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:19:38.450 --> 02:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
property is uh so the theory is through
 
02:19:40.969 --> 02:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
co-location that we may be able to
 
02:19:40.979 --> 02:19:42.310 align:start position:0%
co-location that we may be able to
leverage

02:19:42.310 --> 02:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
leverage
 
02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:44.349 align:start position:0%
leverage
staff

02:19:44.349 --> 02:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
other capabilities like maybe you have a
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
logistics Warehouse sort of thing or you
 
02:19:52.010 --> 02:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
know the ability to help out each other
 
02:19:54.590 --> 02:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
for weekend meals so we're not always
 
02:19:58.270 --> 02:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
Staffing kitchens all the time
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
nursing support in case somebody gets
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
hurt at 2 A.M you know how do we get
 
02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
them emergency care that kind of stuff
 
02:20:09.410 --> 02:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
is why we put co-location in and so as
 
02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
you're going through this I'm I'm going
 
02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
to be listening to to understand what
 
02:20:18.050 --> 02:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
what your what Your Capacity is now what
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
you're doing now you know why you're not
 
02:20:22.730 --> 02:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
doing more because you're probably built
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
to do more but you don't have a staff to
 
02:20:28.730 --> 02:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
do more and and what all of that that
 
02:20:31.490 --> 02:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
physical capacity and and Manpower
 
02:20:34.130 --> 02:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
capacity what kind of implications that
 
02:20:37.730 --> 02:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
may have for benefiting the co-location
 
02:20:39.889 --> 02:20:39.899 align:start position:0%
of a replacement Center for sununu
 
02:20:42.290 --> 02:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
that's my frame of mind we have new
 
02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
people in the committee that have no
 
02:20:46.010 --> 02:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
idea what a Hampstead Hospital is so we
 
02:20:48.349 --> 02:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
could you know whatever you tell us is
 
02:20:49.610 --> 02:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
going to be great news thank you
 
02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:52.020 align:start position:0%

02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital so
 
02:20:57.469 --> 02:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
all right fantastic so what I did do is
 
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
I included a photo of the actual
 
02:21:02.050 --> 02:21:02.060 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital
 
02:21:05.389 --> 02:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that any of you have ever
 
02:21:07.790 --> 02:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
actually been to the campus but it is
 
02:21:10.370 --> 02:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
beautiful it's been built on it was
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
built in 1974 on 100 Acre plus
 
02:21:14.399 --> 02:21:15.170 align:start position:0%
built in 1974 on 100 Acre plus
um

02:21:15.170 --> 02:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:19.250 --> 02:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
site so it's beautiful grounds
 
02:21:21.290 --> 02:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
um surrounded by trees and just wanted
 
02:21:22.969 --> 02:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
you to have a visual to go along with
 
02:21:22.979 --> 02:21:26.830 align:start position:0%
you to have a visual to go along with
that

02:21:26.830 --> 02:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry one of the things that I
 
02:21:31.490 --> 02:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that I explained is
 
02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:32.690 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that I explained is
that

02:21:32.690 --> 02:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:34.250 --> 02:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
um in case you're not aware that
 
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital
 
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
when the state took ownership of
 
02:21:40.849 --> 02:21:40.859 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital they subcont or
 
02:21:42.849 --> 02:21:42.859 align:start position:0%
contracted with a third party vendor
 
02:21:47.410 --> 02:21:47.420 align:start position:0%
well path Recovery Solutions for them to
 
02:21:51.050 --> 02:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
provide the Clinical Services and
 
02:21:53.929 --> 02:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
operate the hospital there and Sean will
 
02:21:55.730 --> 02:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
get into this a little bit later on but
 
02:21:59.210 --> 02:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
there is DHHS oversight we oversee the
 
02:22:03.309 --> 02:22:03.319 align:start position:0%
entire contract and oversee the facility
 
02:22:07.250 --> 02:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
at all times through our positions but
 
02:22:10.130 --> 02:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
we do partner with well path Recovery
 
02:22:10.140 --> 02:22:11.389 align:start position:0%
we do partner with well path Recovery
Solutions

02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
Solutions
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
so with our group we our executive team
 
02:22:18.650 --> 02:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
we had gone back to the drawing board to
 
02:22:21.290 --> 02:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
really come up with our new mission and
 
02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
vision of what Hampstead Hospital is
 
02:22:27.290 --> 02:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
looking to do and where we want to be
 
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
moving forward and our mission statement
 
02:22:32.270 --> 02:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
as you can see is really to provide
 
02:22:34.670 --> 02:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
trauma-inform patient and family
 
02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
centered mental health treatment and in
 
02:22:39.650 --> 02:22:39.660 align:start position:0%
accepting and supporting and supportive
 
02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:40.910 align:start position:0%
accepting and supporting and supportive
environment

02:22:40.910 --> 02:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
environment
 
02:22:43.309 --> 02:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
and then our vision
 
02:22:46.730 --> 02:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
is for us to be able to be the center of
 
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
excellence for mental health treatment
 
02:22:51.650 --> 02:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
of children adolescents and young adults
 
02:22:54.650 --> 02:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm an old broken down Army
 
02:22:56.750 --> 02:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Colonel uh that worked in
 
02:23:00.050 --> 02:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
healthcare services and and so I've been
 
02:23:02.570 --> 02:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
in and around mental health providers
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
for you know 40 50 years this phrase
 
02:23:09.050 --> 02:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed I think started to enter
 
02:23:13.190 --> 02:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
the Lexicon in the last decade I think
 
02:23:17.210 --> 02:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
uh what what does this term really do I
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
mean why why isn't this just embedded in
 
02:23:22.670 --> 02:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
what we do in a mental health
 
02:23:25.130 --> 02:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
environment why is it why has it become
 
02:23:27.650 --> 02:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
necessary to make sure everything is
 
02:23:34.969 --> 02:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:34.979 --> 02:23:36.110 align:start position:0%
 
said

02:23:36.110 --> 02:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:23:36.120 --> 02:23:38.030 align:start position:0%
said
um

02:23:38.030 --> 02:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:41.929 --> 02:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
that we take a look at the practices and
 
02:23:45.530 --> 02:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
so trauma-informed Care Now brings with
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
it there are a lot of evidence-based
 
02:23:51.230 --> 02:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
practices that come along with that and
 
02:23:53.630 --> 02:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
there's also a movement to really help
 
02:23:59.389 --> 02:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
and in to alleviate mental health stigma
 
02:24:01.610 --> 02:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
um within society and be able to
 
02:24:05.450 --> 02:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
understand for people to understand that
 
02:24:05.460 --> 02:24:06.230 align:start position:0%
understand for people to understand that
um

02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
everyone has been witness to trauma in
 
02:24:13.370 --> 02:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
their lives and then that the impact
 
02:24:15.650 --> 02:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
that that has at the different levels
 
02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
and stages of growth and development and
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
how you can treat them
 
02:24:21.889 --> 02:24:21.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:24:21.899 --> 02:24:23.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
absolutely

02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:24:25.610 --> 02:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
any other questions on that one before I
 
02:24:27.889 --> 02:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
move forward all right
 
02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
the next page is just a listing of our
 
02:24:35.330 --> 02:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
executive team and as you can see I did
 
02:24:38.330 --> 02:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
want to break down for you so there is
 
02:24:42.650 --> 02:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
the team of DHHS leaders and also our
 
02:24:44.889 --> 02:24:44.899 align:start position:0%
well path Recovery Solution
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:55.309 --> 02:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh as far as so these these five DHHS
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
employees that this this is really it
 
02:25:02.929 --> 02:25:02.939 align:start position:0%
other than the u5 everything else is
 
02:25:08.750 --> 02:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:20.570 --> 02:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
so moving forward
 
02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
um into the overview for hhrtf
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
um the state took ownership June 8th of
 
02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:28.130 align:start position:0%
um the state took ownership June 8th of
2022.

02:25:28.130 --> 02:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
02:25:30.530 --> 02:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
um we were really focusing at that point
 
02:25:33.490 --> 02:25:33.500 align:start position:0%
on being able to increase the efforts
 
02:25:36.230 --> 02:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
post-pandemic uh for recruiting and
 
02:25:37.730 --> 02:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
retention so that we were able to
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
increase the bed capacity
 
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
um for Hampstead
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
the average census since June 8th has
 
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
been approximately 36 patients and we're
 
02:25:51.730 --> 02:25:51.740 align:start position:0%
continuing to increase
 
02:25:55.730 --> 02:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
those numbers through Recruitment and
 
02:25:57.410 --> 02:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
Retention strategies
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
the average weightless since June 8 was
 
02:26:02.830 --> 02:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
13 patients
 
02:26:06.590 --> 02:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
waiting for beds at our facility
 
02:26:11.389 --> 02:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
we've seen since being State involved
 
02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
that we've had an increased
 
02:26:16.429 --> 02:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
collaboration with dcyf division for
 
02:26:17.770 --> 02:26:17.780 align:start position:0%
Youth and children
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
and then also with the division for
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health we've been able to
 
02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:24.550 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health we've been able to
actually

02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
incorporate weekly meetings so that
 
02:26:29.389 --> 02:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
we're able to really take a look at each
 
02:26:32.030 --> 02:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
individual child and what their needs
 
02:26:36.110 --> 02:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
are and where we can best treat and
 
02:26:38.690 --> 02:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
serve them throughout our system of care
 
02:26:41.330 --> 02:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
um that was a welcome change
 
02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
um for me to be able to be part of that
 
02:26:48.889 --> 02:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
so that we can we can do that work
 
02:26:51.950 --> 02:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
um just a little information our patient
 
02:26:54.830 --> 02:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
and family satisfaction surveys our
 
02:26:56.929 --> 02:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
results have been
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
um 90 of satisfaction
 
02:27:02.330 --> 02:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
and then our annual average readmission
 
02:27:04.270 --> 02:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
rates remain
 
02:27:07.010 --> 02:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
approximately at four percent for those
 
02:27:09.410 --> 02:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
rapid readmissions which are within 30
 
02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:15.410 --> 02:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
sure so I have some questions about go
 
02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:27:18.650 --> 02:27:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
um I just have a question on the um the
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
range of the ages does a youth age out
 
02:27:25.610 --> 02:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
at 18 and and how young are the children
 
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
you're servicing absolutely and I will I
 
02:27:30.590 --> 02:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
should have ordered this a little bit
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
differently maybe
 
02:27:34.370 --> 02:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
um I will get into that too but we take
 
02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
ages four
 
02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
um up through 17 as a designated
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
receiving facility and then we also care
 
02:27:46.730 --> 02:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
for patients 18 to 25.
 
02:27:49.849 --> 02:27:49.859 align:start position:0%
I represent Waller
 
02:27:51.230 --> 02:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:52.610 --> 02:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me what is the average
 
02:27:52.620 --> 02:27:55.250 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me what is the average
weight

02:27:55.250 --> 02:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:57.889 --> 02:27:57.899 align:start position:0%
so the average I don't have that with me
 
02:27:57.899 --> 02:27:59.510 align:start position:0%
so the average I don't have that with me
currently

02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:28:02.809 --> 02:28:02.819 align:start position:0%
um what it was last quarter so the end
 
02:28:06.349 --> 02:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
of quarter four was an average of seven
 
02:28:08.330 --> 02:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
days waiting
 
02:28:12.770 --> 02:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
um for our our highest triage level
 
02:28:14.450 --> 02:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:28:16.550 --> 02:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
um so I think I have three questions or
 
02:28:18.349 --> 02:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
simple one so
 
02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
um the cat form and uh I I keep
 
02:28:26.330 --> 02:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
forgetting what the acronym is but it's
 
02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
a it's a clinical assessment treatment
 
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
plan or something like that uh is is
 
02:28:34.670 --> 02:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
that is that integrated into our health
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
care System enough so that when these
 
02:28:40.010 --> 02:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
kids arrive at your facility a huge
 
02:28:43.389 --> 02:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
percentage of them has a cat already
 
02:28:46.490 --> 02:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
available or are you having to create
 
02:28:46.500 --> 02:28:47.990 align:start position:0%
available or are you having to create
them

02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:28:50.510 --> 02:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
we typically are not the ones that are
 
02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
generating those if they do come in to
 
02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
our facility and they've already been
 
02:28:58.130 --> 02:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
connected or they to a Community Mental
 
02:29:00.190 --> 02:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
Health Center or throughout the system
 
02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
they have already had that referral
 
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
there are times that they may come to
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
the facility and they haven't actually
 
02:29:08.809 --> 02:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
had the assessment completed and it will
 
02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
get completed while it's there but the
 
02:29:13.670 --> 02:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
process has been started already okay
 
02:29:15.770 --> 02:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
because that's a big theory about how
 
02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
we're trying to take care of kids right
 
02:29:18.650 --> 02:29:18.660 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get these early
 
02:29:21.469 --> 02:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
assessments and have the assessment move
 
02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
longitudinally with the child and and
 
02:29:28.130 --> 02:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
and hopefully have less discontinuity of
 
02:29:31.309 --> 02:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
care and and better results as a result
 
02:29:34.250 --> 02:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay so
 
02:29:36.110 --> 02:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned
 
02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
um your your head counts your census uh
 
02:29:41.450 --> 02:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
what what what's your vacancy rate
 
02:29:43.730 --> 02:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
generally on your clinical side the part
 
02:29:46.849 --> 02:29:46.859 align:start position:0%
that's affecting your your bed capacity
 
02:29:50.570 --> 02:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
um currently right now we are um staff
 
02:29:54.469 --> 02:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
ratio or sorry our vacancy rates are 52
 
02:29:59.150 --> 02:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
for direct care counselors and 39 for
 
02:29:59.160 --> 02:30:01.309 align:start position:0%
for direct care counselors and 39 for
nurses

02:30:01.309 --> 02:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
02:30:03.710 --> 02:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
those are vacancy rates right correct
 
02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:04.849 align:start position:0%
those are vacancy rates right correct
okay

02:30:04.849 --> 02:30:04.859 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:30:06.710 --> 02:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
oh my God
 
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
so so let's say you had both of those
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
components above 90 what what would that
 
02:30:15.770 --> 02:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
do to your bed capacity would you
 
02:30:17.809 --> 02:30:17.819 align:start position:0%
instead of being at 36 would you you'd
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
be at a much higher number but what
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
where do you think you'd be yeah
 
02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:23.030 align:start position:0%
where do you think you'd be yeah
absolutely

02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:30:25.969 --> 02:30:25.979 align:start position:0%
um and you'll see again the order of my
 
02:30:28.429 --> 02:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
way we're still excited about this
 
02:30:28.439 --> 02:30:30.349 align:start position:0%
way we're still excited about this
yeah

02:30:30.349 --> 02:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:30:33.950 --> 02:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
put it all in one slide okay next time I
 
02:30:37.010 --> 02:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
will I'll remind you you asked for that
 
02:30:40.429 --> 02:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
um so the the um currently today our
 
02:30:42.770 --> 02:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
census is actually 45. this is just what
 
02:30:44.570 --> 02:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
our averages are
 
02:30:48.530 --> 02:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
um so our current census is 45 uh and we
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
actually have 20
 
02:30:52.969 --> 02:30:52.979 align:start position:0%
um staff that we just hired that are in
 
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
orientation coming out of orientation of
 
02:30:58.910 --> 02:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
and of those people there are 11 of them
 
02:31:01.730 --> 02:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
are direct care so we will be able to
 
02:31:06.410 --> 02:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
stay within that 40 to 45 range and in
 
02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
addition to that we've also have
 
02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:10.210 align:start position:0%
addition to that we've also have
um

02:31:10.210 --> 02:31:10.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
anticipated 14 more employees 13 of
 
02:31:16.190 --> 02:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
which are direct care that are supposed
 
02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
to be starting on February 6th so we've
 
02:31:23.570 --> 02:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
definitely seen a a huge shift in
 
02:31:26.690 --> 02:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
applicants and folks that are coming on
 
02:31:28.670 --> 02:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
board to to take care of the patients
 
02:31:31.790 --> 02:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
which is great so how many of your
 
02:31:34.250 --> 02:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
residents are there on a non-voluntary
 
02:31:34.260 --> 02:31:35.510 align:start position:0%
residents are there on a non-voluntary
basis

02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
basis
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
currently I'm happy to say they're all
 
02:31:41.650 --> 02:31:41.660 align:start position:0%
voluntary okay voluntary by Guardian
 
02:31:45.770 --> 02:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
by so the guardian has asked for the the
 
02:31:48.590 --> 02:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
child to receive the residential
 
02:31:52.370 --> 02:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
treatment correct no court orders not
 
02:31:54.170 --> 02:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
right now could could you receive a
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
court order yes and you have in the past
 
02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes we have in the past
 
02:32:01.309 --> 02:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
um that's something that we're very
 
02:32:03.650 --> 02:32:03.660 align:start position:0%
proud of is
 
02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
um that our social workers and our
 
02:32:07.849 --> 02:32:07.859 align:start position:0%
clinical team really work well with the
 
02:32:11.090 --> 02:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
families to help to integrate them so it
 
02:32:13.730 --> 02:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
really comes down to
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
um truly only those children and
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
adolescents that don't meet
 
02:32:21.290 --> 02:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
um that their families really are
 
02:32:23.690 --> 02:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
opposed to them receiving any type of
 
02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
psychiatric treatment that end up on a
 
02:32:29.450 --> 02:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
true involuntary admission so so you all
 
02:32:31.130 --> 02:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
were in the news in the last week or so
 
02:32:34.969 --> 02:32:34.979 align:start position:0%
because uh one of the patients left the
 
02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
left the grounds
 
02:32:40.010 --> 02:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
and I think that caused a lot of
 
02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
confusion and concern about the sununu
 
02:32:44.809 --> 02:32:44.819 align:start position:0%
center being co-located so I just want
 
02:32:46.690 --> 02:32:46.700 align:start position:0%
to I just kind of want to make it clear
 
02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the Hampstead
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
Hospital is not intended or designed to
 
02:32:55.010 --> 02:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
be a secure facility there's no sort of
 
02:32:55.020 --> 02:32:56.090 align:start position:0%
be a secure facility there's no sort of
uh

02:32:56.090 --> 02:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:58.130 --> 02:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
well there's probably some little bit of
 
02:33:01.070 --> 02:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
lockdown between between Wards
 
02:33:02.929 --> 02:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
um could you could you talk about sort
 
02:33:06.050 --> 02:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
of the security posture uh I've heard
 
02:33:10.010 --> 02:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
things like uh sununu's a level five we
 
02:33:11.809 --> 02:33:11.819 align:start position:0%
don't have any other facilities or level
 
02:33:13.490 --> 02:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
five we have level fours and level
 
02:33:15.889 --> 02:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
threes what what help us understand the
 
02:33:17.809 --> 02:33:17.819 align:start position:0%
level of security that you have there
 
02:33:21.230 --> 02:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely can we switch to them is
 
02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
there actually another slide that oh all
 
02:33:28.490 --> 02:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
right okay very good oh oh you know but
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
did you tell me what your maximum bed
 
02:33:32.330 --> 02:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
capacity would be if you had all your
 
02:33:36.969 --> 02:33:36.979 align:start position:0%
it's in there oh God you are so good
 
02:33:40.610 --> 02:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
I was anticipating your needs yeah thank
 
02:33:40.620 --> 02:33:41.990 align:start position:0%
I was anticipating your needs yeah thank
you

02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:33:44.690 --> 02:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to to break down and
 
02:33:46.309 --> 02:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
this I think may help and then we can
 
02:33:47.389 --> 02:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
get back to some of those other
 
02:33:47.399 --> 02:33:48.830 align:start position:0%
get back to some of those other
questions

02:33:48.830 --> 02:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:33:51.290 --> 02:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
um that our current we have four
 
02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
inpatient locked psychiatric units that
 
02:33:58.610 --> 02:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
are capable of serving 70 patients total
 
02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
currently we have three of those that
 
02:34:02.809 --> 02:34:02.819 align:start position:0%
are operational due to Staffing
 
02:34:02.819 --> 02:34:04.370 align:start position:0%
are operational due to Staffing
Resources

02:34:04.370 --> 02:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
Resources
 
02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
the total bed capacity on the three
 
02:34:09.770 --> 02:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
units is 55 patients and that is
 
02:34:11.990 --> 02:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
Staffing dependent if as long as we can
 
02:34:14.450 --> 02:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
have enough staff to safely manage the
 
02:34:14.460 --> 02:34:16.250 align:start position:0%
have enough staff to safely manage the
patients

02:34:16.250 --> 02:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:34:19.130 --> 02:34:19.140 align:start position:0%
um and then the current census today is
 
02:34:23.330 --> 02:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
45 and actually our current wait list is
 
02:34:23.340 --> 02:34:24.770 align:start position:0%
45 and actually our current wait list is
11

02:34:24.770 --> 02:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
11
 
02:34:27.050 --> 02:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
um patients today
 
02:34:30.410 --> 02:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
um so and of those I will I just want to
 
02:34:33.710 --> 02:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
point out that the the biggest barrier
 
02:34:36.170 --> 02:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
for for those to get in is really the
 
02:34:38.389 --> 02:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
need for single bedrooms
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
um so there are eight patients on our
 
02:34:42.410 --> 02:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
wait list that are requiring single
 
02:34:44.389 --> 02:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
rooms and so we have to wait for
 
02:34:46.130 --> 02:34:46.140 align:start position:0%
patients to leave from those single
 
02:34:47.870 --> 02:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
rooms for those other patients to come
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
in so how do you segregate the genders
 
02:34:53.809 --> 02:34:53.819 align:start position:0%
is it by uh Ward or is it by room
 
02:34:58.130 --> 02:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
it's by room yep so on each unit and
 
02:35:01.969 --> 02:35:01.979 align:start position:0%
we'll get into that on the next page
 
02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
um so in addition to those inpatient
 
02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
units we also have one residential level
 
02:35:08.750 --> 02:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
Care Unit
 
02:35:11.270 --> 02:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
um that will be the site of the level
 
02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
five psychiatric Residential Treatment
 
02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:14.870 align:start position:0%
five psychiatric Residential Treatment
Facility

02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
Facility
 
02:35:17.450 --> 02:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
and that those Renovations are going to
 
02:35:19.250 --> 02:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
be beginning very soon
 
02:35:21.349 --> 02:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
on the next page is where I break it all
 
02:35:24.170 --> 02:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
down for you yeah so we have our Madison
 
02:35:27.650 --> 02:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
unit that's a 15 bed unit it's currently
 
02:35:30.770 --> 02:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
vacant and it's vacant
 
02:35:33.770 --> 02:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
um we're waiting for Behavioral Health
 
02:35:37.790 --> 02:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
Furniture to be installed on that unit
 
02:35:41.990 --> 02:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
that unit was an adult unit and we only
 
02:35:45.410 --> 02:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
ever took voluntary adults so the
 
02:35:47.389 --> 02:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
environment needed to be made more
 
02:35:51.230 --> 02:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
secure and safe for the Child and
 
02:35:53.570 --> 02:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
Adolescent population different
 
02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
furniture that can't be thrown things
 
02:35:57.830 --> 02:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
like that
 
02:36:00.349 --> 02:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
um so that that unit is currently vacant
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
and then we're also need we would need
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
to increase and recruit more staff to be
 
02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
able to stand that unit back up
 
02:36:11.270 --> 02:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh the Lincoln unit that is our 23 bed
 
02:36:13.610 --> 02:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
Child and Adolescent unit and the ages
 
02:36:16.910 --> 02:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
on that unit are approximately 12 to 18.
 
02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
on the Pierce unit we can we have 16
 
02:36:24.469 --> 02:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
beds and that's ages 4 to 14.
 
02:36:27.410 --> 02:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
and then on the Washington unit we have
 
02:36:30.290 --> 02:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
that's our 16 bed unit and that is our
 
02:36:32.570 --> 02:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
young adult unit right now and that's
 
02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
ages 16 to 25.
 
02:36:38.809 --> 02:36:38.819 align:start position:0%
so maybe maybe I'm not uh
 
02:36:41.270 --> 02:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
typical but I I have a hard time
 
02:36:44.210 --> 02:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
imagining why a four or five-year-old
 
02:36:46.670 --> 02:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
would be in a residential facility can
 
02:36:48.590 --> 02:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
you can you kind of tell us a little bit
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
about the clinical presentation of a kid
 
02:36:53.389 --> 02:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
that that young that was yeah absolutely
 
02:36:55.910 --> 02:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
breaks our heart every time
 
02:36:57.830 --> 02:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
um but they are typically
 
02:37:00.070 --> 02:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
um patients that have
 
02:37:03.050 --> 02:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
suffered severe trauma
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
um have you know have been severely
 
02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:06.830 align:start position:0%
um have you know have been severely
abused

02:37:06.830 --> 02:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
abused
 
02:37:10.670 --> 02:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
um also parents are typically don't have
 
02:37:12.650 --> 02:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
the skills to be able to handle their
 
02:37:14.690 --> 02:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
behaviors that are a result of that
 
02:37:16.450 --> 02:37:16.460 align:start position:0%
trauma and abuse
 
02:37:19.969 --> 02:37:19.979 align:start position:0%
and in addition that young typically
 
02:37:21.910 --> 02:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that they may be
 
02:37:26.389 --> 02:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
cognitively delayed as well and maybe on
 
02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
the autism spectrum in addition to their
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
other behaviors or they may have some
 
02:37:36.650 --> 02:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities that require
 
02:37:40.610 --> 02:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
them to be under under
 
02:37:43.250 --> 02:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
current watch to be able to be trialled
 
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
on medications and behavior techniques
 
02:37:50.330 --> 02:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
we have on that unit we have Behavior
 
02:37:53.570 --> 02:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
analysts that particularly focus on that
 
02:37:56.570 --> 02:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
unit for those younger kids that really
 
02:37:59.150 --> 02:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
can work to develop a Behavior Support
 
02:38:02.030 --> 02:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
plan and determining the function of
 
02:38:04.610 --> 02:38:04.620 align:start position:0%
each of the behaviors
 
02:38:06.950 --> 02:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
so so this is horrible that's a horrible
 
02:38:11.450 --> 02:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
thing but um so um
 
02:38:13.210 --> 02:38:13.220 align:start position:0%
they're physical
 
02:38:17.090 --> 02:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
physiological status is it uh driven
 
02:38:22.490 --> 02:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
also because of maternal drug use are we
 
02:38:24.830 --> 02:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
talking about permanently impaired
 
02:38:27.830 --> 02:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
children and that we need to train to
 
02:38:31.370 --> 02:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
cope with their feelings sometimes
 
02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
we we you know it it varies
 
02:38:37.429 --> 02:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
um each presentation is is unique but
 
02:38:39.950 --> 02:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
that does happen more often than we
 
02:38:42.349 --> 02:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
would like to see it happen and you've
 
02:38:44.450 --> 02:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
got typical patient presentations I'm
 
02:38:47.570 --> 02:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
not seeing I see intent to harm but do
 
02:38:49.849 --> 02:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
you have the patients that have actually
 
02:38:53.570 --> 02:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
harmed and and are somewhat of a public
 
02:38:55.010 --> 02:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
safety risk
 
02:38:58.250 --> 02:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
we do yeah and that that's really these
 
02:39:00.410 --> 02:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
are the typical presentations of why
 
02:39:03.230 --> 02:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
they get through the door and if you
 
02:39:04.490 --> 02:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
think about
 
02:39:04.500 --> 02:39:05.210 align:start position:0%
think about
um

02:39:05.210 --> 02:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
the state of New of insurance these days
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
you have to present a significant
 
02:39:15.170 --> 02:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
imminent risk of harm to yourself or
 
02:39:18.530 --> 02:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
others to be able to be approved for
 
02:39:21.290 --> 02:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
hospitalization so they're typically
 
02:39:23.809 --> 02:39:23.819 align:start position:0%
these patients will be assaultive and
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
aggressive in school in the community to
 
02:39:29.030 --> 02:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
their families in addition because
 
02:39:31.250 --> 02:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's how they've learned to cope and
 
02:39:35.870 --> 02:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
and to get their needs met I I get that
 
02:39:38.809 --> 02:39:38.819 align:start position:0%
um so I I'm flipping through trying to
 
02:39:42.050 --> 02:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
anticipate my questions but or your
 
02:39:45.230 --> 02:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
answers but um but so I'm still looking
 
02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
for this uh security level designator
 
02:39:51.530 --> 02:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
and I don't see that in here so we do
 
02:39:53.570 --> 02:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
our they're all all of our units our
 
02:39:55.969 --> 02:39:55.979 align:start position:0%
inpatient units are locked they are
 
02:39:58.370 --> 02:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
locked units the patients all when they
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
are admitted to the hospital they are
 
02:40:05.450 --> 02:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
have no restriction no
 
02:40:05.460 --> 02:40:06.530 align:start position:0%
have no restriction no
no

02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:40:06.540 --> 02:40:07.250 align:start position:0%
no
um

02:40:07.250 --> 02:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:09.469 --> 02:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
what is the word
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
just went out of my head it's on the
 
02:40:16.969 --> 02:40:16.979 align:start position:0%
next slide it's it's not uh
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
privileges thank you so they have no
 
02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
privileges so they're restricted to the
 
02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:21.950 align:start position:0%
privileges so they're restricted to the
unit

02:40:21.950 --> 02:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
unit
 
02:40:24.590 --> 02:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
um until they are D met with their their
 
02:40:27.410 --> 02:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
treaters and decided that they can be
 
02:40:29.510 --> 02:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
off the unit with staff our patients are
 
02:40:32.030 --> 02:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
always with staff in that situation
 
02:40:36.110 --> 02:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
where we were the patient eloped they
 
02:40:39.349 --> 02:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
were actually out on the swing set being
 
02:40:41.090 --> 02:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
able because they had shown safe
 
02:40:43.969 --> 02:40:43.979 align:start position:0%
behaviors and then impulsively decided
 
02:40:48.170 --> 02:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
to to run so there is Security in place
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
with locks and then patients are with
 
02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
staff but it is not there's no fencing
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's no security around that we do
 
02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.010 align:start position:0%
there's no security around that we do
have

02:41:01.010 --> 02:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:41:05.870 --> 02:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
safety ambassadors that is our new
 
02:41:08.510 --> 02:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
roles that we have brought in since the
 
02:41:12.110 --> 02:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
state has come taken ownership and the
 
02:41:13.690 --> 02:41:13.700 align:start position:0%
safety Ambassador
 
02:41:17.570 --> 02:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
staff they actually are what in normal
 
02:41:20.330 --> 02:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
facilities would be for referred to as
 
02:41:20.340 --> 02:41:21.490 align:start position:0%
facilities would be for referred to as
security

02:41:21.490 --> 02:41:21.500 align:start position:0%
security
 
02:41:25.370 --> 02:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
but we really were not focusing on
 
02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
security and really wanting to focus on
 
02:41:30.190 --> 02:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
how it is that we can
 
02:41:32.929 --> 02:41:32.939 align:start position:0%
provide support for our staff have that
 
02:41:34.969 --> 02:41:34.979 align:start position:0%
additional support and resources but
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
still being trauma informed and people
 
02:41:41.090 --> 02:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
being understanding of the way that you
 
02:41:42.889 --> 02:41:42.899 align:start position:0%
have to approach a psychiatric patient
 
02:41:46.010 --> 02:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
so the actual metric for rating this
 
02:41:47.530 --> 02:41:47.540 align:start position:0%
secure level
 
02:41:51.410 --> 02:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
sununu is a five do you you don't know
 
02:41:53.630 --> 02:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
what your number is I think you probably
 
02:41:56.330 --> 02:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
have a number somewhere so within our
 
02:41:59.210 --> 02:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
system within the system of Care sununu
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
Center is a completely different and I
 
02:42:03.770 --> 02:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
can't really speak to that but within
 
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
the system of care the residential
 
02:42:09.530 --> 02:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
levels level five is the highest level
 
02:42:11.349 --> 02:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
for psychiatric
 
02:42:14.750 --> 02:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
for residential but we are one step
 
02:42:17.750 --> 02:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
above that that so in essence there
 
02:42:19.610 --> 02:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
isn't a level for it but inpatient
 
02:42:22.010 --> 02:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
psychiatric care if you wanted to give
 
02:42:25.309 --> 02:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
it a number would be a six hmm
 
02:42:27.950 --> 02:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
I misunderstood so you just taught me
 
02:42:30.050 --> 02:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
something I thought five was the highest
 
02:42:32.690 --> 02:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
from a just a security perspective and
 
02:42:35.150 --> 02:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
that the lower ones we may be speaking
 
02:42:38.150 --> 02:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
different yeah in different terms yeah
 
02:42:39.710 --> 02:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:42:41.690 --> 02:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
um so I've asked a lot of questions are
 
02:42:43.130 --> 02:42:43.140 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
02:42:46.490 --> 02:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
at this point any questions
 
02:42:50.330 --> 02:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
all right uh I I think I've asked all my
 
02:42:53.690 --> 02:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
questions so you now get to run wild
 
02:42:53.700 --> 02:42:56.150 align:start position:0%
questions so you now get to run wild
okay

02:42:56.150 --> 02:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:42:58.969 --> 02:42:58.979 align:start position:0%
the next uh slide actually goes into a
 
02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
little bit of detail about what our prtf
 
02:43:02.990 --> 02:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
the psychiatric residential treatment
 
02:43:06.349 --> 02:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
facility is going to look like that is
 
02:43:09.469 --> 02:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
on our Kennedy unit uh it will be a
 
02:43:12.410 --> 02:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
level five treatment facility one level
 
02:43:14.630 --> 02:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
below inpatient
 
02:43:17.450 --> 02:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
um it will be Children and adolescents
 
02:43:21.410 --> 02:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
and young adults ages 5 to 21 per CMS
 
02:43:25.670 --> 02:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
regulations that will be the um the
 
02:43:28.969 --> 02:43:28.979 align:start position:0%
age range that will be served served
 
02:43:33.170 --> 02:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
there it is a 12 bed capacity it's
 
02:43:35.469 --> 02:43:35.479 align:start position:0%
family driven youth guided
 
02:43:38.990 --> 02:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary train teams and then
 
02:43:41.570 --> 02:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
multiple treatment modalities will be
 
02:43:43.849 --> 02:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
put in place for their these children
 
02:43:47.389 --> 02:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
are there longer term so they actually
 
02:43:50.450 --> 02:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
will attend a full day of school that
 
02:43:53.570 --> 02:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
will be provided as opposed to on our
 
02:43:55.730 --> 02:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
inpatient we provide tutorial services
 
02:43:58.370 --> 02:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
for patients that are there longer than
 
02:44:00.170 --> 02:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
two weeks
 
02:44:02.929 --> 02:44:02.939 align:start position:0%
um so I lied because it's level five
 
02:44:04.429 --> 02:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
just triggered me
 
02:44:07.010 --> 02:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh I know that the commissioner
 
02:44:09.710 --> 02:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner shemene before she left one
 
02:44:11.150 --> 02:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
of her last things that she was trying
 
02:44:13.130 --> 02:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
to figure out was the worst case
 
02:44:15.530 --> 02:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
scenario if they had to close the sununu
 
02:44:18.410 --> 02:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
center well where would they uh outplace
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
those uh those kids and I'm seeing that
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
you have a level five treatment facility
 
02:44:28.610 --> 02:44:28.620 align:start position:0%
here I'm I'm wondering the extent to
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
which in the worst case scenario you
 
02:44:33.889 --> 02:44:33.899 align:start position:0%
could or could not or shouldn't or
 
02:44:35.410 --> 02:44:35.420 align:start position:0%
should not
 
02:44:39.290 --> 02:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
receive kids from sununu and to the
 
02:44:42.050 --> 02:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
Kennedy unit or another unit
 
02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:43.309 align:start position:0%
Kennedy unit or another unit
uh

02:44:43.309 --> 02:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:44:46.010 --> 02:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
we we do take patients
 
02:44:48.410 --> 02:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
um from that are in acute psychiatric
 
02:44:50.630 --> 02:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
need the perimeters around what
 
02:44:53.750 --> 02:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
qualifies for a psychiatric Residential
 
02:44:56.690 --> 02:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
Treatment level of care level five is
 
02:44:58.750 --> 02:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
different than a security
 
02:45:03.590 --> 02:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
potential level five so through the cat
 
02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
assessment that's where their level of
 
02:45:09.410 --> 02:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
need gets determined so that if they do
 
02:45:11.809 --> 02:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
have a need for a level five placement
 
02:45:14.330 --> 02:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
they could be referred to to our
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
facility for for that level of care
 
02:45:20.389 --> 02:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
okay so then the next half of that
 
02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
question was to the extent that you had
 
02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to Think Through It
 
02:45:28.849 --> 02:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
is the Kennedy unit potentially a place
 
02:45:31.969 --> 02:45:31.979 align:start position:0%
where if we had to we could outplace
 
02:45:34.309 --> 02:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
sununu residents
 
02:45:36.590 --> 02:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
I I don't really have that information
 
02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to I I wouldn't know their
 
02:45:41.690 --> 02:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
presentations so I don't know because
 
02:45:44.690 --> 02:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
it's really around meeting the criteria
 
02:45:46.849 --> 02:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
for the psychiatric residential level
 
02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's why it's trauma informed and not
 
02:45:52.670 --> 02:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
physical security informed right
 
02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:55.309 align:start position:0%
physical security informed right
okay

02:45:55.309 --> 02:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:58.490 --> 02:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:01.550 --> 02:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
questions I think you're good okay
 
02:46:03.230 --> 02:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:46:06.590 --> 02:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
and then the next slide uh just really
 
02:46:08.450 --> 02:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
gives you just a breakdown of the
 
02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
services that we offer at Hampstead and
 
02:46:13.550 --> 02:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
what it is that that we do
 
02:46:15.469 --> 02:46:15.479 align:start position:0%
I don't really know that you need me to
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
go through all of these things
 
02:46:19.610 --> 02:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
um it really is just to give you a
 
02:46:21.830 --> 02:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of insight in case you're
 
02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
wondering hey can we handle some of
 
02:46:25.730 --> 02:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
those kids that may not meet these
 
02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
criteria but this this is really the
 
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
outline of the types of services that we
 
02:46:33.290 --> 02:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
do we do psychiatric assessment and
 
02:46:37.309 --> 02:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
medication evaluation inpatient teach
 
02:46:40.429 --> 02:46:40.439 align:start position:0%
them coping skills to help to develop
 
02:46:44.090 --> 02:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
safety plans and then get them back into
 
02:46:46.190 --> 02:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
their Community because that really is
 
02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
our number one goal is to be able to get
 
02:46:51.530 --> 02:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
them back with their families or back in
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
a community setting where they can go
 
02:46:57.889 --> 02:46:57.899 align:start position:0%
back to having somewhat normal lives
 
02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
so tell me about the continuity care
 
02:47:02.570 --> 02:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
when they leave your facility how do you
 
02:47:05.150 --> 02:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
help make sure that there's or or to or
 
02:47:08.270 --> 02:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
or or at least aware of the extent to
 
02:47:09.770 --> 02:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
which they're successfully trans
 
02:47:11.870 --> 02:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
transitioning back into their Community
 
02:47:15.050 --> 02:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
yeah we have a stellar social work
 
02:47:18.530 --> 02:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
department that actually does an amazing
 
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
job with setting up Aftercare that's the
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
Aftercare Begins the day that the
 
02:47:25.910 --> 02:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
patient is admitted they will begin
 
02:47:27.950 --> 02:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
planning for that discharge with
 
02:47:30.770 --> 02:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
figuring out what they already have for
 
02:47:34.849 --> 02:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
services in place what's needed if there
 
02:47:36.830 --> 02:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
are gaps in services
 
02:47:39.170 --> 02:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
again we go back to those weekly
 
02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
meetings that they participate in to be
 
02:47:44.450 --> 02:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
able to actually talk about the needs of
 
02:47:47.210 --> 02:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
individual patients if we have a home a
 
02:47:49.610 --> 02:47:49.620 align:start position:0%
child that's in a homeless situation you
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
know will involve different departments
 
02:47:53.929 --> 02:47:53.939 align:start position:0%
to say Hey you know we have this child
 
02:47:55.849 --> 02:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
he's going to go back out into the
 
02:47:57.290 --> 02:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
community with his family that's
 
02:47:59.210 --> 02:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
homeless what can we do what things can
 
02:48:00.710 --> 02:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
we put in place
 
02:48:03.830 --> 02:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
so they set all of that up prior to
 
02:48:06.530 --> 02:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
discharge and when the patient is ready
 
02:48:08.690 --> 02:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
for discharge that's all reviewed with
 
02:48:10.969 --> 02:48:10.979 align:start position:0%
the families and every patient that
 
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
leaves our facility is set up with
 
02:48:16.370 --> 02:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
Aftercare appointments with their first
 
02:48:21.410 --> 02:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
appointment set for their their needs
 
02:48:21.420 --> 02:48:23.889 align:start position:0%
appointment set for their their needs
foreign

02:48:23.889 --> 02:48:23.899 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:48:26.990 --> 02:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
do you do you leverage any uh
 
02:48:29.690 --> 02:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
telemedicine or Telehealth to establish
 
02:48:32.809 --> 02:48:32.819 align:start position:0%
a connection between the patient and and
 
02:48:34.670 --> 02:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
back into the community prior to
 
02:48:36.410 --> 02:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
discharge do you have any tell
 
02:48:39.889 --> 02:48:39.899 align:start position:0%
telemedicine capability as part of your
 
02:48:42.889 --> 02:48:42.899 align:start position:0%
no we don't okay
 
02:48:45.290 --> 02:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:48:48.170 --> 02:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:48:48.180 --> 02:48:50.510 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
question

02:48:50.510 --> 02:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:48:51.889 --> 02:48:51.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:55.130 --> 02:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
um I know in in some adult care settings
 
02:48:57.830 --> 02:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
you can have a program that's like a day
 
02:49:01.429 --> 02:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
program is that a model that has ever
 
02:49:03.889 --> 02:49:03.899 align:start position:0%
been used for youth or is that not seen
 
02:49:05.690 --> 02:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
as a good I just think of it as a way to
 
02:49:07.010 --> 02:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
have them with their family but still
 
02:49:09.650 --> 02:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
receiving that full day of treatment
 
02:49:13.010 --> 02:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
and it is and you just caught me I did
 
02:49:14.990 --> 02:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
not prepare that piece because we
 
02:49:17.570 --> 02:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
actually do have stepped down
 
02:49:20.650 --> 02:49:20.660 align:start position:0%
um partial hospitalization for our
 
02:49:23.809 --> 02:49:23.819 align:start position:0%
patients that are leaving inpatient we
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
have the ability to step them down to
 
02:49:29.090 --> 02:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
partial if it's appropriate for them and
 
02:49:32.389 --> 02:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
we do utilize it quite often we also
 
02:49:35.090 --> 02:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
will accept previously admitted patients
 
02:49:37.429 --> 02:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
into our partial hospitalization program
 
02:49:40.490 --> 02:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
because we already will know them and if
 
02:49:42.170 --> 02:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily need that
 
02:49:44.809 --> 02:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
overnight care and they have supports at
 
02:49:46.370 --> 02:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
home we can do that
 
02:49:49.610 --> 02:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
um in addition so I will make sure to
 
02:49:53.389 --> 02:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
add that the next time into my slides
 
02:49:55.490 --> 02:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
the question representative thank you Mr
 
02:49:56.630 --> 02:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't think you've covered
 
02:49:58.429 --> 02:49:58.439 align:start position:0%
this yet but what is the the average
 
02:50:03.170 --> 02:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
duration of a stay for your patients and
 
02:50:06.410 --> 02:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
could that further be broken down by age
 
02:50:09.830 --> 02:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
for example um you gave a breakdown of 4
 
02:50:12.650 --> 02:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
to 17 18 to 25 year olds is there an
 
02:50:15.950 --> 02:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
average for the age range on how long
 
02:50:19.429 --> 02:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
they stay Thank you absolutely so our
 
02:50:22.969 --> 02:50:22.979 align:start position:0%
average length of stay for the
 
02:50:29.830 --> 02:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:33.650 --> 02:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
the younger patients because it tends to
 
02:50:36.170 --> 02:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
be a little bit more complicated and
 
02:50:38.750 --> 02:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
then also with really doing a lot more
 
02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
around the family
 
02:50:43.730 --> 02:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
um training and things like that their
 
02:50:45.530 --> 02:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
average length of stay typically is
 
02:50:48.349 --> 02:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
around 10 to 14 days
 
02:50:52.010 --> 02:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
and then on our young adult unit the
 
02:50:55.550 --> 02:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
average length of stay is typically also
 
02:50:58.429 --> 02:50:58.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's closer to that seven to eight
 
02:51:00.230 --> 02:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
day range
 
02:51:04.570 --> 02:51:04.580 align:start position:0%
what I will tell you is that we do have
 
02:51:07.429 --> 02:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
longer lengths of stay
 
02:51:10.010 --> 02:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
awaiting placement things like of that
 
02:51:13.309 --> 02:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
nature but we also have shorter lengths
 
02:51:15.050 --> 02:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
of stay so those really are around the
 
02:51:15.060 --> 02:51:19.490 align:start position:0%
of stay so those really are around the
averages

02:51:19.490 --> 02:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:23.349 --> 02:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
so I'm I I think I'm um
 
02:51:27.710 --> 02:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
stereotyping a typical model of having a
 
02:51:30.110 --> 02:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
parent or a guardian at home and and
 
02:51:32.450 --> 02:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
some sort of family support environment
 
02:51:37.550 --> 02:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
to help discharge the patient back into
 
02:51:40.030 --> 02:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to make sure I understand
 
02:51:42.830 --> 02:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
the worst case scenarios around all of
 
02:51:45.050 --> 02:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
that you know there are probably some
 
02:51:48.290 --> 02:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
kids that really ought not to go back
 
02:51:51.469 --> 02:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
into their home setting uh for multiple
 
02:51:55.550 --> 02:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
reasons or they just don't have a
 
02:51:58.910 --> 02:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
competent a potentially competent adult
 
02:52:03.050 --> 02:52:03.060 align:start position:0%
support network What What In Those edge
 
02:52:06.190 --> 02:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
cases where there isn't a stable home
 
02:52:09.469 --> 02:52:09.479 align:start position:0%
what what do what do we find ourselves
 
02:52:12.050 --> 02:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
needing to do to make sure that we don't
 
02:52:15.710 --> 02:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
put a kid back into a bad situation or a
 
02:52:17.990 --> 02:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
situation that's just not going to be
 
02:52:21.110 --> 02:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
productive oh absolutely and again that
 
02:52:23.150 --> 02:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
happens more often than we we like to
 
02:52:24.650 --> 02:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
see it as well
 
02:52:28.429 --> 02:52:28.439 align:start position:0%
um but in those situations it really is
 
02:52:31.870 --> 02:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
um a great collaborative effort between
 
02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
dcyf Children's Bureau
 
02:52:37.490 --> 02:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
where we're trying to figure out and
 
02:52:39.530 --> 02:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
that cat assessment again comes back
 
02:52:42.110 --> 02:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
into play to determine do they need
 
02:52:44.030 --> 02:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
residential level of care do they need
 
02:52:47.150 --> 02:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
Therapeutic Foster home what is it
 
02:52:49.790 --> 02:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
really that that they need
 
02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
and then we attempt to get that for them
 
02:52:55.790 --> 02:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
so we have critical shortages in
 
02:52:57.650 --> 02:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
Therapeutic Foster Homes right we don't
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
have people ready to fill that whole
 
02:53:03.230 --> 02:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
need so so if that's what they need then
 
02:53:06.290 --> 02:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
what are we doing we're continuing to to
 
02:53:09.050 --> 02:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
work with in the system to try to find
 
02:53:12.410 --> 02:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
the least restrictive environment for
 
02:53:15.769 --> 02:53:15.779 align:start position:0%
these children on a day-to-day basis we
 
02:53:19.370 --> 02:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
currently have nine children that are
 
02:53:21.290 --> 02:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
awaiting placement that have been with
 
02:53:24.349 --> 02:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
us a significant amount of time we will
 
02:53:26.450 --> 02:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
never send our patients
 
02:53:30.110 --> 02:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
um out in you know back into a difficult
 
02:53:33.110 --> 02:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
situation if they if they really need to
 
02:53:35.450 --> 02:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
be somewhere safe and secure
 
02:53:37.969 --> 02:53:37.979 align:start position:0%
so when they're in that kind of holding
 
02:53:41.929 --> 02:53:41.939 align:start position:0%
waiting status are they still considered
 
02:53:44.870 --> 02:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
to go against your average wait time or
 
02:53:48.530 --> 02:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
your average uh length of care time or
 
02:53:50.809 --> 02:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
are they in a different status they're
 
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
they're in a different category
 
02:53:55.490 --> 02:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
okay and you just said you had nine of
 
02:53:58.150 --> 02:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
those and and those can take
 
02:54:01.490 --> 02:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
months potentially right
 
02:54:05.210 --> 02:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
okay so so so how often do you have a
 
02:54:06.889 --> 02:54:06.899 align:start position:0%
child that there's just nowhere for them
 
02:54:08.150 --> 02:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
to go home
 
02:54:11.150 --> 02:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
that we don't have a Therapeutic Foster
 
02:54:13.370 --> 02:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
Care for that we're still needing to
 
02:54:16.120 --> 02:54:16.130 align:start position:0%
manage inside your facility
 
02:54:16.130 --> 02:54:16.610 align:start position:0%
manage inside your facility
[Music]

02:54:16.610 --> 02:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:54:16.620 --> 02:54:18.050 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:54:18.050 --> 02:54:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
on the regular we have that at least you
 
02:54:23.090 --> 02:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
know on a weekly basis where there are
 
02:54:25.550 --> 02:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
our children that are still waiting for
 
02:54:29.269 --> 02:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
for other other placements that are are
 
02:54:31.910 --> 02:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
stable and with us yeah so so you're
 
02:54:34.130 --> 02:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
really serving a very vital safety net
 
02:54:36.710 --> 02:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
feature you're not you're not just part
 
02:54:40.070 --> 02:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the the workflow the clinical flow
 
02:54:43.969 --> 02:54:43.979 align:start position:0%
you're also a significant safety net to
 
02:54:46.190 --> 02:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that those that are not
 
02:54:49.130 --> 02:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
flowing through our system still have
 
02:54:51.170 --> 02:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
provision of care
 
02:54:54.230 --> 02:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
correct I don't think I see that slide
 
02:54:55.750 --> 02:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
though sorry
 
02:54:59.210 --> 02:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
but okay we're hoping to fix that part
 
02:55:01.250 --> 02:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
of the system right well you know I I
 
02:55:03.530 --> 02:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
was I sat in on the Hampstead uh
 
02:55:06.050 --> 02:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
briefings last year but it was just so
 
02:55:07.370 --> 02:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
um kind of the whole thing was so
 
02:55:09.469 --> 02:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
overwhelming I never really got a deep
 
02:55:11.870 --> 02:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
feel for what you guys see so I really
 
02:55:13.730 --> 02:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you're what you're
 
02:55:15.170 --> 02:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
sharing with us today
 
02:55:17.150 --> 02:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
um so are there questions for
 
02:55:28.130 --> 02:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:30.349 --> 02:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
I don't have that number with me I'm
 
02:55:32.210 --> 02:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
sorry I know
 
02:55:32.220 --> 02:55:33.110 align:start position:0%
sorry I know
um

02:55:33.110 --> 02:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:35.150 --> 02:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
I I really I don't I don't want to give
 
02:55:36.710 --> 02:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
you an incorrect number but I could
 
02:55:39.050 --> 02:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
certainly get that back to you I'd be
 
02:55:41.210 --> 02:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
interested to see how many children are
 
02:55:43.910 --> 02:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
actually going through that so that's
 
02:55:46.070 --> 02:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
contacts you're looking for total and
 
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
unique contacts yes the total number of
 
02:55:51.410 --> 02:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
children that they actually feels like
 
02:55:54.650 --> 02:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
it's easily over 250 but I'd be
 
02:55:55.969 --> 02:55:55.979 align:start position:0%
interested in that number
 
02:55:58.730 --> 02:55:58.740 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely I mean I know our our
 
02:56:02.269 --> 02:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
patient days are are well over you know
 
02:56:05.030 --> 02:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
a thousand per per month so
 
02:56:07.490 --> 02:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
great thank you yeah I will get that
 
02:56:10.910 --> 02:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
back to you representative Northern
 
02:56:16.730 --> 02:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:19.130 --> 02:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
children that go home and then end up
 
02:56:22.429 --> 02:56:22.439 align:start position:0%
coming back for various reasons yep our
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
annualized readmission rate is
 
02:56:28.010 --> 02:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
um four percent our readmission rates
 
02:56:30.650 --> 02:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
this past month was two percent okay
 
02:56:34.730 --> 02:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:37.130 --> 02:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other questions you can
 
02:56:40.670 --> 02:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
continue if you'd like excellent so as
 
02:56:43.910 --> 02:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
you move forward you can see our slides
 
02:56:47.510 --> 02:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
that include our average Staffing filled
 
02:56:50.809 --> 02:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
rates versus vacancy rates
 
02:56:53.269 --> 02:56:53.279 align:start position:0%
um these these are our filled rates
 
02:56:55.190 --> 02:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
um so you can see that we've had a
 
02:56:57.349 --> 02:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
pretty volatile time but what this shows
 
02:57:01.010 --> 02:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
is really there was the um the state
 
02:57:04.190 --> 02:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
assisted Hampstead Hospital even before
 
02:57:07.010 --> 02:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
by trying to get the children out of the
 
02:57:10.670 --> 02:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
the uh emergency departments and into
 
02:57:13.570 --> 02:57:13.580 align:start position:0%
our beds they assisted with the maximum
 
02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
contract for the strike force team and
 
02:57:21.769 --> 02:57:21.779 align:start position:0%
that was went through July
 
02:57:25.490 --> 02:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
um and into August so then we start to
 
02:57:28.130 --> 02:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
improve and you can see through we were
 
02:57:31.910 --> 02:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
using a lot of agency Staffing as well
 
02:57:35.269 --> 02:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
as folks that were that well path
 
02:57:38.870 --> 02:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
Recovery Solutions Had cover
 
02:57:42.170 --> 02:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
um from other areas during this time and
 
02:57:45.590 --> 02:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
then once we hit the holiday period and
 
02:57:49.790 --> 02:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
time we saw a lot of turnover with folks
 
02:57:53.870 --> 02:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
that didn't want to work on holidays and
 
02:57:57.110 --> 02:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
we're we're leaving and now the
 
02:57:58.910 --> 02:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
workforce we were not seeing very many
 
02:58:01.150 --> 02:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
applicants at that point
 
02:58:04.070 --> 02:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
as you can see in January things have
 
02:58:06.790 --> 02:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
improved and increased
 
02:58:09.190 --> 02:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
and we are now
 
02:58:12.230 --> 02:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
at that level where where I explained
 
02:58:13.910 --> 02:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
where we're going to be able to keep
 
02:58:15.730 --> 02:58:15.740 align:start position:0%
those numbers up
 
02:58:18.410 --> 02:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
significantly and we are feeling pretty
 
02:58:20.630 --> 02:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
confident in our ability to continue to
 
02:58:23.809 --> 02:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
increase that overtime so what happened
 
02:58:27.530 --> 02:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
why why are I I I see the data yeah but
 
02:58:29.330 --> 02:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
what's what's underlying the data what
 
02:58:29.340 --> 02:58:31.250 align:start position:0%
what's what's underlying the data what
happened

02:58:31.250 --> 02:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
happened
 
02:58:31.260 --> 02:58:32.870 align:start position:0%
happened
applicants

02:58:32.870 --> 02:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
02:58:35.210 --> 02:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
they they're applicants
 
02:58:37.849 --> 02:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
um and now the holiday season has passed
 
02:58:40.370 --> 02:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
and people are back out looking for the
 
02:58:42.830 --> 02:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
workforce we typically will see that we
 
02:58:44.809 --> 02:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
don't have a whole lot of applicants
 
02:58:47.570 --> 02:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
around the holiday time people don't
 
02:58:49.849 --> 02:58:49.859 align:start position:0%
want to start a new job and then people
 
02:58:51.170 --> 02:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
leave because they don't want to work
 
02:58:52.910 --> 02:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
the holidays
 
02:58:54.769 --> 02:58:54.779 align:start position:0%
um and then we start to see the
 
02:58:56.630 --> 02:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year folks will again
 
02:58:58.610 --> 02:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
be looking for work
 
02:59:00.950 --> 02:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
oh so we just need to saddle everyone
 
02:59:03.830 --> 02:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
with a Christmas bill and we can fix our
 
02:59:06.230 --> 02:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
stacking problem wouldn't that be nice
 
02:59:08.330 --> 02:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
uh representative Waller
 
02:59:10.849 --> 02:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
so when I'm looking at this chart
 
02:59:13.429 --> 02:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
I see that you had a really big drop off
 
02:59:17.570 --> 02:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
a nurse your counselors seem to stay
 
02:59:19.370 --> 02:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
about the same
 
02:59:21.710 --> 02:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
but the nurses really have dropped
 
02:59:23.450 --> 02:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
really dropped off and you're trying to
 
02:59:25.130 --> 02:59:25.140 align:start position:0%
build back up but it's still much lower
 
02:59:26.990 --> 02:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
than you have had
 
02:59:29.330 --> 02:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
are you feeling competition for the
 
02:59:32.090 --> 02:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
nurses with the hospitals and other
 
02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
health care facilities that are
 
02:59:37.269 --> 02:59:37.279 align:start position:0%
providing bonuses and retention
 
02:59:40.370 --> 02:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
incentives yes and that's something that
 
02:59:42.889 --> 02:59:42.899 align:start position:0%
we also have been looking at with well
 
02:59:45.010 --> 02:59:45.020 align:start position:0%
path Recovery Solutions
 
02:59:48.710 --> 02:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
we meet bi-weekly to actually discuss
 
02:59:50.870 --> 02:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
those those Innovations and really
 
02:59:54.230 --> 02:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
trying to increase those we we are
 
02:59:56.809 --> 02:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
offering bonuses to try to attract
 
02:59:59.630 --> 02:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
people and as we instituted that you'll
 
03:00:02.210 --> 03:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
see that that's really kind of where we
 
03:00:04.389 --> 03:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
started to be able to see some of the
 
03:00:07.750 --> 03:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
increase in those as well thank you
 
03:00:11.389 --> 03:00:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:18.830 --> 03:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:20.750 --> 03:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
what about how to fill in their Staffing
 
03:00:23.990 --> 03:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
that that's exactly why you can see in
 
03:00:28.429 --> 03:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
October we had such a a high number of
 
03:00:31.790 --> 03:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
nurses is we were really using those
 
03:00:34.969 --> 03:00:34.979 align:start position:0%
agency nurses and I know Sean will be
 
03:00:37.490 --> 03:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
speaking more to that because it's very
 
03:00:39.370 --> 03:00:39.380 align:start position:0%
very expensive
 
03:00:42.650 --> 03:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
and so really looking at that and it's
 
03:00:44.690 --> 03:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
it's nice I don't want to steal your
 
03:00:47.030 --> 03:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
thunder Sean but it's it's nice that
 
03:00:50.690 --> 03:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
these numbers here are representative of
 
03:00:52.849 --> 03:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
nurses that we have been able to
 
03:00:57.170 --> 03:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
actually hire on now and we do we have
 
03:01:00.769 --> 03:01:00.779 align:start position:0%
our last agency nurses that are going to
 
03:01:07.490 --> 03:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:10.130 --> 03:01:10.140 align:start position:0%
all right okay okay
 
03:01:14.330 --> 03:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
the next slide is just an X by a picture
 
03:01:16.849 --> 03:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
of what our admissions and discharge
 
03:01:19.910 --> 03:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
averages are over the different months
 
03:01:25.190 --> 03:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
and what you'll see here is when we took
 
03:01:28.010 --> 03:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
uh the state took over in June
 
03:01:30.469 --> 03:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
we had more discharges than admissions
 
03:01:32.630 --> 03:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
really what we wanted to be able to see
 
03:01:34.610 --> 03:01:34.620 align:start position:0%
is what we're starting to be able to see
 
03:01:38.230 --> 03:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
in January now with the admissions
 
03:01:41.750 --> 03:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
outweighing the discharges we wanted to
 
03:01:43.790 --> 03:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
be able to increase and increase those
 
03:01:47.030 --> 03:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
bed capacities and we also wanted to be
 
03:01:49.130 --> 03:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
sure that we were at least admitting at
 
03:01:52.849 --> 03:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
the same rate as discharging patients as
 
03:01:52.859 --> 03:01:54.650 align:start position:0%
the same rate as discharging patients as
well

03:01:54.650 --> 03:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:01:57.469 --> 03:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like I'd like to tell you the
 
03:01:58.969 --> 03:01:58.979 align:start position:0%
story that I have in my head about
 
03:02:01.130 --> 03:02:01.140 align:start position:0%
Hampstead and then you could I'm asking
 
03:02:02.510 --> 03:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
you to correct it
 
03:02:05.809 --> 03:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
um that Hamstead before the state
 
03:02:08.929 --> 03:02:08.939 align:start position:0%
acquired it was an ongoing viable
 
03:02:12.349 --> 03:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
concern they they had their patient mix
 
03:02:15.230 --> 03:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
and the revenues and the expenses they
 
03:02:17.870 --> 03:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
were they were essentially uh at least
 
03:02:19.969 --> 03:02:19.979 align:start position:0%
in a break even if it not a profitable
 
03:02:22.429 --> 03:02:22.439 align:start position:0%
situation and then the the state has
 
03:02:27.429 --> 03:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
come in uh and and we're basically
 
03:02:30.170 --> 03:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
adding some capacity with some State
 
03:02:33.469 --> 03:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
money and but but but I but I think the
 
03:02:36.110 --> 03:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
principle was that we were going to
 
03:02:38.710 --> 03:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
continue to try to run Hampstead
 
03:02:41.030 --> 03:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
predominantly like
 
03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:42.110 align:start position:0%
predominantly like
um

03:02:42.110 --> 03:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:44.630 --> 03:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
and so it had a for-profit component
 
03:02:46.670 --> 03:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
then you know certainly at least you
 
03:02:51.530 --> 03:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
know pay pay your way and and that so
 
03:02:51.540 --> 03:02:53.030 align:start position:0%
know pay pay your way and and that so
far

03:02:53.030 --> 03:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
far
 
03:02:55.429 --> 03:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
um you all seem like you're in a good
 
03:02:57.710 --> 03:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
position to do that as I'm looking at
 
03:03:00.469 --> 03:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
the the admissions and discharges and
 
03:03:03.469 --> 03:03:03.479 align:start position:0%
the and the shortage of the census I'm
 
03:03:05.510 --> 03:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm just wondering what you can
 
03:03:08.269 --> 03:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
tell us publicly about
 
03:03:11.210 --> 03:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
um the Financial Health of Hampstead and
 
03:03:13.730 --> 03:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
the ongoing viability of the business
 
03:03:15.950 --> 03:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
model as you understand it and and
 
03:03:17.990 --> 03:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
please correct me on the business model
 
03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
because that was not accurate
 
03:03:24.590 --> 03:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
that no um that is is exactly Hampstead
 
03:03:27.290 --> 03:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
was Hampstead Outlook Hampstead Hospital
 
03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
as it was before was a for-profit
 
03:03:34.429 --> 03:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
um and that that was true we were barely
 
03:03:37.309 --> 03:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
Break Even but that was you know in
 
03:03:41.090 --> 03:03:41.100 align:start position:0%
relation to all kinds of varying effects
 
03:03:44.090 --> 03:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
now that the state has taken over
 
03:03:47.389 --> 03:03:47.399 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna let Sean the CFO have this
 
03:03:49.790 --> 03:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
conversation because we've managed to go
 
03:03:52.309 --> 03:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
right to his section now and he can fill
 
03:03:56.150 --> 03:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:58.490 --> 03:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
so yeah just in regards to to that
 
03:04:00.710 --> 03:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
question in particular
 
03:04:03.769 --> 03:04:03.779 align:start position:0%
um I think now with census being low we
 
03:04:07.130 --> 03:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
also have had lower Staffing levels so
 
03:04:10.670 --> 03:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
it is more or less aligned to you know
 
03:04:13.070 --> 03:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
our vacancies our meeting what our
 
03:04:16.849 --> 03:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
census can can facilitate so
 
03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
um we are currently in a
 
03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:20.809 align:start position:0%
um we are currently in a
um

03:04:20.809 --> 03:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:24.170 --> 03:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
an okay position financially but again
 
03:04:26.510 --> 03:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
with the new hires coming on we're going
 
03:04:28.010 --> 03:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
to have added expenses to which we're
 
03:04:30.110 --> 03:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
going to be building census uh forward
 
03:04:32.210 --> 03:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
and building it up in addition to the
 
03:04:35.030 --> 03:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
prtf coming on so we should be in a in a
 
03:04:36.710 --> 03:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
better spot
 
03:04:39.050 --> 03:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
um as time goes on
 
03:04:40.910 --> 03:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
um but the
 
03:04:42.830 --> 03:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
um our revenues and expenses yeah
 
03:04:44.690 --> 03:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
they're they're pretty
 
03:04:44.700 --> 03:04:45.469 align:start position:0%
they're they're pretty
um

03:04:45.469 --> 03:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:48.170 --> 03:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
our expenses are are matching more or
 
03:04:50.510 --> 03:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
less what our census is at and our
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:56.630 --> 03:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
so so if that was all running you know
 
03:04:59.510 --> 03:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
perfectly and that described 100 of the
 
03:05:02.150 --> 03:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
operations yeah the theory is you
 
03:05:04.130 --> 03:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need any augmentation of
 
03:05:06.190 --> 03:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
03:05:09.530 --> 03:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
and and I and so I'm just looking to
 
03:05:13.070 --> 03:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
validate if that's a a bad way of me
 
03:05:16.790 --> 03:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
viewing it or inaccurate So currently
 
03:05:19.190 --> 03:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
right now we have
 
03:05:23.389 --> 03:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
um arpa funds that are funding Us in
 
03:05:27.769 --> 03:05:27.779 align:start position:0%
addition to our Medicaid dish funds
 
03:05:31.190 --> 03:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
um and then our agency income so the
 
03:05:33.650 --> 03:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
arpa funds will not be available in the
 
03:05:35.690 --> 03:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
coming years
 
03:05:39.530 --> 03:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
um which will create uh discrepancy or a
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
hole in the budget to where General
 
03:05:44.570 --> 03:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
funds may be needed right and I I had
 
03:05:46.309 --> 03:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
promised Mr White that we weren't going
 
03:05:48.530 --> 03:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
to talk numbers so so far I'm just
 
03:05:50.870 --> 03:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
talking subjective Theory descriptive
 
03:05:53.389 --> 03:05:53.399 align:start position:0%
stuff and not numbers but I'm just
 
03:05:57.590 --> 03:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
trying to get a my mindset on on the
 
03:06:02.330 --> 03:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
extent to which there may be a hole that
 
03:06:04.490 --> 03:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
General funds are going to need to fill
 
03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
did you want to say something Mr White
 
03:06:11.150 --> 03:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
I I I'm just looking for just a little
 
03:06:13.370 --> 03:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
context here on on where we're going
 
03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
with state requirements yeah sure so um
 
03:06:18.769 --> 03:06:18.779 align:start position:0%
you you'll see as Sean alluded to
 
03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
already in our agency budget we did
 
03:06:23.630 --> 03:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
include a certain assumed uh patient
 
03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue amount and other funds um as
 
03:06:27.349 --> 03:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
well as a nine million dollar general
 
03:06:29.389 --> 03:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
fund prioritized need in our efficiency
 
03:06:29.399 --> 03:06:30.410 align:start position:0%
fund prioritized need in our efficiency
budget

03:06:30.410 --> 03:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:06:32.450 --> 03:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that we did that is
 
03:06:34.990 --> 03:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
that we don't really have a good history
 
03:06:38.330 --> 03:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
for what the patient revenues and what
 
03:06:40.610 --> 03:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
the what what the Staffing expenses will
 
03:06:43.190 --> 03:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
be as we continue to ramp up so we
 
03:06:46.010 --> 03:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
intentionally try to incorporate a
 
03:06:48.170 --> 03:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
buffer there to address that scenario
 
03:06:49.849 --> 03:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
because we do have a different operating
 
03:06:53.570 --> 03:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
model than Hampstead Outlook Inc did and
 
03:06:55.610 --> 03:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
and because of that we can't necessarily
 
03:06:57.050 --> 03:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
look back and say well these were their
 
03:06:59.150 --> 03:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
expenses these were their revenues let's
 
03:07:00.889 --> 03:07:00.899 align:start position:0%
base our new projections on that because
 
03:07:03.710 --> 03:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
we've we've we're the state we're
 
03:07:03.720 --> 03:07:04.910 align:start position:0%
we've we've we're the state we're
different

03:07:04.910 --> 03:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:07:07.130 --> 03:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
um and and we also have this this public
 
03:07:09.889 --> 03:07:09.899 align:start position:0%
partner private uh excuse me this
 
03:07:12.050 --> 03:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
public-private partnership with with
 
03:07:15.230 --> 03:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
wellpath to help facilitate and and be
 
03:07:17.570 --> 03:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
part of the executive team
 
03:07:18.950 --> 03:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and and facilitate the daily
 
03:07:21.410 --> 03:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
operations there so at this point in
 
03:07:23.210 --> 03:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
time Sean and I have had conversations
 
03:07:26.510 --> 03:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
about this about trying to
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
as we enter the house and the Senate
 
03:07:30.769 --> 03:07:30.779 align:start position:0%
phase have more accurate projections for
 
03:07:32.929 --> 03:07:32.939 align:start position:0%
what that real need will be in the long
 
03:07:32.939 --> 03:07:33.710 align:start position:0%
what that real need will be in the long
run

03:07:33.710 --> 03:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
run
 
03:07:36.889 --> 03:07:36.899 align:start position:0%
so okay so I'm just to stay out of the
 
03:07:39.469 --> 03:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
conceptual level you use the term buffer
 
03:07:42.290 --> 03:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
okay the way I think of a buffer is that
 
03:07:43.969 --> 03:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
you're going through a transition you're
 
03:07:45.710 --> 03:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
getting new data you're getting new
 
03:07:47.809 --> 03:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
ideas about what the operating model is
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
going to do and because of that
 
03:07:51.170 --> 03:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
transition and the uncertainty
 
03:07:53.269 --> 03:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
associated with it you would have a
 
03:07:56.269 --> 03:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
financial pad that could buffer the
 
03:07:58.730 --> 03:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
uncertainty of that which is a distinct
 
03:08:00.410 --> 03:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
thing and this is kind of where I'm
 
03:08:04.070 --> 03:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
really going is is do we think yet that
 
03:08:06.550 --> 03:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to have an ongoing
 
03:08:10.010 --> 03:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
wedge that the state will always need to
 
03:08:12.830 --> 03:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
put in to supplement the ongoing
 
03:08:15.469 --> 03:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
operations of Hampstead or do we think
 
03:08:17.389 --> 03:08:17.399 align:start position:0%
once we get through this transition
 
03:08:19.790 --> 03:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
there they they will be able to be
 
03:08:22.610 --> 03:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining I don't know if we have
 
03:08:25.309 --> 03:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
the data yet to really make an informed
 
03:08:26.870 --> 03:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
decision on that I mean I can certainly
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
I mean I think every I think I know what
 
03:08:30.469 --> 03:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
everyone's goal is I mean I think we
 
03:08:32.150 --> 03:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
would all love it for to be self-funding
 
03:08:35.150 --> 03:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
but I are excuse me self-funded but
 
03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I I don't yet think we necessarily
 
03:08:40.130 --> 03:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
have the ability to answer that question
 
03:08:42.889 --> 03:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
in the long run because you know we we
 
03:08:45.710 --> 03:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
acquired the facility on June 8th and
 
03:08:47.630 --> 03:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
there's often a two to three month lag
 
03:08:50.090 --> 03:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
in receiving those patient revenues so
 
03:08:51.469 --> 03:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
even though it's you know three months
 
03:08:54.830 --> 03:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
it can be longer right yes
 
03:08:56.510 --> 03:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
um no comment
 
03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
um but but we we're not really there
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
from a from a history perspective of
 
03:09:04.370 --> 03:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
really having what I would be all right
 
03:09:06.290 --> 03:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
I don't want to put you in a corner I
 
03:09:09.170 --> 03:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
just I I it's just a strategic question
 
03:09:11.090 --> 03:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
with Hampstead and I'm just looking for
 
03:09:12.590 --> 03:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
one we think we may have an answer
 
03:09:15.830 --> 03:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's all so you have a question
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative Waller you do I I was
 
03:09:20.750 --> 03:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
wondering how many arpa funds did you
 
03:09:20.760 --> 03:09:22.070 align:start position:0%
wondering how many arpa funds did you
receive

03:09:22.070 --> 03:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
receive
 
03:09:22.080 --> 03:09:28.730 align:start position:0%
receive
oh

03:09:28.730 --> 03:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:32.510 --> 03:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
a little more than nine million dollars
 
03:09:34.790 --> 03:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
over what period of time
 
03:09:40.190 --> 03:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:43.130 --> 03:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
so as a simple math there that there was
 
03:09:45.410 --> 03:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
9 million there's not nine million so we
 
03:09:47.450 --> 03:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
need to come up with nine million or
 
03:09:53.750 --> 03:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:58.250 --> 03:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you anyone else
 
03:10:00.290 --> 03:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
this was one of your special areas that
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
you wanted us to talk about
 
03:10:03.050 --> 03:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren are you
 
03:10:03.060 --> 03:10:05.150 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren are you
satisfied

03:10:05.150 --> 03:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
satisfied
 
03:10:07.849 --> 03:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
all right thank you all right
 
03:10:10.070 --> 03:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh do you have more you have a wrap up
 
03:10:13.250 --> 03:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
you have a finale I bet
 
03:10:15.050 --> 03:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna hand it over to me although I
 
03:10:18.110 --> 03:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
I wish I wish I started because I don't
 
03:10:20.269 --> 03:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
think I could be as eloquent or explain
 
03:10:23.450 --> 03:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
as well as Kathy's done so I apologize
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
in advance so you know it's great it's a
 
03:10:27.950 --> 03:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
good looking suit that's what I was
 
03:10:30.730 --> 03:10:30.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:33.830 --> 03:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm just going to speak a little
 
03:10:36.290 --> 03:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
bit about the the budget and then sort
 
03:10:37.730 --> 03:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
of our organization structure and the
 
03:10:41.210 --> 03:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
field questions as we go all right um so
 
03:10:41.220 --> 03:10:43.070 align:start position:0%
field questions as we go all right um so
um

03:10:43.070 --> 03:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:45.530 --> 03:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
much to your previous question we had um
 
03:10:50.090 --> 03:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
we have 27 State Physicians right now
 
03:10:51.710 --> 03:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
um so six of those are unclassified
 
03:10:51.720 --> 03:10:53.269 align:start position:0%
um so six of those are unclassified
positions

03:10:53.269 --> 03:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
um and those consist of the DHHS
 
03:10:57.410 --> 03:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
executive team and contracts manager and
 
03:10:59.570 --> 03:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
then we have 21 classified physicians in
 
03:11:01.429 --> 03:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
our finance department our health
 
03:11:04.190 --> 03:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
information Department facilities
 
03:11:07.730 --> 03:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
um and then our our biggest chunk of our
 
03:11:10.130 --> 03:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
budget is our our well path contract
 
03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
which consists of 185 positions and that
 
03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
will cover Administration business and
 
03:11:18.170 --> 03:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
HR Support maintenance clinical health
 
03:11:20.870 --> 03:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
care and program services
 
03:11:24.050 --> 03:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
any questions on that so so you'll find
 
03:11:25.849 --> 03:11:25.859 align:start position:0%
if you come back that I have a pet rock
 
03:11:29.530 --> 03:11:29.540 align:start position:0%
with uh it and and you were
 
03:11:32.330 --> 03:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient in I.T prior to the
 
03:11:34.910 --> 03:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
state moving in and now you have a
 
03:11:37.550 --> 03:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
department of I.T that is supposed to be
 
03:11:40.309 --> 03:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
worried about uh core infrastructure
 
03:11:43.450 --> 03:11:43.460 align:start position:0%
that's common and and Security Services
 
03:11:46.849 --> 03:11:46.859 align:start position:0%
to what extent are the I.T departments
 
03:11:48.830 --> 03:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
at this point integrated or is that
 
03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
still a major work in progress It's a
 
03:11:53.510 --> 03:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
work in progress so we're still in the
 
03:11:57.349 --> 03:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
the wiring phase of putting uh the
 
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
cabling through the the building we do
 
03:12:03.830 --> 03:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
have I mean access to State Employees
 
03:12:05.570 --> 03:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
have access to all the systems and
 
03:12:07.010 --> 03:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
things that they need to perform their
 
03:12:09.170 --> 03:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
job while path has access to all their
 
03:12:11.690 --> 03:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
system but the integration is still a
 
03:12:14.269 --> 03:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
work in progress and and I would assume
 
03:12:15.830 --> 03:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
during that work in progress that
 
03:12:18.889 --> 03:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely no concern additional
 
03:12:22.190 --> 03:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
or incremental concern of about security
 
03:12:24.410 --> 03:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
or privacy of the data
 
03:12:27.110 --> 03:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
that that part of that those issues are
 
03:12:29.570 --> 03:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
stable and it's and and they're okay
 
03:12:29.580 --> 03:12:30.590 align:start position:0%
stable and it's and and they're okay
yeah

03:12:30.590 --> 03:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:12:34.250 --> 03:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
we're a paper facility oh no
 
03:12:36.530 --> 03:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
we gotta make you more vulnerable and
 
03:12:41.150 --> 03:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:43.010 --> 03:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
oh my God
 
03:12:45.849 --> 03:12:45.859 align:start position:0%
all your fax machines and everything or
 
03:12:57.769 --> 03:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:59.269 --> 03:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:13:01.250 --> 03:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
the wrong time the wrong day to be
 
03:13:04.730 --> 03:13:04.740 align:start position:0%
asking this but it goes down in 24 and
 
03:13:08.570 --> 03:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
25 by almost that magic 9 million
 
03:13:08.580 --> 03:13:10.309 align:start position:0%
25 by almost that magic 9 million
dollars

03:13:10.309 --> 03:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:13:12.650 --> 03:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
have you are you renegotiating a
 
03:13:14.870 --> 03:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
contract with
 
03:13:17.150 --> 03:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
so those were the startup costs
 
03:13:19.370 --> 03:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
03:13:21.650 --> 03:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
um with the well path uh partnership
 
03:13:24.530 --> 03:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
okay so they anticipated it was around a
 
03:13:27.050 --> 03:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
10 million dollar cost okay I think they
 
03:13:28.429 --> 03:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
will have them for the next two years
 
03:13:32.330 --> 03:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:34.910 --> 03:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
I think that covers your remarks you're
 
03:13:36.530 --> 03:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
prepared to make today
 
03:13:38.809 --> 03:13:38.819 align:start position:0%
did you are you all done are you guys
 
03:13:41.870 --> 03:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I can I can wrap it up I I think
 
03:13:43.610 --> 03:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
Miss Tilly has some place to go we
 
03:13:44.870 --> 03:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
should give her a chance totally fine
 
03:13:47.389 --> 03:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
with me so so I gotta tell you the the
 
03:13:49.670 --> 03:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
most fascinating thing I heard is that
 
03:13:51.530 --> 03:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
you're still in the paper world I don't
 
03:13:53.090 --> 03:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
know how you survived right because
 
03:13:55.670 --> 03:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
every payer is pushing you to go
 
03:13:59.210 --> 03:13:59.220 align:start position:0%
electronic like a decade ago so so what
 
03:14:00.830 --> 03:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
happened what what what what what
 
03:14:05.269 --> 03:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
created sort of this uh you know this
 
03:14:08.090 --> 03:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
vacuum of where you guys can still be
 
03:14:09.950 --> 03:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
paper-based and you don't have an I.T
 
03:14:09.960 --> 03:14:12.110 align:start position:0%
paper-based and you don't have an I.T
system

03:14:12.110 --> 03:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:14:15.590 --> 03:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:18.290 --> 03:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
it was Finance driven when we were
 
03:14:21.050 --> 03:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Outlook and we do have that is
 
03:14:24.290 --> 03:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
part of our our budgeting processes we
 
03:14:27.230 --> 03:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
actually will be moving to an electronic
 
03:14:30.410 --> 03:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
world so your your financial stuff is
 
03:14:33.170 --> 03:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
digital and electronic but the the
 
03:14:36.290 --> 03:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
clinical record keeping is not yet
 
03:14:39.950 --> 03:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly some somewhat on the
 
03:14:43.250 --> 03:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
finance side okay well good I just make
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
a great project for a few people yeah so
 
03:14:47.150 --> 03:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you are there any
 
03:14:49.610 --> 03:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
other questions for the committee all
 
03:14:56.330 --> 03:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:00.050 --> 03:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
Miss Tilly I think you know you're next
 
03:15:03.469 --> 03:15:03.479 align:start position:0%
it said 1 30 or 2. I think I think we
 
03:15:53.150 --> 03:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:55.130 --> 03:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
well thank you so much for having me for
 
03:15:57.590 --> 03:15:57.600 align:start position:0%

03:15:59.630 --> 03:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
am the director of Public Health most
 
03:16:02.870 --> 03:16:02.880 align:start position:0%

03:16:05.990 --> 03:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
I am pleased to be here today to present
 
03:16:08.450 --> 03:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
some information about the impact and
 
03:16:11.630 --> 03:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
planning for the expiration of 19 funds
 
03:16:13.910 --> 03:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
I'm only going to talk about covid
 
03:16:16.910 --> 03:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
related items only time we'll have time
 
03:16:18.410 --> 03:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
later in the budgeting process to hear
 
03:16:20.330 --> 03:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
about the full range of activities that
 
03:16:22.490 --> 03:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
we do in public health but of course I'm
 
03:16:23.690 --> 03:16:23.700 align:start position:0%
always happy to answer any questions
 
03:16:26.750 --> 03:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
that you have this presentation is
 
03:16:28.929 --> 03:16:28.939 align:start position:0%
really a look back and a look forward
 
03:16:31.730 --> 03:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
public health will participate in all of
 
03:16:33.650 --> 03:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
the department-wide efforts in terms of
 
03:16:36.170 --> 03:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
strategic planning but what I plan to
 
03:16:38.269 --> 03:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
share today are the areas in which we
 
03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
know we'll need more attention and
 
03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
resources as we move forward I'm going
 
03:16:44.750 --> 03:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
to talk about covid-19 investments in
 
03:16:47.530 --> 03:16:47.540 align:start position:0%
our laboratory disease investigation
 
03:16:50.809 --> 03:16:50.819 align:start position:0%
immunization data modernization and
 
03:16:52.849 --> 03:16:52.859 align:start position:0%
public health informatics Community
 
03:16:55.450 --> 03:16:55.460 align:start position:0%
Investments and public health Workforce
 
03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
in response to representative Edwards
 
03:17:00.710 --> 03:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
earlier question around statutory
 
03:17:00.720 --> 03:17:01.990 align:start position:0%
earlier question around statutory
Authority

03:17:01.990 --> 03:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
03:17:05.030 --> 03:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
I have highlighted on the slides some
 
03:17:08.090 --> 03:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
areas the specific rsas that enable our
 
03:17:11.690 --> 03:17:11.700 align:start position:0%
work I also have a separate summary so I
 
03:17:13.070 --> 03:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
don't know Kevin if you would like this
 
03:17:16.130 --> 03:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
now or when we come back in for the
 
03:17:16.140 --> 03:17:17.750 align:start position:0%
now or when we come back in for the
budget

03:17:17.750 --> 03:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:17:19.670 --> 03:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
here separate summary
 
03:17:22.730 --> 03:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
um I I gathered all of our statutes just
 
03:17:24.769 --> 03:17:24.779 align:start position:0%
at a very high level for everything we
 
03:17:26.450 --> 03:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
do across the division of Public Health
 
03:17:28.550 --> 03:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
Services as you can imagine we've it's
 
03:17:29.870 --> 03:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's a stack
 
03:17:31.250 --> 03:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
um so I have that available if you want
 
03:17:32.809 --> 03:17:32.819 align:start position:0%
to look at that now you can look at that
 
03:17:35.150 --> 03:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
later or never all of those would be
 
03:17:35.160 --> 03:17:36.349 align:start position:0%
later or never all of those would be
good

03:17:36.349 --> 03:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:17:36.359 --> 03:17:37.730 align:start position:0%
good
so

03:17:37.730 --> 03:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
um let's Jump Right In because I know
 
03:17:40.309 --> 03:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
that all of you have been here and it's
 
03:17:43.309 --> 03:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
been a long day so on slide two
 
03:17:44.809 --> 03:17:44.819 align:start position:0%
um this is just sort of the super high
 
03:17:47.450 --> 03:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
overview of of Public Health in general
 
03:17:49.309 --> 03:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
and and you heard from the commissioner
 
03:17:50.570 --> 03:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
that we just have an extraordinary
 
03:17:52.250 --> 03:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
breadth of responsibilities in the
 
03:17:55.010 --> 03:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
department each division Public Health
 
03:17:58.130 --> 03:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Medicaid each also has their
 
03:18:00.590 --> 03:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
own business model public health is
 
03:18:02.750 --> 03:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
primarily funded by federal and other
 
03:18:05.090 --> 03:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
funds to meet our broad mission of
 
03:18:07.309 --> 03:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
protecting promoting and improving the
 
03:18:09.590 --> 03:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
health of everyone in the state of New
 
03:18:11.570 --> 03:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire again we talked about this a
 
03:18:13.370 --> 03:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
little bit earlier in some of the other
 
03:18:15.050 --> 03:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
hearings that New Hampshire that public
 
03:18:17.570 --> 03:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
health really is population based we
 
03:18:20.269 --> 03:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
don't have a set of clientele like
 
03:18:22.070 --> 03:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
Hampstead does our job is really to look
 
03:18:24.110 --> 03:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
out for everybody
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
um so are federal funds come through
 
03:18:29.809 --> 03:18:29.819 align:start position:0%
more than 50 separate uh federal grants
 
03:18:33.349 --> 03:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's a lot to manage and we and some of
 
03:18:35.330 --> 03:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
these funds are very temporary in nature
 
03:18:37.490 --> 03:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
especially with regard to covid-19
 
03:18:40.130 --> 03:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
they're meant to be an influx and then
 
03:18:41.389 --> 03:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to go away
 
03:18:44.570 --> 03:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
so when you look at the covid era 400
 
03:18:46.010 --> 03:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
plus staff that's a different number
 
03:18:47.630 --> 03:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
than what you saw
 
03:18:50.630 --> 03:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
um Nathan present before a significant
 
03:18:52.610 --> 03:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
number of those positions are temporary
 
03:18:55.429 --> 03:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
positions they're what we call nine T's
 
03:18:57.469 --> 03:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
eight T's there's a lot of part-time
 
03:18:59.450 --> 03:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
positions in there as as Nathan
 
03:19:02.269 --> 03:19:02.279 align:start position:0%
described we Flex these positions and
 
03:19:04.490 --> 03:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
they are filled and demobilized and
 
03:19:06.650 --> 03:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
filled and demobilized at frequent
 
03:19:08.330 --> 03:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
intervals to meet the need that we have
 
03:19:10.849 --> 03:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
we anticipate and are planning for
 
03:19:12.469 --> 03:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
reductions in the workforce as we
 
03:19:14.750 --> 03:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
transition out of covid
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
um I'll also note that in these 50 to 60
 
03:19:19.790 --> 03:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
grants again across the entire book of
 
03:19:21.650 --> 03:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
business in public health
 
03:19:23.690 --> 03:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
um that's what makes me a frequent flyer
 
03:19:25.190 --> 03:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
to come to fiscal all the time because
 
03:19:26.990 --> 03:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
we're constantly adding money to the
 
03:19:28.730 --> 03:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
budget outside of the state budgeting
 
03:19:30.849 --> 03:19:30.859 align:start position:0%
process or
 
03:19:33.050 --> 03:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
re-reallocating the money or asking for
 
03:19:34.910 --> 03:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
a redirect because we're constantly
 
03:19:37.730 --> 03:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
trying to make right the where the money
 
03:19:39.889 --> 03:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
is going and where the needs are so
 
03:19:41.330 --> 03:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
let's take a look at a pandemic
 
03:19:43.730 --> 03:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
framework that we have and that's on
 
03:19:45.889 --> 03:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
slide three so if we think about the
 
03:19:47.809 --> 03:19:47.819 align:start position:0%
pandemic response that we have all lived
 
03:19:49.309 --> 03:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
through you can think about it in three
 
03:19:51.590 --> 03:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
rough stages there were the early days
 
03:19:54.710 --> 03:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
in 2020 when we didn't have swabs to go
 
03:19:57.050 --> 03:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
up people's noses to test individuals we
 
03:19:59.090 --> 03:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough PPE anywhere we
 
03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
didn't have masks to protect our front
 
03:20:04.010 --> 03:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
line workers and then you know we
 
03:20:05.150 --> 03:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
remember that we had to get the
 
03:20:06.830 --> 03:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
deployment of the National Guard just to
 
03:20:08.690 --> 03:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
even get a test I mean these are all the
 
03:20:10.550 --> 03:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
things that we live through many of us
 
03:20:12.469 --> 03:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
have tried to forget some of it but it
 
03:20:13.670 --> 03:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
really is important when you think about
 
03:20:15.170 --> 03:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that you're seeing
 
03:20:15.180 --> 03:20:16.190 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that you're seeing
here

03:20:16.190 --> 03:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:20:18.349 --> 03:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
um you know and and right now we're at a
 
03:20:19.910 --> 03:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
place where you can go get a covid
 
03:20:22.730 --> 03:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
antigen test at CVS you know in the next
 
03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
two minutes and and check yourself
 
03:20:27.590 --> 03:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
um those early days
 
03:20:29.750 --> 03:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
um required us to mitigate the spread
 
03:20:31.790 --> 03:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
through active case investigation
 
03:20:35.030 --> 03:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
contact tracing who remembers that it's
 
03:20:36.290 --> 03:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
long gone
 
03:20:38.330 --> 03:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
um and because we didn't have the tools
 
03:20:40.490 --> 03:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
that we have now around vaccines or
 
03:20:43.490 --> 03:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
life-saving therapy during that time we
 
03:20:46.070 --> 03:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
experienced deaths of residents in
 
03:20:48.590 --> 03:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
long-term care and facilities and other
 
03:20:51.410 --> 03:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
chronic I mean in other congregate
 
03:20:53.570 --> 03:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
settings and and also people just living
 
03:20:56.030 --> 03:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
in the community many of us lost family
 
03:20:58.250 --> 03:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
members in those early days we lost
 
03:21:00.110 --> 03:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers we've had over 20
 
03:21:02.030 --> 03:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers die in the state
 
03:21:04.010 --> 03:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
and we lost leaders in our community
 
03:21:05.929 --> 03:21:05.939 align:start position:0%
including some leadership even here in
 
03:21:07.250 --> 03:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
03:21:09.769 --> 03:21:09.779 align:start position:0%
we focused on mitigation you look at
 
03:21:11.570 --> 03:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
these air things that we got in here we
 
03:21:14.150 --> 03:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
focused on mitigation efforts we focused
 
03:21:16.790 --> 03:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
on social distancing policy makers like
 
03:21:18.769 --> 03:21:18.779 align:start position:0%
yourselves debated whether and how
 
03:21:20.929 --> 03:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
restaurants could open how we fly on
 
03:21:23.690 --> 03:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
planes and many of us became overnight
 
03:21:27.290 --> 03:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
experts on on air handling state and
 
03:21:29.690 --> 03:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
federal resources dropped out of you
 
03:21:32.030 --> 03:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
know the sky on us some of them were
 
03:21:34.070 --> 03:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily helpful some of them
 
03:21:36.230 --> 03:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
kept us afloat and and some were
 
03:21:37.550 --> 03:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
probably less than helpful and I think
 
03:21:39.769 --> 03:21:39.779 align:start position:0%
we've all learned a lot from that all
 
03:21:41.929 --> 03:21:41.939 align:start position:0%
while we waited for those vaccines and
 
03:21:44.389 --> 03:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
the Therapeutics to be available and
 
03:21:46.250 --> 03:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
once those vaccines became available and
 
03:21:48.769 --> 03:21:48.779 align:start position:0%
we were able to make some hard decisions
 
03:21:50.690 --> 03:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
about who was first on the list who was
 
03:21:51.950 --> 03:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
last on the list I mean you might
 
03:21:54.110 --> 03:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
remember I I have social media it
 
03:21:56.030 --> 03:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
reminds me of what I did on every day in
 
03:21:57.830 --> 03:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
the past few years and I again it's
 
03:21:59.870 --> 03:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
probably a little PTSD when I see some
 
03:22:01.309 --> 03:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
of the things that happened in the past
 
03:22:02.929 --> 03:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
three years but I think it's helpful
 
03:22:04.490 --> 03:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
again for the context of the amount of
 
03:22:06.830 --> 03:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
work that was put in over the past three
 
03:22:09.070 --> 03:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
years so now here we are with
 
03:22:11.929 --> 03:22:11.939 align:start position:0%
life-saving tools vaccines updated
 
03:22:14.690 --> 03:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
boosters effective Therapeutics we have
 
03:22:17.570 --> 03:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
most of what we need not everything but
 
03:22:18.889 --> 03:22:18.899 align:start position:0%
we have most of everything to keep
 
03:22:21.969 --> 03:22:21.979 align:start position:0%
people healthy most notably
 
03:22:24.769 --> 03:22:24.779 align:start position:0%
Workforce and Technology being the thing
 
03:22:27.889 --> 03:22:27.899 align:start position:0%
that's still in Need for us so you know
 
03:22:29.990 --> 03:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
if we translate or skip to the next
 
03:22:32.630 --> 03:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
slide we've gotten number four you know
 
03:22:34.670 --> 03:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
why did we put all this money into covid
 
03:22:37.450 --> 03:22:37.460 align:start position:0%
well because 3 000 people have died
 
03:22:40.610 --> 03:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
can we check slide transitions sure okay
 
03:22:43.910 --> 03:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
I am on slide four which is the so so I
 
03:22:46.910 --> 03:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
have a couple of questions sure
 
03:22:50.750 --> 03:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
um when it when you say uh and is is
 
03:22:54.190 --> 03:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
that is Are We Now aiming at uh 11 May
 
03:22:57.830 --> 03:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
the federal end date so that is the end
 
03:23:00.650 --> 03:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
of the Federal Emergency covet isn't
 
03:23:02.650 --> 03:23:02.660 align:start position:0%
going to magically disappear
 
03:23:04.910 --> 03:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
but but this is kind of where we're
 
03:23:06.769 --> 03:23:06.779 align:start position:0%
expecting where we're heading money and
 
03:23:09.349 --> 03:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines and all that stuff so
 
03:23:10.550 --> 03:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of those federal
 
03:23:12.410 --> 03:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
guidelines will change most of them have
 
03:23:15.170 --> 03:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
changed already we have not you know uh
 
03:23:18.110 --> 03:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
after the State of Emergency the New
 
03:23:19.610 --> 03:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire states of emergency that
 
03:23:21.290 --> 03:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
really had the most impact on public
 
03:23:23.450 --> 03:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
health you know all of those that's long
 
03:23:23.460 --> 03:23:24.590 align:start position:0%
health you know all of those that's long
gone

03:23:24.590 --> 03:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
gone
 
03:23:27.290 --> 03:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
um our work won't fundam May 11th won't
 
03:23:29.450 --> 03:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
fundamentally change what we do in
 
03:23:32.110 --> 03:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
public it's just another day
 
03:23:34.370 --> 03:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
the end of the story I'll give you you
 
03:23:36.110 --> 03:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
know the end of the movie Fast you know
 
03:23:38.450 --> 03:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
it's really uh we're gonna run out of
 
03:23:42.110 --> 03:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
money in June uh 2024 in a lot of areas
 
03:23:44.809 --> 03:23:44.819 align:start position:0%
we expect we'll get a one-year no-cost
 
03:23:46.610 --> 03:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
extension to spend out what we didn't
 
03:23:48.889 --> 03:23:48.899 align:start position:0%
spend in some of those funding sources
 
03:23:51.290 --> 03:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
we're going to be at a real loss you
 
03:23:54.410 --> 03:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
know a real dip in our resources in 26
 
03:23:56.990 --> 03:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
and 27. so if you're planning this next
 
03:24:00.050 --> 03:24:00.060 align:start position:0%
biennium we still have money
 
03:24:02.330 --> 03:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
it's the biennium after that is going to
 
03:24:04.550 --> 03:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
be that's going to require planning one
 
03:24:07.010 --> 03:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
more question about that
 
03:24:10.190 --> 03:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
um commissioner shivanay uh almost a
 
03:24:12.950 --> 03:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
year ago talked to me in passing about
 
03:24:15.710 --> 03:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
there being an after action review to
 
03:24:17.330 --> 03:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
see if we could document the lessons
 
03:24:20.090 --> 03:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
learned and she said that that she was
 
03:24:21.650 --> 03:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
going to get Contract support for that
 
03:24:23.929 --> 03:24:23.939 align:start position:0%
do you do you happen to know where we
 
03:24:25.610 --> 03:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
are on whether or not we're really going
 
03:24:27.889 --> 03:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
to do that so I think it's happening in
 
03:24:30.530 --> 03:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
a multitude of ways so Homeland Security
 
03:24:32.450 --> 03:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
is in the process of doing an after
 
03:24:34.429 --> 03:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
action report right now and so that's
 
03:24:36.050 --> 03:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
going to look at a lot of our response
 
03:24:37.309 --> 03:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
including some of the public health
 
03:24:40.130 --> 03:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
response as well so that's a very high
 
03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
level after action we'll participate in
 
03:24:44.510 --> 03:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
that that's ongoing
 
03:24:46.490 --> 03:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you that in each of my
 
03:24:48.349 --> 03:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
little areas and by little areas I mean
 
03:24:50.090 --> 03:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
our laboratory our infectious disease
 
03:24:52.490 --> 03:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
those areas we're doing those individual
 
03:24:55.610 --> 03:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
after actions on our own right now and
 
03:24:58.130 --> 03:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
really understanding in almost real time
 
03:25:00.469 --> 03:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
what worked and what didn't work and and
 
03:25:03.769 --> 03:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
will there be public-facing reports on
 
03:25:05.809 --> 03:25:05.819 align:start position:0%
the Lessons Learned certainly the
 
03:25:07.370 --> 03:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security emergency management
 
03:25:09.469 --> 03:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
report will be very public and then
 
03:25:11.210 --> 03:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
certainly anything that we do can be
 
03:25:14.750 --> 03:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
made public as well okay are you are you
 
03:25:16.490 --> 03:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
including right-wing conspiracy
 
03:25:19.429 --> 03:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
theorists in order to make sure that we
 
03:25:21.410 --> 03:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
get a lessons learned that covers a
 
03:25:23.630 --> 03:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
broad range I think
 
03:25:25.490 --> 03:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
I'll come to ask us questions anytime
 
03:25:27.229 --> 03:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
and we're happy to provide any
 
03:25:29.990 --> 03:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
information that's asked okay
 
03:25:32.389 --> 03:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome so
 
03:25:35.570 --> 03:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
it causes a death on that slide of note
 
03:25:37.670 --> 03:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
coven was the third leading fourth
 
03:25:39.710 --> 03:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
leading cause of death in 2020 so again
 
03:25:42.769 --> 03:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
march to you know we coveted started in
 
03:25:44.929 --> 03:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
March of 2020 between March and December
 
03:25:47.570 --> 03:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
it was the fourth leading cause of death
 
03:25:48.950 --> 03:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
that year because that was the year we
 
03:25:51.950 --> 03:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
were all locked down by 2021 and we all
 
03:25:53.990 --> 03:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
let we're out and about more people died
 
03:25:55.969 --> 03:25:55.979 align:start position:0%
because we were out and about what we're
 
03:25:58.490 --> 03:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
going to see in 2022 the final death
 
03:26:00.590 --> 03:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
data is not finalized so I haven't
 
03:26:02.750 --> 03:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
provided it for you because it takes a
 
03:26:04.370 --> 03:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
long time to get death data from other
 
03:26:06.830 --> 03:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
states of New Hampshire residents we are
 
03:26:09.889 --> 03:26:09.899 align:start position:0%
likely to bump down to the fifth leading
 
03:26:12.110 --> 03:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
cause of death in 2022 for New Hampshire
 
03:26:14.269 --> 03:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
which is different than that at the
 
03:26:15.469 --> 03:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
national number it looks like it's going
 
03:26:18.110 --> 03:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
to stay third so we are different it may
 
03:26:19.969 --> 03:26:19.979 align:start position:0%
be that we are different again those are
 
03:26:22.550 --> 03:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
speculative they are preliminary numbers
 
03:26:24.110 --> 03:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
at this point because we need to count
 
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
every death but it really does look that
 
03:26:29.570 --> 03:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
we took a a step down in 2022 which is
 
03:26:31.070 --> 03:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
great news that's exactly what we want
 
03:26:32.269 --> 03:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
that's the reason we've spent all this
 
03:26:34.969 --> 03:26:34.979 align:start position:0%
money money right so so in the old days
 
03:26:38.150 --> 03:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
people would die of flu yeah uh is that
 
03:26:40.309 --> 03:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
the is that the category chronic lower
 
03:26:43.370 --> 03:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
respiratory disease no chronic lower uh
 
03:26:44.929 --> 03:26:44.939 align:start position:0%
respiratory disease is really things
 
03:26:48.050 --> 03:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
like emphysema COPD do we have flu on
 
03:26:49.969 --> 03:26:49.979 align:start position:0%
here anymore flu is not in the top five
 
03:26:51.950 --> 03:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
of leading causes of death we usually
 
03:26:55.910 --> 03:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
have just around 200 230 deaths from flu
 
03:26:58.010 --> 03:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
ently pre-pandemic during the pandemic
 
03:27:00.110 --> 03:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
we know that number bottomed out to very
 
03:27:01.849 --> 03:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
little because people just weren't out
 
03:27:04.250 --> 03:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
and about this year given what's been
 
03:27:05.690 --> 03:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
going around in the respiratory World
 
03:27:06.889 --> 03:27:06.899 align:start position:0%
we're going to see the number probably
 
03:27:08.330 --> 03:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
come back to what we used to see
 
03:27:10.790 --> 03:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic which was in the you know
 
03:27:13.490 --> 03:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
low 200s again that's nothing like the
 
03:27:15.769 --> 03:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
numbers we're seeing with covet
 
03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you Mr chair
 
03:27:21.050 --> 03:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you do you by chance have an age
 
03:27:25.849 --> 03:27:25.859 align:start position:0%
breakdown for these lines for example uh
 
03:27:29.150 --> 03:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
how many five to ten-year-olds and so on
 
03:27:31.370 --> 03:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
so forth passed away from these
 
03:27:33.830 --> 03:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
particularly coveted so um you can see
 
03:27:35.330 --> 03:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
that right now if you wanted to Google
 
03:27:37.670 --> 03:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
it on our New Hampshire kova dashboard
 
03:27:40.729 --> 03:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
we have it broken down into age cohorts
 
03:27:42.889 --> 03:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
you know 5 10 age five to ten years in
 
03:27:44.870 --> 03:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
each age cohort and what the death rates
 
03:27:47.450 --> 03:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
are so those are available right now
 
03:27:49.130 --> 03:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
sure and we can certainly send that link
 
03:27:51.590 --> 03:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure everyone has has it so but
 
03:27:53.210 --> 03:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming in general what we'll
 
03:27:55.670 --> 03:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
notice that the older you are with
 
03:27:59.210 --> 03:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
comorbidities that was 80 90 of the
 
03:28:01.250 --> 03:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
deaths yeah and and in a couple of
 
03:28:02.690 --> 03:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
slides if you look actually you can
 
03:28:04.670 --> 03:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
sneak up in a couple of slides I have
 
03:28:07.370 --> 03:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
our dashboard page and you can see the
 
03:28:09.769 --> 03:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
proportions or the numbers by age rank
 
03:28:12.410 --> 03:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
so again 80 and older that was the group
 
03:28:13.910 --> 03:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
that really had a hard time through
 
03:28:16.250 --> 03:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
covid where we saw deaths you know when
 
03:28:18.110 --> 03:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
we look at things like hospitalizations
 
03:28:20.870 --> 03:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
though which um are incredibly costly
 
03:28:22.910 --> 03:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
you know we see middle-aged we see
 
03:28:25.250 --> 03:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
middle-aged people there the deaths we
 
03:28:27.170 --> 03:28:27.180 align:start position:0%
really saw in older populations but
 
03:28:28.910 --> 03:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
we've even had P you know we've had
 
03:28:31.309 --> 03:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
pediatric deaths as well it's it's
 
03:28:33.650 --> 03:28:33.660 align:start position:0%
occurred in you know for covid in every
 
03:28:36.229 --> 03:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
age group but you know I agree with
 
03:28:38.690 --> 03:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards the real group
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
that took up you know that was
 
03:28:42.050 --> 03:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affected were older
 
03:28:45.050 --> 03:28:45.060 align:start position:0%
adults thank you yeah great so we can
 
03:28:48.290 --> 03:28:48.300 align:start position:0%
switch over to slide fives so let's talk
 
03:28:49.610 --> 03:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the money that's a
 
03:28:52.429 --> 03:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
slide that says dphs biennium budget so
 
03:28:54.650 --> 03:28:54.660 align:start position:0%
more that you know what Nathan said not
 
03:28:55.729 --> 03:28:55.739 align:start position:0%
to talk about money I'm going to give
 
03:28:58.190 --> 03:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
you some very big high level numbers so
 
03:29:00.889 --> 03:29:00.899 align:start position:0%
more than 77 million dollars have been
 
03:29:02.630 --> 03:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
deployed to New Hampshire to address
 
03:29:06.110 --> 03:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
covid-19 these are federal dollars this
 
03:29:08.150 --> 03:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
changed our proportion of federal and
 
03:29:10.849 --> 03:29:10.859 align:start position:0%
general fund mix to you know about seven
 
03:29:12.889 --> 03:29:12.899 align:start position:0%
if you add all of that that means that
 
03:29:16.690 --> 03:29:16.700 align:start position:0%
public health is an entirety is about 77
 
03:29:19.610 --> 03:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
federally funded has about 17 percent
 
03:29:21.229 --> 03:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
other funds and less than 10 percent
 
03:29:24.830 --> 03:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
General funds to manage these funds
 
03:29:26.750 --> 03:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we have developed a number
 
03:29:29.450 --> 03:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
of covid-19 accounting units
 
03:29:31.250 --> 03:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
um that we manage which is again things
 
03:29:33.050 --> 03:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
that we see at the Joint legislative
 
03:29:35.030 --> 03:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee all the time as we move
 
03:29:37.910 --> 03:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
money in and out and redirect that money
 
03:29:41.450 --> 03:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
we added 49 temporary State positions in
 
03:29:43.070 --> 03:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
this biennium that we're currently in
 
03:29:44.450 --> 03:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
not next by any but this current
 
03:29:44.460 --> 03:29:45.769 align:start position:0%
not next by any but this current
biennium

03:29:45.769 --> 03:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
03:29:48.710 --> 03:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
um again I note that those are 98t
 
03:29:51.650 --> 03:29:51.660 align:start position:0%
positions we've also used it Staffing um
 
03:29:53.150 --> 03:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
contracts we heard Hampstead talk about
 
03:29:53.160 --> 03:29:54.349 align:start position:0%
contracts we heard Hampstead talk about
Maxim

03:29:54.349 --> 03:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
Maxim
 
03:29:55.610 --> 03:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
um you know we were the first ones to
 
03:29:56.929 --> 03:29:56.939 align:start position:0%
use Maxim
 
03:29:58.729 --> 03:29:58.739 align:start position:0%
um in public health in those early days
 
03:30:01.849 --> 03:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic you know at our height
 
03:30:05.809 --> 03:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
we had over 250 Maxim staff or within
 
03:30:07.969 --> 03:30:07.979 align:start position:0%
under those temporary contracts that was
 
03:30:10.190 --> 03:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
when we were contact tracing and doing a
 
03:30:12.610 --> 03:30:12.620 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of work we have now
 
03:30:14.809 --> 03:30:14.819 align:start position:0%
demobilized significantly and we're now
 
03:30:17.510 --> 03:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the 40-ish range of of people working
 
03:30:20.210 --> 03:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
on those temporary contracts I think the
 
03:30:22.490 --> 03:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
the message that we would like to uh
 
03:30:24.229 --> 03:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
relay throughout this presentation is
 
03:30:26.269 --> 03:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
we've tried to be as Nimble as possible
 
03:30:29.990 --> 03:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
and um really scale to the need that is
 
03:30:33.429 --> 03:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
presented to us none of us wanted 250
 
03:30:36.290 --> 03:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
temporary staff that was you know that
 
03:30:38.690 --> 03:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
started to max out our ability even to
 
03:30:40.670 --> 03:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
manage at that level
 
03:30:44.450 --> 03:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
so we can move to the next slide so what
 
03:30:46.370 --> 03:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
did this Federal funding enable us to do
 
03:30:47.929 --> 03:30:47.939 align:start position:0%
what do the feds want us to do with the
 
03:30:50.210 --> 03:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
money they wanted us to respond quickly
 
03:30:52.670 --> 03:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
to all infectious diseases they wanted
 
03:30:55.010 --> 03:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
us to prevent those outbreaks they
 
03:30:57.910 --> 03:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
wanted us to do prevention and control
 
03:31:01.370 --> 03:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
they also really understood that in
 
03:31:03.349 --> 03:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
order to do this work to manage this
 
03:31:07.130 --> 03:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
pandemic we needed investments in data
 
03:31:09.370 --> 03:31:09.380 align:start position:0%
modernization Public Health
 
03:31:11.570 --> 03:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
infrastructure informatics and
 
03:31:14.410 --> 03:31:14.420 align:start position:0%
infrastructure communication capacity
 
03:31:16.790 --> 03:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
Workforce capacity not only for those
 
03:31:18.290 --> 03:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
nurses and contact tracers and
 
03:31:20.950 --> 03:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
laboratory folks but across the board
 
03:31:23.570 --> 03:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
all so that we could improve greater
 
03:31:26.090 --> 03:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
outcomes not only the metrics of
 
03:31:28.010 --> 03:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations and deaths you asked
 
03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
earlier about what metrics we used at
 
03:31:32.090 --> 03:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
the end of the day for covid I'm
 
03:31:34.010 --> 03:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
watching hospitalizations and deaths
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
then we can break it down into a million
 
03:31:38.090 --> 03:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
subparts but the number I'm watching
 
03:31:40.190 --> 03:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
every day are hospitalizations and
 
03:31:40.200 --> 03:31:41.510 align:start position:0%
every day are hospitalizations and
deaths

03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
03:31:43.790 --> 03:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
um but the feds also wanted us to do
 
03:31:45.710 --> 03:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
these broader things around in improving
 
03:31:47.690 --> 03:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
things like healthcare quality and
 
03:31:49.610 --> 03:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
Health Equity so I'm going to jump in
 
03:31:51.469 --> 03:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
now unless there's a question into some
 
03:31:54.530 --> 03:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
of the components of the response I want
 
03:31:56.389 --> 03:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
to I want to talk about these two slides
 
03:31:59.210 --> 03:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
interacting together the your biennium
 
03:32:01.309 --> 03:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
budget slide with the 49 temporary
 
03:32:04.250 --> 03:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
positions and and then the bullet slide
 
03:32:07.010 --> 03:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
that follows
 
03:32:10.070 --> 03:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
um okay so we received uh temporary
 
03:32:13.070 --> 03:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
money to do temporary work
 
03:32:16.849 --> 03:32:16.859 align:start position:0%
um and uh to what extent do you imagine
 
03:32:19.969 --> 03:32:19.979 align:start position:0%
that temporary work actually going away
 
03:32:22.729 --> 03:32:22.739 align:start position:0%
completely versus there will be some
 
03:32:24.590 --> 03:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
Vestige appendage that we need to
 
03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
continue to support that's that's the
 
03:32:28.190 --> 03:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
million dollar question it's probably
 
03:32:30.110 --> 03:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
more than a million dollars but it is a
 
03:32:31.790 --> 03:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
million dollar question hoping you could
 
03:32:35.570 --> 03:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
keep it to 900 000. I try to keep all my
 
03:32:37.490 --> 03:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
accounting units to 900 000 because then
 
03:32:39.469 --> 03:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
they don't come to your budget hearings
 
03:32:39.479 --> 03:32:41.110 align:start position:0%
they don't come to your budget hearings
um

03:32:41.110 --> 03:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:43.429 --> 03:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
so you know I don't know the number
 
03:32:45.710 --> 03:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
right now I mean that's really the magic
 
03:32:47.090 --> 03:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
and I think we're going to know it over
 
03:32:49.490 --> 03:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
the next two years but I can tell you I
 
03:32:50.809 --> 03:32:50.819 align:start position:0%
know where we're going to need it we're
 
03:32:53.450 --> 03:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
going to need money in informatics we're
 
03:32:54.889 --> 03:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
going to need money probably a little
 
03:32:56.389 --> 03:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
bit of money in our laboratory because
 
03:32:57.889 --> 03:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
we're trying to right size this
 
03:32:59.750 --> 03:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
laboratory and
 
03:33:00.950 --> 03:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and we're going to need some money
 
03:33:03.110 --> 03:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
and overall preparedness
 
03:33:05.150 --> 03:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
um and then probably a decision that
 
03:33:07.010 --> 03:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
will have to be made both at the federal
 
03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
level of what they're going to fund and
 
03:33:10.610 --> 03:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
if the you know the state general funds
 
03:33:12.170 --> 03:33:12.180 align:start position:0%
want to wants to fund any of those
 
03:33:13.969 --> 03:33:13.979 align:start position:0%
Community Investments things like
 
03:33:15.830 --> 03:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
community health workers that's going to
 
03:33:18.590 --> 03:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
be a question for this legislature and
 
03:33:20.690 --> 03:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
and our federal Partners to decide is
 
03:33:22.250 --> 03:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
that something that we want to continue
 
03:33:24.830 --> 03:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely that the department is
 
03:33:26.690 --> 03:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
going to come and ask for that money in
 
03:33:28.250 --> 03:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
general funds but I think that those
 
03:33:29.929 --> 03:33:29.939 align:start position:0%
policy decisions will probably be made
 
03:33:33.650 --> 03:33:33.660 align:start position:0%
here okay but I I think I'm also hearing
 
03:33:35.929 --> 03:33:35.939 align:start position:0%
that there's enough arpa money to get us
 
03:33:38.210 --> 03:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
through the bulk of this budget that
 
03:33:40.250 --> 03:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
we're about to prepare and even though
 
03:33:43.190 --> 03:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
that you don't have the answer now or
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
soon we've got a couple of years to work
 
03:33:51.290 --> 03:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:53.929 --> 03:33:53.939 align:start position:0%
that's a huge relief thank you yeah we
 
03:33:55.910 --> 03:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
have we're in good shape that way we
 
03:33:58.670 --> 03:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
should have enough money of all of the
 
03:34:00.889 --> 03:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
federal pennies that fell from heaven
 
03:34:03.530 --> 03:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
to get us through the next two years
 
03:34:06.170 --> 03:34:06.180 align:start position:0%
um it's really the next biennium that is
 
03:34:10.429 --> 03:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:11.929 --> 03:34:11.939 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:34:13.550 --> 03:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
um so let's go into the lab a little bit
 
03:34:16.610 --> 03:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
so this is a on the lab slide it's
 
03:34:18.170 --> 03:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
number seven
 
03:34:20.510 --> 03:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
um that's a little screenshot from WMUR
 
03:34:24.769 --> 03:34:24.779 align:start position:0%
when we had five cases of covid-19 and
 
03:34:26.990 --> 03:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
it was newsworthy that we had five cases
 
03:34:29.150 --> 03:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
of coven 19.
 
03:34:30.769 --> 03:34:30.779 align:start position:0%
um we have put a tremendous amount of
 
03:34:33.410 --> 03:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
money you heard earlier the acronym ELC
 
03:34:36.469 --> 03:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
which is our epidemiology laboratory
 
03:34:39.410 --> 03:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
capacity Cooperative agreement that's a
 
03:34:39.420 --> 03:34:40.429 align:start position:0%
capacity Cooperative agreement that's a
mouthful

03:34:40.429 --> 03:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
mouthful
 
03:34:42.229 --> 03:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
um we've gotten lots of additional
 
03:34:44.450 --> 03:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
Federal resources through that Federal
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
grant to support our laboratory services
 
03:34:48.650 --> 03:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
our testing
 
03:34:50.630 --> 03:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
um testing that occurs outside of our
 
03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
laboratory so again remember when we
 
03:34:55.370 --> 03:34:55.380 align:start position:0%
tested kids at school we tested kids at
 
03:34:57.229 --> 03:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
summer camp that all came from federal
 
03:34:59.330 --> 03:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
resources we don't do that anymore those
 
03:35:01.250 --> 03:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
you know those funds have we don't we
 
03:35:02.630 --> 03:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
don't need to use them schools are not
 
03:35:04.010 --> 03:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
interested in that others are not
 
03:35:06.229 --> 03:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
interested in that right now we've also
 
03:35:07.969 --> 03:35:07.979 align:start position:0%
used this to support things like
 
03:35:11.090 --> 03:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
Wastewater sampling we've bought some
 
03:35:13.610 --> 03:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
equipment we've used this opportunity to
 
03:35:15.229 --> 03:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
upgrade a lot of the equipment in our
 
03:35:16.790 --> 03:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
laboratory we're always going to take a
 
03:35:19.070 --> 03:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
moment to say if the money's coming you
 
03:35:21.170 --> 03:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
know I will use it now so that because
 
03:35:22.490 --> 03:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
we don't know that we'll have those
 
03:35:24.650 --> 03:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
resources later on and of course we've
 
03:35:26.929 --> 03:35:26.939 align:start position:0%
used it for Workforce
 
03:35:30.110 --> 03:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
um in in the lab you know my just a
 
03:35:32.690 --> 03:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
reminder to back in those days in 2021
 
03:35:34.910 --> 03:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
we had two shifts of workers working
 
03:35:37.429 --> 03:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
seven days a week in our laboratory and
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
infectious disease it was an
 
03:35:41.389 --> 03:35:41.399 align:start position:0%
extraordinary effort I I'm not you know
 
03:35:43.610 --> 03:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
other than our 24 7 facilities I don't
 
03:35:46.070 --> 03:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
know where else we were working two
 
03:35:48.650 --> 03:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
shifts seven days a week Department of
 
03:35:50.330 --> 03:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
Transportation is probably the our other
 
03:35:52.250 --> 03:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
folks who do that so that's our
 
03:35:54.490 --> 03:35:54.500 align:start position:0%
laboratory fun fact for you on here
 
03:35:58.550 --> 03:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
rsa131 it is the oldest piece of um
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
statute that we have on the books
 
03:36:02.030 --> 03:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
related to Public Health the original
 
03:36:05.809 --> 03:36:05.819 align:start position:0%
date on it was 1911. so that is when we
 
03:36:08.030 --> 03:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
were put into statue to start work have
 
03:36:09.530 --> 03:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
elaborate what was called the laboratory
 
03:36:12.050 --> 03:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
of hygiene
 
03:36:15.170 --> 03:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
all right no question huh we've been
 
03:36:16.969 --> 03:36:16.979 align:start position:0%
we've been going since
 
03:36:18.349 --> 03:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
um the next slide is around disease
 
03:36:20.210 --> 03:36:20.220 align:start position:0%
investigation the you know this is
 
03:36:21.590 --> 03:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
probably the most obvious to people
 
03:36:23.570 --> 03:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
around what people think we've done with
 
03:36:26.330 --> 03:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
our coveted money you know it is
 
03:36:30.050 --> 03:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
um uh RSA again rsa141c gives us the
 
03:36:31.849 --> 03:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
authority to investigate control and
 
03:36:33.650 --> 03:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
prevent infectious diseases that's
 
03:36:35.570 --> 03:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
that's pretty old on the books as well
 
03:36:39.050 --> 03:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
not 1911 old but still pretty old
 
03:36:41.150 --> 03:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
um you know at the end of the deck you
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
will see I've given you a list of all of
 
03:36:45.349 --> 03:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
our reportable conditions the way it
 
03:36:48.769 --> 03:36:48.779 align:start position:0%
works in New Hampshire is we have uh
 
03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to collect
 
03:36:50.640 --> 03:36:52.309 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to collect
reportable

03:36:52.309 --> 03:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
reportable
 
03:36:55.130 --> 03:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
um communicable diseases in rule we
 
03:36:56.990 --> 03:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
develop what those diseases are
 
03:36:59.750 --> 03:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
certainly using um other resources like
 
03:37:02.929 --> 03:37:02.939 align:start position:0%
CDC and others to help frame that on
 
03:37:04.729 --> 03:37:04.739 align:start position:0%
that list you'll see everything from
 
03:37:06.950 --> 03:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
chlamydia to E coli
 
03:37:09.950 --> 03:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
um you don't see covid-19 though spelled
 
03:37:12.590 --> 03:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
out that and people often ask about that
 
03:37:14.690 --> 03:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
that coveted 19 was captured at the very
 
03:37:17.570 --> 03:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
bottom of that list which is for novel
 
03:37:20.510 --> 03:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
diseases of concern so as you will
 
03:37:22.969 --> 03:37:22.979 align:start position:0%
remember that it was uh we were the
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
novel coronavirus that's how we started
 
03:37:26.809 --> 03:37:26.819 align:start position:0%
talking about covet so it is captured
 
03:37:28.910 --> 03:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
underneath that
 
03:37:31.190 --> 03:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
um right now what we're doing you know
 
03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
we're not doing contact tracing that has
 
03:37:34.849 --> 03:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
gone away
 
03:37:37.070 --> 03:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
um but what we've really settled into
 
03:37:39.290 --> 03:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
the work and its ongoing work is helping
 
03:37:40.910 --> 03:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
our congregate facilities with their
 
03:37:42.650 --> 03:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
outbreaks so those are you know
 
03:37:44.389 --> 03:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
outbreaks in nursing homes outbreaks at
 
03:37:46.130 --> 03:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
the county jails outbreaks at the state
 
03:37:48.950 --> 03:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
jail other settings where Healthcare
 
03:37:50.750 --> 03:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
settings where we can help them and
 
03:37:52.250 --> 03:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
provide some support on infection
 
03:37:52.260 --> 03:37:53.510 align:start position:0%
provide some support on infection
control

03:37:53.510 --> 03:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
control
 
03:37:58.130 --> 03:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
um uh practices so I will move on then
 
03:38:00.590 --> 03:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
so so I'm looking I'm looking at this
 
03:38:03.530 --> 03:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
back page of years and I see where the
 
03:38:06.469 --> 03:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
forms are uh URL
 
03:38:09.410 --> 03:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
um but I'm sure the reporting is also
 
03:38:14.510 --> 03:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:16.550 --> 03:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
with all of those
 
03:38:18.710 --> 03:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
of those do we do any flash Splash
 
03:38:22.130 --> 03:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
reporting on like STDs I think you and I
 
03:38:24.410 --> 03:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
first talked about that five years ago
 
03:38:27.170 --> 03:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
that it would be helpful to get that
 
03:38:29.690 --> 03:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
data into the hands of the people who
 
03:38:33.349 --> 03:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
might be frightened by it uh are we
 
03:38:36.590 --> 03:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
doing anything to so we are so an
 
03:38:39.229 --> 03:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
interesting fact of covid-19 is all our
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
best disease investigators are are
 
03:38:43.490 --> 03:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
veteran disease investigators were the
 
03:38:45.590 --> 03:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
ones that were redeployed to covet so
 
03:38:47.929 --> 03:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
now we're back putting those disease and
 
03:38:50.570 --> 03:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
vectors A disease investigators and
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
really doing the epidemiology of STDs
 
03:38:54.650 --> 03:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
again we've been continuing to collect
 
03:38:56.690 --> 03:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
reports because it's required for the
 
03:38:59.210 --> 03:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
healthcare agencies to tell us that and
 
03:39:01.729 --> 03:39:01.739 align:start position:0%
so you know I'm laughing because my
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
staff know that almost every chance I
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
get I like to talk about STDs you know
 
03:39:08.090 --> 03:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
I'll throw a gonorrhea in there whenever
 
03:39:09.349 --> 03:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
I can
 
03:39:11.990 --> 03:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
um so but we are seeing in all
 
03:39:14.210 --> 03:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
seriousness we've seen an increase in in
 
03:39:16.190 --> 03:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
conditions like gonorrhea which nobody
 
03:39:18.110 --> 03:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
wants and not only are we seeing
 
03:39:21.170 --> 03:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
increases but they are resistant to
 
03:39:23.570 --> 03:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
antibiotics and so you I think you'll be
 
03:39:25.010 --> 03:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
seeing more from us in a public way
 
03:39:27.170 --> 03:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
around those issues we just issued
 
03:39:30.290 --> 03:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
what's called a Han which is a a notice
 
03:39:32.090 --> 03:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
to our health care providers around some
 
03:39:34.190 --> 03:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
of those very concerning Trends yeah
 
03:39:36.710 --> 03:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay so five years later I'm still
 
03:39:39.349 --> 03:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how we get that
 
03:39:41.809 --> 03:39:41.819 align:start position:0%
information in the public Consciousness
 
03:39:44.450 --> 03:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
in a way in which it's scary enough to
 
03:39:47.389 --> 03:39:47.399 align:start position:0%
modify Behavior
 
03:39:49.550 --> 03:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
all right all right
 
03:39:51.410 --> 03:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
um so does that's that's our disease
 
03:39:53.330 --> 03:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
investigation team we can flip into
 
03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
immunization this is a hot button issue
 
03:39:57.349 --> 03:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
I know lots of folks have lots of
 
03:39:59.769 --> 03:39:59.779 align:start position:0%
thoughts and ideas around around vaccine
 
03:40:02.450 --> 03:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
it was a place where we had a huge chunk
 
03:40:05.150 --> 03:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
of this Federal money deployed to us we
 
03:40:07.910 --> 03:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know we made available monitored and
 
03:40:10.450 --> 03:40:10.460 align:start position:0%
administered over 2 million coveted 19
 
03:40:13.370 --> 03:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
vaccines since late 2020. this is
 
03:40:16.010 --> 03:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
extraordinary this is an extraordinary
 
03:40:18.650 --> 03:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
lift no matter your thought on it it was
 
03:40:21.710 --> 03:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
a lift to be able to get this done
 
03:40:23.030 --> 03:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
um can you can you hold for
 
03:40:24.429 --> 03:40:24.439 align:start position:0%
representative how
 
03:40:26.990 --> 03:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
 
03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:27.650 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
um

03:40:27.650 --> 03:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:30.889 --> 03:40:30.899 align:start position:0%
yeah 2.6 million vaccines right and a
 
03:40:33.170 --> 03:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
population of 1.3 we're now averaging
 
03:40:36.229 --> 03:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
two per person or is that also including
 
03:40:38.090 --> 03:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
ones that were not administered is that
 
03:40:40.250 --> 03:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
no those are those administered so for
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
myself I've had four vaccines you know
 
03:40:43.969 --> 03:40:43.979 align:start position:0%
I've had four administrations so you
 
03:40:46.309 --> 03:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
know I think the adult population we the
 
03:40:48.469 --> 03:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
numbers as we all know are not hard and
 
03:40:50.929 --> 03:40:50.939 align:start position:0%
fast of exactly who got how many and we
 
03:40:53.210 --> 03:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
in part that was because we did not have
 
03:40:55.250 --> 03:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
an immunization information system up
 
03:40:56.990 --> 03:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
and running in the beginning of this
 
03:40:58.910 --> 03:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
system I can tell you for sure how many
 
03:41:01.190 --> 03:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
vaccines were administered drawing it to
 
03:41:03.410 --> 03:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
the exact person who got those shots
 
03:41:05.630 --> 03:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
especially when someone like me has had
 
03:41:08.330 --> 03:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
four it gets a little bit squirrely in
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the exactness of it but we can
 
03:41:13.490 --> 03:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
tell you that adult that we that you
 
03:41:15.349 --> 03:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
know close to 70 plus probably plus
 
03:41:17.389 --> 03:41:17.399 align:start position:0%
percent of adults in New Hampshire
 
03:41:20.990 --> 03:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:22.790 --> 03:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
03:41:24.889 --> 03:41:24.899 align:start position:0%
um so you know to steal a little Thunder
 
03:41:26.750 --> 03:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
on that as well the other investment
 
03:41:28.429 --> 03:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
that the federal money helped us do was
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
to create that immunization information
 
03:41:30.479 --> 03:41:31.790 align:start position:0%
to create that immunization information
system

03:41:31.790 --> 03:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
um not only is it the registry that we
 
03:41:35.750 --> 03:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
have often heard talked about that's an
 
03:41:37.969 --> 03:41:37.979 align:start position:0%
important part of it but really for me
 
03:41:39.830 --> 03:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
what's even more important is the back
 
03:41:41.990 --> 03:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
end which is where we might we manage
 
03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
where those two million doses went how
 
03:41:45.950 --> 03:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
they're monitored were they under the
 
03:41:48.290 --> 03:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
right um temperature controls it's
 
03:41:50.330 --> 03:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
really that back end that is also part
 
03:41:51.950 --> 03:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
of the immunization information system
 
03:41:53.929 --> 03:41:53.939 align:start position:0%
that is critical for us to have
 
03:41:57.229 --> 03:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
appropriately Monitor and um make sure
 
03:41:58.670 --> 03:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
that all the vaccine is getting where
 
03:42:00.469 --> 03:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to and it's appropriate
 
03:42:02.570 --> 03:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
and we can manage the safety side of
 
03:42:05.030 --> 03:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
um we'll switch into data modernization
 
03:42:10.370 --> 03:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
and public health infrastructure I think
 
03:42:12.290 --> 03:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney has a question I'm
 
03:42:14.769 --> 03:42:14.779 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm going to want to ask you about
 
03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
our status on uh immunizing kids
 
03:42:20.870 --> 03:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
03:42:22.969 --> 03:42:22.979 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you very much uh with
 
03:42:26.050 --> 03:42:26.060 align:start position:0%
regards to this immunization money
 
03:42:28.550 --> 03:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's been a tremendous amount of
 
03:42:31.790 --> 03:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
marketing for the vaccine and for
 
03:42:34.670 --> 03:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
boosters and so forth either on Facebook
 
03:42:37.010 --> 03:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
or social media or bulletin boards and
 
03:42:39.170 --> 03:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
all this and that is there a general
 
03:42:42.349 --> 03:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
breakdown for the marketing effort for
 
03:42:44.090 --> 03:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
the covid vaccine and the follow-up
 
03:42:46.849 --> 03:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
boosters with regards to federal and
 
03:42:49.969 --> 03:42:49.979 align:start position:0%
state money sure or um I'm sure we can
 
03:42:52.790 --> 03:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
get that for you it is a component the
 
03:42:54.710 --> 03:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
communications piece and the marketing
 
03:42:57.349 --> 03:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
was a required component in a lot of our
 
03:43:00.050 --> 03:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
federal funds I can't say with certainty
 
03:43:01.729 --> 03:43:01.739 align:start position:0%
but probably pretty close to certainty
 
03:43:03.530 --> 03:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
that no General funds were used for that
 
03:43:06.170 --> 03:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
that it really were all of the marketing
 
03:43:08.929 --> 03:43:08.939 align:start position:0%
that we saw was really either State I
 
03:43:11.870 --> 03:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
mean a federal funds CDC funds or there
 
03:43:13.729 --> 03:43:13.739 align:start position:0%
were some arpa funds early in the
 
03:43:15.349 --> 03:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
beginning when you saw some of those
 
03:43:15.359 --> 03:43:16.910 align:start position:0%
beginning when you saw some of those
early

03:43:16.910 --> 03:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
early
 
03:43:19.250 --> 03:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
um you know uh marketing with the
 
03:43:21.229 --> 03:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
governor those those happened you know
 
03:43:23.690 --> 03:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
outside of Public Health per se but
 
03:43:26.510 --> 03:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
those likely used arpa funds to
 
03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
um to make those commercials and things
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
like that representable
 
03:43:34.309 --> 03:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:43:37.370 --> 03:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
looking forward or at least current is
 
03:43:39.110 --> 03:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
it possible for your department to work
 
03:43:41.330 --> 03:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
up where money is being spent in terms
 
03:43:44.750 --> 03:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
of actual vaccines right marketing those
 
03:43:48.170 --> 03:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
things as from this point forward as
 
03:43:49.610 --> 03:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
opposed to how it was spent in the past
 
03:43:52.429 --> 03:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely and we you know part of
 
03:43:52.439 --> 03:43:54.050 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely and we you know part of
the

03:43:54.050 --> 03:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:43:56.690 --> 03:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
the day is we're not sharing our entire
 
03:43:58.429 --> 03:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
budgets but you know all of this money
 
03:44:00.050 --> 03:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
has been accounted for mostly because it
 
03:44:01.969 --> 03:44:01.979 align:start position:0%
is federal funds so I can tell you very
 
03:44:04.070 --> 03:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
clearly where we have spent effort you
 
03:44:06.050 --> 03:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
know whether it's Personnel or for a
 
03:44:08.030 --> 03:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
marketing contract correct but I'm
 
03:44:10.370 --> 03:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
thinking going forward right what where
 
03:44:13.729 --> 03:44:13.739 align:start position:0%
is the plan and then can you also share
 
03:44:16.070 --> 03:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
with us what flexibility you have so the
 
03:44:17.809 --> 03:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
federal government throws some money
 
03:44:20.030 --> 03:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
over to us and then they may have
 
03:44:22.010 --> 03:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
strings attached to it more than likely
 
03:44:25.250 --> 03:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
they have strings attached to it so we
 
03:44:27.830 --> 03:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't see all of those contracts so if
 
03:44:29.630 --> 03:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
you can tell us what flexibility you
 
03:44:31.670 --> 03:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
have that would be great great and I
 
03:44:33.889 --> 03:44:33.899 align:start position:0%
will suggest that uh um with all of the
 
03:44:35.450 --> 03:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
federal funds that come they certainly
 
03:44:37.010 --> 03:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
come before joint legislative fiscal
 
03:44:39.050 --> 03:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
committee we've had lots of heated
 
03:44:40.729 --> 03:44:40.739 align:start position:0%
conversation or you know Lively
 
03:44:42.410 --> 03:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
conversation about some what's in the
 
03:44:44.450 --> 03:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
back of some of those Cooperative
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
agreements what the strings were that
 
03:44:48.229 --> 03:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
was certainly about a year and a half
 
03:44:50.090 --> 03:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
ago that we had a lot of conversation
 
03:44:51.290 --> 03:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
about that
 
03:44:54.050 --> 03:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
um but you're correct one of the tricky
 
03:44:56.990 --> 03:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
Parts about managing these more than x
 
03:44:59.210 --> 03:44:59.220 align:start position:0%
number I mean 50 grants across all of
 
03:45:01.130 --> 03:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
Public Health but you know of the 17
 
03:45:04.130 --> 03:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
accounting units that are just covid is
 
03:45:06.290 --> 03:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
that each one of them comes with a very
 
03:45:08.690 --> 03:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
clear like set of bookends of what we
 
03:45:10.729 --> 03:45:10.739 align:start position:0%
can and cannot do they are not flexible
 
03:45:12.590 --> 03:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
block grant dollars they're not flexible
 
03:45:15.590 --> 03:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
like arpa dollars
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:45:19.550 --> 03:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
so about the kids
 
03:45:22.010 --> 03:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
um I think you and I talked about this a
 
03:45:24.530 --> 03:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
couple months ago so ago when we had the
 
03:45:27.050 --> 03:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
the fiscal item to
 
03:45:30.290 --> 03:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
um a couple million dollars or so to
 
03:45:33.950 --> 03:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
help Target uh immunizations for kids
 
03:45:35.290 --> 03:45:35.300 align:start position:0%
under 18
 
03:45:39.170 --> 03:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
and at the time when we talked about it
 
03:45:41.389 --> 03:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
you know listening to all the range of
 
03:45:44.450 --> 03:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
constituents I was basically satisfied
 
03:45:48.290 --> 03:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
with where DHHS was at the point of
 
03:45:50.389 --> 03:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to use this money to
 
03:45:53.150 --> 03:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
make it available but it's all it's
 
03:45:55.370 --> 03:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
going to remain in the discretion of the
 
03:45:58.190 --> 03:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
parent have you seen any movement in the
 
03:46:00.650 --> 03:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
last two or three months for people to
 
03:46:04.670 --> 03:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
try to mandate immunizations for kids in
 
03:46:06.170 --> 03:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
this area thank you for that question
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
certainly not from the Department and it
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
is we've been very clear since the very
 
03:46:11.870 --> 03:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
beginning we have no intention to
 
03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
mandate covid-19 vaccine for school
 
03:46:16.370 --> 03:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
entry or Child Care entry that it is
 
03:46:17.389 --> 03:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
something that should be available
 
03:46:19.190 --> 03:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
families can make that decision for
 
03:46:21.710 --> 03:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
themselves based on their own risks and
 
03:46:23.450 --> 03:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
their family circumstances we want to
 
03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
make it easily available we don't want
 
03:46:26.929 --> 03:46:26.939 align:start position:0%
to make it hard to access we want to
 
03:46:28.849 --> 03:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
make it easy to access but it's the
 
03:46:30.650 --> 03:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
parents ultimate decision for covid-19
 
03:46:33.110 --> 03:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines for kids all right good answer
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:46:36.530 --> 03:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:46:39.110 --> 03:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
03:46:41.030 --> 03:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
um this is the lucky part of being the
 
03:46:44.929 --> 03:46:44.939 align:start position:0%
last one okay you have uh all asked all
 
03:46:46.729 --> 03:46:46.739 align:start position:0%
the questions you wanted so
 
03:46:48.349 --> 03:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
um data modernization and public health
 
03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to me this is this is the
 
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
thing that keeps me up at night this is
 
03:46:56.030 --> 03:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
what we need to do as we move forward
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly when the money goes
 
03:46:59.690 --> 03:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
away this is what we have to think about
 
03:47:03.290 --> 03:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
how we sustain again in a biennium away
 
03:47:05.690 --> 03:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
but it's my job to be thinking that that
 
03:47:08.570 --> 03:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
extra biennium at the end of the day
 
03:47:10.790 --> 03:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
um you know the pandemic created the
 
03:47:13.490 --> 03:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
greatest need and the best opportunity
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
to modernize the way that we collect
 
03:47:18.290 --> 03:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
data the way that we share data
 
03:47:19.969 --> 03:47:19.979 align:start position:0%
um all that's within our statutory
 
03:47:22.849 --> 03:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
Authority again through you know our our
 
03:47:24.830 --> 03:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
statutes that are this is the I posted
 
03:47:27.349 --> 03:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
on here RSA 126 that's our health
 
03:47:27.359 --> 03:47:28.630 align:start position:0%
on here RSA 126 that's our health
statistics

03:47:28.630 --> 03:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
03:47:31.309 --> 03:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
Authority but certainly through um RSA
 
03:47:35.450 --> 03:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
141c which is the communicable disease
 
03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
um so you know one of the things that
 
03:47:40.910 --> 03:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
the that kova did is really
 
03:47:43.729 --> 03:47:43.739 align:start position:0%
um the public demanded that we produce
 
03:47:47.330 --> 03:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
complete accurate timely and accessible
 
03:47:50.030 --> 03:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
and transparent information on a daily
 
03:47:52.729 --> 03:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
basis there was no other time that we've
 
03:47:55.610 --> 03:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
had that we were putting up real live
 
03:47:58.309 --> 03:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
time numbers this was a huge lift for us
 
03:48:00.590 --> 03:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm incredibly proud of the way that
 
03:48:02.809 --> 03:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
the teams work together through these
 
03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
Federal Investments to be able to show a
 
03:48:07.910 --> 03:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
covid-19 daily dashboard I think it has
 
03:48:10.070 --> 03:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
set the bar for the way that we share
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
data moving forward it was built on the
 
03:48:13.969 --> 03:48:13.979 align:start position:0%
shoulders of something we call our New
 
03:48:15.110 --> 03:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
03:48:17.570 --> 03:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
Services data portal it used to be
 
03:48:20.150 --> 03:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
called wisdom if you were around then
 
03:48:22.729 --> 03:48:22.739 align:start position:0%
um but in that case that was mostly
 
03:48:24.710 --> 03:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
annual data and that was a hard enough
 
03:48:26.990 --> 03:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
lift to constantly be updating annual
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
data and so that you could cut it and
 
03:48:32.269 --> 03:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
move it and look at it by town now the
 
03:48:34.130 --> 03:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
expectation is that more and more we
 
03:48:36.290 --> 03:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
have that data in a much more timely way
 
03:48:39.650 --> 03:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
than than annually so again this is I
 
03:48:41.750 --> 03:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
look full project forward being able to
 
03:48:43.190 --> 03:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
continue to support efforts like this
 
03:48:45.710 --> 03:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
Beyond covid is really where where I
 
03:48:49.010 --> 03:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:51.170 --> 03:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
so when I first became aware of Public
 
03:48:52.910 --> 03:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
Health as a field
 
03:48:55.429 --> 03:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
it struck me that we're trying to manage
 
03:48:58.309 --> 03:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
the health status of populations and
 
03:49:01.790 --> 03:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
that and and then what's happened is we
 
03:49:04.429 --> 03:49:04.439 align:start position:0%
have these emerging I.T Concepts around
 
03:49:08.150 --> 03:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
data warehouses and data mining and uh
 
03:49:11.090 --> 03:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
high-end analytics to start to get into
 
03:49:13.849 --> 03:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
that data and really use it and I think
 
03:49:15.830 --> 03:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
this slide that you have here on data
 
03:49:17.030 --> 03:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
modernization Public Health
 
03:49:20.090 --> 03:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
infrastructure you know it could it
 
03:49:23.150 --> 03:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
could imply the the data warehousing and
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
data analytics but it doesn't make it
 
03:49:28.330 --> 03:49:28.340 align:start position:0%
over that that's part of the strategy
 
03:49:31.429 --> 03:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
and maybe Mr Wieters is going to come
 
03:49:34.130 --> 03:49:34.140 align:start position:0%
talk to us about it but I could you just
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
tell me what you think about the
 
03:49:40.429 --> 03:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
importance of data analytics built on a
 
03:49:43.070 --> 03:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
data warehouses for the future what the
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
public health department does sure you
 
03:49:46.910 --> 03:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
know I would always defer to Mr wheaters
 
03:49:48.830 --> 03:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
to talk about the data warehouse or the
 
03:49:51.469 --> 03:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
ebi as it's called behind it which is
 
03:49:54.830 --> 03:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
EBR yeah and I am it's late in the
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon I'm blanking on that um
 
03:50:00.170 --> 03:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
yes there you go thank you I I bailed
 
03:50:03.490 --> 03:50:03.500 align:start position:0%
Nathan earlier intelligence
 
03:50:06.290 --> 03:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
he is paying it forward
 
03:50:06.300 --> 03:50:08.210 align:start position:0%
he is paying it forward
um

03:50:08.210 --> 03:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:10.010 --> 03:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
um but what I can tell you from the
 
03:50:12.889 --> 03:50:12.899 align:start position:0%
analysis I mean it's it's all the you
 
03:50:14.389 --> 03:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
know the way that I frame it's all the
 
03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
squirrels in the back of the machine
 
03:50:19.190 --> 03:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
like this is giving us the foundation of
 
03:50:21.050 --> 03:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
the information that we have so that we
 
03:50:23.269 --> 03:50:23.279 align:start position:0%
can use Vital Records where appropriate
 
03:50:25.550 --> 03:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
where we can use population data in
 
03:50:28.130 --> 03:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
order to do that deep dive of analysis
 
03:50:30.050 --> 03:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
you know as I mentioned you can look at
 
03:50:32.330 --> 03:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
our covid-19 dashboard right now and you
 
03:50:33.950 --> 03:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
know the front page or if you even look
 
03:50:36.050 --> 03:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
at slide 11 that's what you see when you
 
03:50:38.030 --> 03:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
just click on it that gives you a you
 
03:50:39.889 --> 03:50:39.899 align:start position:0%
know the quick overview of how many
 
03:50:42.290 --> 03:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
people and that you know 80 plus year
 
03:50:44.870 --> 03:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
olds have a higher number of of deaths
 
03:50:46.969 --> 03:50:46.979 align:start position:0%
than any other age group or where in the
 
03:50:49.250 --> 03:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
state there may be covid that is all
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
populated by some of that ebi as well as
 
03:50:55.070 --> 03:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
the other inputs around things like
 
03:50:58.150 --> 03:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
um in case of covid case reporting and
 
03:51:00.650 --> 03:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
laboratory reporting that comes I want
 
03:51:02.389 --> 03:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
to just jump down into the rabbit hole a
 
03:51:04.969 --> 03:51:04.979 align:start position:0%
second okay uh the data analytics it
 
03:51:06.710 --> 03:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like you think that you do
 
03:51:09.769 --> 03:51:09.779 align:start position:0%
need a data analytics function and we do
 
03:51:12.469 --> 03:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
have an analytics function right now
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry I said I I said we do
 
03:51:17.870 --> 03:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
have a pretty robust data analytics okay
 
03:51:19.969 --> 03:51:19.979 align:start position:0%
does that have to report in the public
 
03:51:21.530 --> 03:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
health area or is that under the
 
03:51:23.570 --> 03:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
informatics arm of Mr wheaters for
 
03:51:25.690 --> 03:51:25.700 align:start position:0%
Public Health
 
03:51:28.490 --> 03:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
public health statistics
 
03:51:30.769 --> 03:51:30.779 align:start position:0%
Maddox and that is where a number of our
 
03:51:33.229 --> 03:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
analyzes come from as well as within the
 
03:51:34.910 --> 03:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
individual bureaus of things like
 
03:51:36.530 --> 03:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
infectious disease as their own
 
03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
analytics and epidemiology work maternal
 
03:51:41.330 --> 03:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
and child health has their own you know
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
we have that spread throughout dphs we
 
03:51:46.969 --> 03:51:46.979 align:start position:0%
can't do our work without that analysis
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:51.120 --> 03:51:53.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:51:53.210 --> 03:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:55.070 --> 03:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry there's a question
 
03:51:56.990 --> 03:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan thanks to comment
 
03:51:58.790 --> 03:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
for your information
 
03:52:01.190 --> 03:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
these aren't labeled with numbers I know
 
03:52:03.050 --> 03:52:03.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's okay
 
03:52:05.330 --> 03:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
because you were talking about page 11 I
 
03:52:07.750 --> 03:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
was like oh
 
03:52:09.950 --> 03:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for that
 
03:52:11.389 --> 03:52:11.399 align:start position:0%
reminder I'll tell you what's on each
 
03:52:14.030 --> 03:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
one so you know
 
03:52:15.950 --> 03:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
did you have a question
 
03:52:17.090 --> 03:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
you did
 
03:52:19.790 --> 03:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
so I believe this was page 11 if I got
 
03:52:21.710 --> 03:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
your pages correctly correct thank you
 
03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
um so this is one of the several
 
03:52:27.370 --> 03:52:27.380 align:start position:0%
dashboards that are on the
 
03:52:30.410 --> 03:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
covet19nh.gov dashboard trackings page
 
03:52:30.420 --> 03:52:31.550 align:start position:0%
covet19nh.gov dashboard trackings page
correct

03:52:31.550 --> 03:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:52:33.290 --> 03:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
um who
 
03:52:35.630 --> 03:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
and what group drove the data that's
 
03:52:38.090 --> 03:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
published there and in particular I'm
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
looking at the what this is the Key
 
03:52:43.490 --> 03:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
summary tab right as opposed to the
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
front page the landing page which you
 
03:52:47.570 --> 03:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
just gave us there's information there
 
03:52:49.969 --> 03:52:49.979 align:start position:0%
that seems right that's really important
 
03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
to get out to people and I it's not
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
highlighted I'm just wondering
 
03:52:55.670 --> 03:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
who were the key decision makers and
 
03:52:57.410 --> 03:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
what ended up in that summary page
 
03:52:58.729 --> 03:52:58.739 align:start position:0%
that's a great question thank you
 
03:52:58.739 --> 03:53:00.290 align:start position:0%
that's a great question thank you
representative

03:53:00.290 --> 03:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:53:01.370 --> 03:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to go in the way back
 
03:53:03.229 --> 03:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
machine as we were trying to figure that
 
03:53:05.150 --> 03:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
out two or three years ago
 
03:53:08.269 --> 03:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
um it was it was a number of people that
 
03:53:09.290 --> 03:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
came together it was a number of
 
03:53:10.910 --> 03:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
requirements from our federal Partners
 
03:53:13.370 --> 03:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
so we're required to report these things
 
03:53:15.469 --> 03:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
federally to the CDC some of those
 
03:53:16.969 --> 03:53:16.979 align:start position:0%
breakdowns there was an interest in
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
particular around Health disparities
 
03:53:21.950 --> 03:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
among people with racial and ethnic
 
03:53:24.290 --> 03:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
um considerations that actually moved
 
03:53:25.969 --> 03:53:25.979 align:start position:0%
particularly in New Hampshire where we
 
03:53:26.990 --> 03:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
are now
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
certainly um equally if not even more
 
03:53:31.969 --> 03:53:31.979 align:start position:0%
concerned about rural populations versus
 
03:53:33.889 --> 03:53:33.899 align:start position:0%
racial and ethnic we know that there are
 
03:53:36.530 --> 03:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
age groups we in public health we look
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
at groups of people in all sorts of
 
03:53:40.190 --> 03:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
different ways and so
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
um but we also had input from all levels
 
03:53:44.450 --> 03:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
of leadership with both within the
 
03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
department in the governor's office and
 
03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
certainly uh early on the science
 
03:53:52.670 --> 03:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
um was driven by you know our state
 
03:53:55.670 --> 03:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist Dr Chan Dr Ballard and
 
03:53:58.910 --> 03:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
others all contributed to where this um
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
where we got to with this particular
 
03:54:02.750 --> 03:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
website lots of information we got a
 
03:54:04.370 --> 03:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
team of epies
 
03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
um we don't do ever anything by
 
03:54:07.610 --> 03:54:07.620 align:start position:0%
ourselves in one person by themselves at
 
03:54:09.469 --> 03:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
Public Health we takes a committee to do
 
03:54:11.389 --> 03:54:11.399 align:start position:0%
anything great thank you
 
03:54:13.429 --> 03:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
representative tolersky did you have a
 
03:54:17.030 --> 03:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:19.550 --> 03:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
says chart but that major major spike
 
03:54:22.849 --> 03:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
over the winter of 21 to 22. yep I'm
 
03:54:24.410 --> 03:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
curious if and this is something I've
 
03:54:24.420 --> 03:54:25.490 align:start position:0%
curious if and this is something I've
wondered

03:54:25.490 --> 03:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
wondered
 
03:54:28.070 --> 03:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
um when as a community we transitioned
 
03:54:30.410 --> 03:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
to self-testing and administration of
 
03:54:33.590 --> 03:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
tests I always wondered about the data
 
03:54:36.410 --> 03:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
and those numbers we see and are we just
 
03:54:38.210 --> 03:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
you know discounting all of those
 
03:54:40.490 --> 03:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
self-tests um how are you coming to that
 
03:54:42.469 --> 03:54:42.479 align:start position:0%
and does that have
 
03:54:44.510 --> 03:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
this Spike there does that have anything
 
03:54:45.950 --> 03:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
to do with the transition to
 
03:54:48.410 --> 03:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
self-testing and non-reporting sure so
 
03:54:50.570 --> 03:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that question
 
03:54:52.729 --> 03:54:52.739 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll combat your answer in sort
 
03:54:55.429 --> 03:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
of the back way so certainly since um
 
03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
all of the home-based antigen tests made
 
03:55:00.889 --> 03:55:00.899 align:start position:0%
available we knew we would never have an
 
03:55:03.410 --> 03:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
accurate number of actual cases so what
 
03:55:06.170 --> 03:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
is represented here and always has been
 
03:55:08.510 --> 03:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
represented here were laboratory
 
03:55:10.490 --> 03:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
confirmed or Health Care confirmed tests
 
03:55:11.870 --> 03:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
so if you went to your doctor's office
 
03:55:14.510 --> 03:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's who's reporting here hospitals
 
03:55:17.269 --> 03:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that's what this this
 
03:55:19.969 --> 03:55:19.979 align:start position:0%
um curve represents it's not it never
 
03:55:22.250 --> 03:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
represented what you had
 
03:55:24.349 --> 03:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
um you know with your CVS antigen test
 
03:55:27.349 --> 03:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
so that's really when early on we were
 
03:55:29.030 --> 03:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
focused on cases I mean you may even
 
03:55:30.710 --> 03:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
remember the first slide we were very
 
03:55:33.830 --> 03:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
excited in 2020 when we had five cases
 
03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
um we made a shift in during this time
 
03:55:38.389 --> 03:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
to really look at hospitalizations and
 
03:55:41.689 --> 03:55:41.699 align:start position:0%
deaths as our marker of of disease and
 
03:55:44.030 --> 03:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
concern rather than the number of cases
 
03:55:45.769 --> 03:55:45.779 align:start position:0%
because what we've also seen and I think
 
03:55:47.389 --> 03:55:47.399 align:start position:0%
folks you know you know this intuitively
 
03:55:51.050 --> 03:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
from your own families as more immunity
 
03:55:55.370 --> 03:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
came in the community there were uh less
 
03:55:58.670 --> 03:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh bad outcomes or you know the outcomes
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
were better for larger groups of people
 
03:56:02.450 --> 03:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
so we saw you know sort of
 
03:56:04.729 --> 03:56:04.739 align:start position:0%
proportionately fewer hospitalizations
 
03:56:06.590 --> 03:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
we still have plenty of hospitalizations
 
03:56:09.650 --> 03:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
but we saw both immunity naturally and
 
03:56:12.290 --> 03:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
with vaccine
 
03:56:14.450 --> 03:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
you've been waiting for me to say it you
 
03:56:18.250 --> 03:56:18.260 align:start position:0%
said it you set natural immunity
 
03:56:23.590 --> 03:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:26.570 --> 03:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
both of those things have impacted I
 
03:56:28.250 --> 03:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
mean if we remember back at that time
 
03:56:29.929 --> 03:56:29.939 align:start position:0%
that is when we had National Guard in
 
03:56:32.030 --> 03:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
our hospitals so you know it's not like
 
03:56:33.950 --> 03:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
we are still there we are not still
 
03:56:35.630 --> 03:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
there because we no longer have the
 
03:56:37.550 --> 03:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
National Guard in our hospitals you know
 
03:56:40.250 --> 03:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
we see those those indicators so that's
 
03:56:42.290 --> 03:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
why we use hospitalizations and deaths
 
03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
right now because that's really what
 
03:56:44.929 --> 03:56:44.939 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about
 
03:56:46.729 --> 03:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
does that does that answer your question
 
03:56:46.739 --> 03:56:50.210 align:start position:0%
does that does that answer your question
yes

03:56:50.210 --> 03:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:52.370 --> 03:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
um I knew we had made that transition to
 
03:56:53.929 --> 03:56:53.939 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations and death can you
 
03:56:56.210 --> 03:56:56.220 align:start position:0%
remind me on the calendar when that was
 
03:56:58.429 --> 03:56:58.439 align:start position:0%
as I look at this um I mean I think
 
03:57:00.290 --> 03:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
we've always focused on hospitalization
 
03:57:02.689 --> 03:57:02.699 align:start position:0%
and death so there wasn't a magic moment
 
03:57:04.490 --> 03:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
but it really was at the end of last
 
03:57:07.490 --> 03:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
year where we made you know where we saw
 
03:57:09.410 --> 03:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
that giant Spike but it was at the same
 
03:57:11.870 --> 03:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
time you'll you might recall we
 
03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
um the governor had us uh use some arpa
 
03:57:16.490 --> 03:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
funds to purchase antigen tests that
 
03:57:18.469 --> 03:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
were available in liquor stores like we
 
03:57:20.630 --> 03:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
were it was just at that time that
 
03:57:23.090 --> 03:57:23.100 align:start position:0%
antigen tests could roll out to the
 
03:57:25.490 --> 03:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
community and so now we certainly know
 
03:57:28.189 --> 03:57:28.199 align:start position:0%
that most people likely are at least
 
03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
testing the first time at home and then
 
03:57:32.150 --> 03:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
may have a follow-up test at a
 
03:57:33.290 --> 03:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider especially if
 
03:57:34.729 --> 03:57:34.739 align:start position:0%
they're not well
 
03:57:38.469 --> 03:57:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:41.689 --> 03:57:41.699 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm looking through your your slide
 
03:57:43.910 --> 03:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
deck and you got another report and then
 
03:57:46.910 --> 03:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
you got how ECR works yeah we can flip
 
03:57:48.170 --> 03:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
through all of that if you don't want to
 
03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
hear any of that that's fine no no I I
 
03:57:52.490 --> 03:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
just like alerting people that I I don't
 
03:57:54.349 --> 03:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know that you need to say much
 
03:57:56.210 --> 03:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
about those if people have questions
 
03:57:59.689 --> 03:57:59.699 align:start position:0%
we'll take them I I and and I'm I'm
 
03:58:02.090 --> 03:58:02.100 align:start position:0%
wondering if this one with the workforce
 
03:58:04.550 --> 03:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
foundational capabilities and data
 
03:58:06.710 --> 03:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
modernization sure that looks pretty
 
03:58:10.610 --> 03:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
intuitive Yep this really just um more
 
03:58:12.410 --> 03:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
talking about where our investments have
 
03:58:12.420 --> 03:58:13.309 align:start position:0%
talking about where our investments have
been

03:58:13.309 --> 03:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:58:14.809 --> 03:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
um from the federal government so the
 
03:58:18.050 --> 03:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
feds are saying to us especially now
 
03:58:20.030 --> 03:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
um and these are also it also represents
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
our needs you know between the two the
 
03:58:23.809 --> 03:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
feds are saying you need to build up
 
03:58:25.849 --> 03:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
your Workforce not only in those Public
 
03:58:27.889 --> 03:58:27.899 align:start position:0%
Health nurses in the laboratory but
 
03:58:29.689 --> 03:58:29.699 align:start position:0%
there are other capabilities and again
 
03:58:31.910 --> 03:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
the theme you will hear is around data
 
03:58:35.330 --> 03:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
analysis epidemiology informatics you
 
03:58:37.309 --> 03:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
know those folks are are the folks that
 
03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
we need to continue to try and attract
 
03:58:41.510 --> 03:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
um to build some of those foundational
 
03:58:43.429 --> 03:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
capabilities so we can do things like
 
03:58:45.469 --> 03:58:45.479 align:start position:0%
electronic case reporting
 
03:58:46.910 --> 03:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
um we're almost over the Finish Line
 
03:58:48.769 --> 03:58:48.779 align:start position:0%
with every with the hospitals being able
 
03:58:50.090 --> 03:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
03:58:52.010 --> 03:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
um but that that's important again
 
03:58:53.689 --> 03:58:53.699 align:start position:0%
background information that you and I
 
03:58:55.490 --> 03:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
and the public don't see every every day
 
03:58:58.969 --> 03:58:58.979 align:start position:0%
but we need to make sure our hospitals
 
03:59:01.250 --> 03:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
have the ability to report cases to us
 
03:59:03.229 --> 03:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
electronically Laboratories have the
 
03:59:05.150 --> 03:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
ability to report to us electronically
 
03:59:07.910 --> 03:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
as well straight from their ehrs that's
 
03:59:10.490 --> 03:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
the piece there it's a informatics in
 
03:59:12.889 --> 03:59:12.899 align:start position:0%
hl7 connection
 
03:59:14.210 --> 03:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
um I think the other thing that I would
 
03:59:15.830 --> 03:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
I would like to highlight is that not
 
03:59:17.990 --> 03:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
only did we buff up public Health's
 
03:59:19.370 --> 03:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
response the division of Public Health
 
03:59:21.349 --> 03:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
response we also put an extraordinary
 
03:59:23.689 --> 03:59:23.699 align:start position:0%
amount of money out into the community
 
03:59:23.699 --> 03:59:25.010 align:start position:0%
amount of money out into the community
um

03:59:25.010 --> 03:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
we put money in our regional public
 
03:59:29.170 --> 03:59:29.180 align:start position:0%
health networks
 
03:59:32.510 --> 03:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
we put them into Hospital Systems all
 
03:59:34.189 --> 03:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
our health Care Systems we develop
 
03:59:35.990 --> 03:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
strengthening around mobile Integrated
 
03:59:38.450 --> 03:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
Health that's where we work with EMS to
 
03:59:40.729 --> 03:59:40.739 align:start position:0%
do some newer ways to treat things that
 
03:59:42.290 --> 03:59:42.300 align:start position:0%
aren't even coveted related but around
 
03:59:44.210 --> 03:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
heart disease and chronic disease and
 
03:59:45.710 --> 03:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
trying to find new ways especially in
 
03:59:48.229 --> 03:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
places like the North Country to have
 
03:59:50.030 --> 03:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
additional resources available to
 
03:59:52.910 --> 03:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
individuals we've deployed an army of
 
03:59:55.130 --> 03:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
you know 20 some odd community health
 
03:59:57.229 --> 03:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
workers out into communities that have
 
03:59:59.330 --> 03:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
been able to ensure that families get
 
04:00:02.510 --> 04:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
access to health care and the social
 
04:00:05.090 --> 04:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
services they need and we've tried to
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
put in money to support our local
 
04:00:11.150 --> 04:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
providers in training and supplies
 
04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
um as well so again that's this has been
 
04:00:14.870 --> 04:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
a direction from the federal government
 
04:00:16.689 --> 04:00:16.699 align:start position:0%
but also what we've recognized
 
04:00:18.769 --> 04:00:18.779 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner had asked the
 
04:00:20.450 --> 04:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
commissioner question about our vendors
 
04:00:22.490 --> 04:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of our community
 
04:00:25.189 --> 04:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
Investments are hampered because our
 
04:00:27.530 --> 04:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
Community Partners don't have the staff
 
04:00:30.530 --> 04:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
to do the work so when we developed a
 
04:00:32.630 --> 04:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
grant and said to the cdcu we're going
 
04:00:34.550 --> 04:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
to do XYZ
 
04:00:37.670 --> 04:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of cases where we
 
04:00:39.830 --> 04:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't actually execute on what we
 
04:00:42.530 --> 04:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
said because our partner simply said I
 
04:00:43.849 --> 04:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
can't get the staff
 
04:00:45.530 --> 04:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
and so that's where we're seeing some of
 
04:00:48.590 --> 04:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
that that um trickle down
 
04:00:50.450 --> 04:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
um I I do have a question about it
 
04:00:52.790 --> 04:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
please so so so that's certainly the
 
04:00:55.490 --> 04:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
good news the other side of that coin on
 
04:00:58.670 --> 04:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
the community Investments is that we've
 
04:01:01.010 --> 04:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
created a flow of money into the
 
04:01:03.469 --> 04:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
communities that's gonna
 
04:01:07.010 --> 04:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
it's on trajectory to dry up so what
 
04:01:09.950 --> 04:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
kind of pent-up demand is going to
 
04:01:12.830 --> 04:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
remain for those resources when we
 
04:01:15.410 --> 04:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
unwind so I I think it's going to be a
 
04:01:16.969 --> 04:01:16.979 align:start position:0%
couple of things I mean we've tried to
 
04:01:19.250 --> 04:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
be thoughtful and do sort of one-time
 
04:01:20.929 --> 04:01:20.939 align:start position:0%
Investments it's why we focused on
 
04:01:23.290 --> 04:01:23.300 align:start position:0%
training that's why we focused on
 
04:01:26.030 --> 04:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
supplies you know those sorts of pieces
 
04:01:27.710 --> 04:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
there have been obvious places community
 
04:01:29.150 --> 04:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
health workers is a great example where
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
we've invested in people we don't have a
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
plan post you know in state fiscal year
 
04:01:36.469 --> 04:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
26 how those community health workers
 
04:01:39.170 --> 04:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
are going to continue to be funded will
 
04:01:40.849 --> 04:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
determine as a state whether that's
 
04:01:45.950 --> 04:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:47.870 --> 04:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
all right that's that's a big deal
 
04:01:51.110 --> 04:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's next budget I think okay
 
04:01:53.330 --> 04:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
um but you know maybe Mr White could
 
04:01:56.929 --> 04:01:56.939 align:start position:0%
start creating a list off to the side
 
04:01:59.450 --> 04:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
that says okay here here are some places
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
we need to look to see what the impact
 
04:02:05.090 --> 04:02:05.100 align:start position:0%
is on unwinding I I wouldn't make that a
 
04:02:07.790 --> 04:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
big priority in anything fancy but I I
 
04:02:09.410 --> 04:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to come back if
 
04:02:11.330 --> 04:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
I'm still around in two years to say
 
04:02:14.030 --> 04:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
okay let's let's talk about what the
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
plan is to unwind what do we need to
 
04:02:17.210 --> 04:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
worry about yeah
 
04:02:19.490 --> 04:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
yes you know our goal all along we've
 
04:02:21.229 --> 04:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
known the money is like you know
 
04:02:23.210 --> 04:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
Cinderella's pumpkin like it's gonna go
 
04:02:24.950 --> 04:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
away we knew this from the first day it
 
04:02:26.929 --> 04:02:26.939 align:start position:0%
dropped on us and so we've tried to be
 
04:02:28.670 --> 04:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
as thoughtful and conservative in that
 
04:02:30.410 --> 04:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
approach knowing that we didn't want to
 
04:02:32.450 --> 04:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
build systems we couldn't maintain
 
04:02:36.229 --> 04:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
all right uh representable thank you I'm
 
04:02:37.910 --> 04:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
looking at this page yes not page
 
04:02:39.889 --> 04:02:39.899 align:start position:0%
numbers right 18 it says the clock is
 
04:02:41.809 --> 04:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
ticking clock is ticking
 
04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
um 18 18 right and I guess so so if I
 
04:02:48.530 --> 04:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
heard you correctly right you're
 
04:02:50.330 --> 04:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
thinking about not just this budget but
 
04:02:53.210 --> 04:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
the budget the next biennium yes
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
what would be bad would be a huge step
 
04:02:59.210 --> 04:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
function on August 1st 2024 right I
 
04:03:00.290 --> 04:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
think that's the thing that we have to
 
04:03:03.290 --> 04:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
avoid so not just thinking about it in
 
04:03:04.729 --> 04:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
the next budget cycle I think we
 
04:03:06.110 --> 04:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
actually have to think about it in this
 
04:03:09.170 --> 04:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
budget cycle such that
 
04:03:09.180 --> 04:03:10.550 align:start position:0%
budget cycle such that
whatever

04:03:10.550 --> 04:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:03:14.210 --> 04:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
the necessary need is on August 1st that
 
04:03:17.630 --> 04:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
year that you've already hit that ramp
 
04:03:21.290 --> 04:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
level during the second well whatever
 
04:03:24.110 --> 04:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
the fourth half of the year of this
 
04:03:26.030 --> 04:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
budget cycle right the the January to
 
04:03:28.250 --> 04:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
June time frame in 2024 that you've
 
04:03:30.110 --> 04:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
already done those ramp Downs because
 
04:03:32.389 --> 04:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
otherwise no one likes step functions
 
04:03:33.830 --> 04:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
when it comes to labor pools right
 
04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
either up or down you can't find you
 
04:03:37.790 --> 04:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
suddenly need 30 people and you can't
 
04:03:40.010 --> 04:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
find them or you suddenly have 30 excess
 
04:03:42.050 --> 04:03:42.060 align:start position:0%
people that you need to tell them they
 
04:03:43.250 --> 04:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
need to go home and tell their wives
 
04:03:45.290 --> 04:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
they can't work here anymore
 
04:03:47.090 --> 04:03:47.100 align:start position:0%
um and both of those anomalies we'd like
 
04:03:50.929 --> 04:03:50.939 align:start position:0%
to avoid so I'd like from you some plan
 
04:03:52.670 --> 04:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
that talk that's part of this budget
 
04:03:54.769 --> 04:03:54.779 align:start position:0%
cycle that talks about what the ramp is
 
04:03:56.750 --> 04:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
to deal with this by the end of this
 
04:03:59.450 --> 04:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
biennium thank you did I say that
 
04:03:59.460 --> 04:04:00.469 align:start position:0%
biennium thank you did I say that
correctly

04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
04:04:02.269 --> 04:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
you know I loved everything you just
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
said but could you just summarize your
 
04:04:06.889 --> 04:04:06.899 align:start position:0%
last sentence of what your request is so
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
so that I I would like the department
 
04:04:11.809 --> 04:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
knowing that these funds are running out
 
04:04:15.290 --> 04:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
right July of 2024 to have a plan in
 
04:04:17.809 --> 04:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
place that's presented to us to bring us
 
04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
so you share with us what the long-term
 
04:04:22.910 --> 04:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
need is well I need 10 of these people
 
04:04:25.250 --> 04:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
to do X going forward because that's
 
04:04:27.769 --> 04:04:27.779 align:start position:0%
what we think we need that plan needs to
 
04:04:29.990 --> 04:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
be given to us as part of this budget
 
04:04:31.849 --> 04:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
cycle because I think the ramp down
 
04:04:35.450 --> 04:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
happens this time not next time I thank
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
you I really appreciate that and you
 
04:04:39.050 --> 04:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
know I'll point back to you that we have
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
been doing we've been having a dynamic
 
04:04:44.389 --> 04:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
response all along again 200 staff we're
 
04:04:46.490 --> 04:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
down to 40. you know we've been able to
 
04:04:48.290 --> 04:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
flex that
 
04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
um as much as possible because quite
 
04:04:51.769 --> 04:04:51.779 align:start position:0%
frankly it was unsustainable the work
 
04:04:53.630 --> 04:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
that we were doing was unsustainable and
 
04:04:55.250 --> 04:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
what I think what all of you are
 
04:04:57.290 --> 04:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
suggesting and we as well is that we
 
04:04:58.490 --> 04:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
need to understand what's sustainable
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
for the future and what that might cost
 
04:05:02.330 --> 04:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
and what that might look like you know
 
04:05:04.610 --> 04:05:04.620 align:start position:0%
what's what's needed and what's what is
 
04:05:06.170 --> 04:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
sustainable so I think we can work on
 
04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
that we know that um the the little bit
 
04:05:12.410 --> 04:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
of the tricky part for us is that even
 
04:05:14.929 --> 04:05:14.939 align:start position:0%
though these uh funds say they're going
 
04:05:17.330 --> 04:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
to expire in 24 we anticipate that many
 
04:05:18.410 --> 04:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
of them are going to give us an extra
 
04:05:22.250 --> 04:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
year so as we get closer we will likely
 
04:05:24.170 --> 04:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
have what's called a no-cost extension
 
04:05:26.269 --> 04:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
which is you can continue to spend down
 
04:05:28.849 --> 04:05:28.859 align:start position:0%
any funds that you did not spend in your
 
04:05:32.030 --> 04:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
Grant in the next coming year that's
 
04:05:34.010 --> 04:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
what um that's certainly what we're
 
04:05:35.689 --> 04:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
seeing already with funds that have
 
04:05:37.729 --> 04:05:37.739 align:start position:0%
already started to expire we've been
 
04:05:39.889 --> 04:05:39.899 align:start position:0%
seeing these no cost extensions for
 
04:05:42.229 --> 04:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
another year which is why
 
04:05:44.330 --> 04:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want to minimize the impact
 
04:05:47.630 --> 04:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
of what happens on August 1 and 24 but
 
04:05:50.210 --> 04:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
my hunch is we will have a number of
 
04:05:53.929 --> 04:05:53.939 align:start position:0%
resources to get us over that hump 26 is
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
really when when I'm gonna say fiscal
 
04:05:57.889 --> 04:05:57.899 align:start position:0%
year 26 is really going to be the the
 
04:05:59.870 --> 04:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
time that's different and and to your
 
04:06:01.309 --> 04:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
point we need to be planning for all of
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
I I would only ask that you share with
 
04:06:08.689 --> 04:06:08.699 align:start position:0%
us those plans right because I think
 
04:06:11.150 --> 04:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
that will be in fact part of this budget
 
04:06:14.389 --> 04:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
cycle as we start thinking about whether
 
04:06:16.670 --> 04:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
for instance maybe the I.T side needs
 
04:06:18.229 --> 04:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
more staff long term because we're
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
spending more time in energy managing
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
data than you anticipated two years ago
 
04:06:27.830 --> 04:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's an example but the laboratory
 
04:06:30.349 --> 04:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
automation side has has fundamentally
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
changed and now it's it's very much
 
04:06:33.650 --> 04:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
automated and there's less people
 
04:06:35.210 --> 04:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
actually doing tests in the lab for
 
04:06:36.769 --> 04:06:36.779 align:start position:0%
example great thank you I appreciate
 
04:06:38.990 --> 04:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
04:06:41.210 --> 04:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
so I hear the request request sounds
 
04:06:44.389 --> 04:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
rational uh I I'm just telling you as
 
04:06:46.130 --> 04:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm thinking through how we went
 
04:06:48.469 --> 04:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
through the budget last year I'm not
 
04:06:50.929 --> 04:06:50.939 align:start position:0%
exactly sure how that information would
 
04:06:53.929 --> 04:06:53.939 align:start position:0%
be conveyed in what I'm expecting to be
 
04:06:56.689 --> 04:06:56.699 align:start position:0%
are you know the high hurdles of agency
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
budget running you know but but you know
 
04:07:02.269 --> 04:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it to Mr Ripple and Mr White
 
04:07:04.670 --> 04:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
and Miss Tilly to kind of figure out how
 
04:07:07.490 --> 04:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
to how to bring us that information in
 
04:07:10.010 --> 04:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
an actionable way I I don't have a view
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
of it right now it might be Staffing
 
04:07:15.889 --> 04:07:15.899 align:start position:0%
levels anticipated Staffing levels right
 
04:07:19.010 --> 04:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
at that time right so Staffing levels
 
04:07:21.650 --> 04:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
are X today and Staffing levels we see
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
at the end of this period of time we
 
04:07:26.090 --> 04:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
think this is going to shrink down to
 
04:07:28.429 --> 04:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
this number this is going to grow
 
04:07:30.110 --> 04:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
some of that information might be
 
04:07:32.210 --> 04:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
available where you see the direction of
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
each of those departments going so if
 
04:07:36.110 --> 04:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
that can be shared even is just a high
 
04:07:38.090 --> 04:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
level document would be helpful sure
 
04:07:40.910 --> 04:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I will wrap up then it's sort
 
04:07:42.889 --> 04:07:42.899 align:start position:0%
of the almost the third to last slide
 
04:07:44.750 --> 04:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
says future Workforce Challenge and I
 
04:07:46.490 --> 04:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
think this there are no numbers here but
 
04:07:50.090 --> 04:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
this is this is getting where you want
 
04:07:52.490 --> 04:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
um it you know we currently have about
 
04:07:54.889 --> 04:07:54.899 align:start position:0%
40 to 49 positions that are these
 
04:07:57.050 --> 04:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
temporary State positions that are
 
04:07:59.389 --> 04:07:59.399 align:start position:0%
in and out of being filled
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
um the nature of temporary positions is
 
04:08:02.870 --> 04:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
even when we get somebody in them they
 
04:08:05.090 --> 04:08:05.100 align:start position:0%
know it's temporary so they tend to not
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
always stick around either so it's a lot
 
04:08:08.929 --> 04:08:08.939 align:start position:0%
of managing in and out
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
um and then we have some stack temporary
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
staffing contracts you know I don't
 
04:08:15.410 --> 04:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
think you know come that come this time
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
next year and certainly by August of of
 
04:08:20.510 --> 04:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
um the next fiscal year I don't
 
04:08:21.889 --> 04:08:21.899 align:start position:0%
anticipate we're going to be needing all
 
04:08:23.570 --> 04:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
of that but I I do know that we will
 
04:08:25.729 --> 04:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
need some of that it's probably not
 
04:08:27.410 --> 04:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
going to be that level
 
04:08:29.809 --> 04:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
um I think the areas again that I would
 
04:08:31.490 --> 04:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
tell you to forecast that we're going to
 
04:08:34.010 --> 04:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
need some infrastructure support is
 
04:08:36.830 --> 04:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
around laboratory informatics that's the
 
04:08:38.990 --> 04:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
big one emergency preparedness and
 
04:08:40.849 --> 04:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
response we've gotten you know we've
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
been able to respond for that you know
 
04:08:45.110 --> 04:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
to this with a lot of federal resources
 
04:08:48.410 --> 04:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
those resources all go away very soon to
 
04:08:50.510 --> 04:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
your point uh representative Edwards
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
data analysis and epidemiology right
 
04:08:54.650 --> 04:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
there in black and white and then of
 
04:08:56.269 --> 04:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
course you know one of the the
 
04:08:57.710 --> 04:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
Investments I think in the community
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
that has been popular is community
 
04:09:02.269 --> 04:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
health workers so I can wrap up there
 
04:09:03.889 --> 04:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
everyone's putting their stuff no that's
 
04:09:05.389 --> 04:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
a tour de force that's uh that's
 
04:09:05.399 --> 04:09:06.469 align:start position:0%
a tour de force that's uh that's
excellent

04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
04:09:09.650 --> 04:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
um are there any questions for Miss
 
04:09:13.070 --> 04:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
you'll always be Miss Tilly to me I'm so
 
04:09:16.010 --> 04:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
sorry Trisha
 
04:09:19.250 --> 04:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
Patty okay
 
04:09:23.210 --> 04:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
so uh so so no thank you for for all of
 
04:09:25.670 --> 04:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
this and uh if the members of the
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
division could just stick stick around
 
04:09:30.469 --> 04:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
for like four more minutes I'd
 
04:09:32.210 --> 04:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
appreciate it we're gonna we're gonna
 
04:09:33.889 --> 04:09:33.899 align:start position:0%
let you go
 
04:09:36.349 --> 04:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
um Mr White you've heard a lot you got
 
04:09:39.229 --> 04:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
any last minute stuff for us that you've
 
04:09:39.239 --> 04:09:40.809 align:start position:0%
any last minute stuff for us that you've
heard

04:09:40.809 --> 04:09:40.819 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
okay Mr Collins I see you back there
 
04:09:44.990 --> 04:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
you've been listening do you have
 
04:09:47.630 --> 04:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
anything for the good of the community
 
04:09:50.929 --> 04:09:50.939 align:start position:0%
all right okay so uh I'm not going to do
 
04:09:52.610 --> 04:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
this every time but since this is our
 
04:09:54.650 --> 04:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
first time and because I've been trying
 
04:09:58.610 --> 04:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
to interject some some places where the
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
folks providing us testimony would slow
 
04:10:03.950 --> 04:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
down and go into detail
 
04:10:06.650 --> 04:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
on the assumption that the new members
 
04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
of the division and the new members to
 
04:10:12.469 --> 04:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
finance May benefit from from hearing
 
04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
some of the more basic stuff I think
 
04:10:17.030 --> 04:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's cost us an extra 15-20 minutes
 
04:10:19.370 --> 04:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
today you know and the rest of it is me
 
04:10:21.950 --> 04:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
learning stuff but so I want to get your
 
04:10:26.510 --> 04:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
feedback and do I is it okay for me to
 
04:10:28.610 --> 04:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
worry about making sure that some of
 
04:10:31.250 --> 04:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
this basic training stuff is included as
 
04:10:34.070 --> 04:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
we go or would you rather me just try to
 
04:10:35.750 --> 04:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
run it faster
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it very much
 
04:10:40.670 --> 04:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
okay I do feel it's a learning process
 
04:10:42.889 --> 04:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
and if it only cost us 15 minutes then I
 
04:10:44.330 --> 04:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank the committee for giving us that
 
04:10:44.340 --> 04:10:45.110 align:start position:0%
thank the committee for giving us that
time

04:10:45.110 --> 04:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:10:45.120 --> 04:10:46.729 align:start position:0%
time
ditto

04:10:46.729 --> 04:10:46.739 align:start position:0%
ditto
 
04:10:48.349 --> 04:10:48.359 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
04:10:52.370 --> 04:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
okay good so now I have a get out of
 
04:10:54.650 --> 04:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
jail card for like holding really long
 
04:10:54.660 --> 04:10:56.809 align:start position:0%
jail card for like holding really long
meetings

04:10:56.809 --> 04:10:56.819 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:11:00.590 --> 04:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
okay so anyone at this point
 
04:11:02.570 --> 04:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
representative norgren do you have in a
 
04:11:04.849 --> 04:11:04.859 align:start position:0%
summary or anything you want to add or
 
04:11:09.170 --> 04:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:13.309 --> 04:11:13.319 align:start position:0%
oh okay uh anyone how about you Mr
 
04:11:15.349 --> 04:11:15.359 align:start position:0%

we know about Friday that we should say
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
um well you know so I think included in
 
04:11:22.550 --> 04:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
the email I sent out the other day is
 
04:11:25.010 --> 04:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
the brief list of presentations in order
 
04:11:26.630 --> 04:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
that you plan on seeing on Friday I
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't have that in front of me at the
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
moment uh I did want to point out though
 
04:11:31.550 --> 04:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
I think everybody received an email from
 
04:11:33.290 --> 04:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
Janet earlier today there's also a work
 
04:11:35.330 --> 04:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
session scheduled on Friday at 11 on
 
04:11:37.070 --> 04:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 49 so I didn't want you to
 
04:11:42.110 --> 04:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:42.120 --> 04:11:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:11:44.150 --> 04:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:11:45.950 --> 04:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
to say that again
 
04:11:50.210 --> 04:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
House Bill 49 which is uh I'm the prime
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor in that that's the that's the
 
04:11:54.290 --> 04:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
short-term extension that we were
 
04:11:56.269 --> 04:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
talking about representative walner with
 
04:11:58.910 --> 04:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
some money uh thrown at it we're gonna
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have a work session on that
 
04:12:05.090 --> 04:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
at 11 o'clock on Friday
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have a room yet do we
 
04:12:11.389 --> 04:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
um I think it's two 201 I was hoping we
 
04:12:13.849 --> 04:12:13.859 align:start position:0%
I was hoping we would get into 210 211.
 
04:12:17.330 --> 04:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:19.849 --> 04:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
and that reminds me I may be late for
 
04:12:23.389 --> 04:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
that one as we previously discussed okay
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
do you think you're gonna have an
 
04:12:28.189 --> 04:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
amendment to that or uh because I I
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
it'll work there before it's over but
 
04:12:32.090 --> 04:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
but no I don't have any plans for that
 
04:12:33.410 --> 04:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
but I do think I'll get that before it's
 
04:12:36.429 --> 04:12:36.439 align:start position:0%
over I just might be a little bit late
 
04:12:40.189 --> 04:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
okay so if anyone has an amendment to HP
 
04:12:42.889 --> 04:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
49 even if it's just in a Word document
 
04:12:45.410 --> 04:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
that we could look at and talk about I I
 
04:12:48.110 --> 04:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
think you know given the
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
urgency of the sununu Center closing
 
04:12:52.849 --> 04:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
rapidly I I just would really like us to
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
do what we could to
 
04:12:57.229 --> 04:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
um not to not to foreclose what the
 
04:12:59.769 --> 04:12:59.779 align:start position:0%
decision ought to be but to try to
 
04:13:03.950 --> 04:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
accelerate a good discussion
 
04:13:06.670 --> 04:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
um anything else they're miserable
 
04:13:08.929 --> 04:13:08.939 align:start position:0%
do you do we know enough to talk about
 
04:13:15.410 --> 04:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:17.570 --> 04:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
I think there's going to be
 
04:13:20.030 --> 04:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
a full committee public hearing on Two
 
04:13:21.950 --> 04:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
Bills the morning of the ninth one is
 
04:13:23.450 --> 04:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
Senate bill one and the other one is
 
04:13:24.610 --> 04:13:24.620 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:13:28.010 --> 04:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
257 I believe and then following those
 
04:13:30.050 --> 04:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
public hearings there will be a division
 
04:13:33.650 --> 04:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
three work session on
 
04:13:35.870 --> 04:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
at a minimum Senate bill one I think for
 
04:13:37.610 --> 04:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
calendar purposes Janice is going to put
 
04:13:39.650 --> 04:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
in all three bills that are currently in
 
04:13:41.929 --> 04:13:41.939 align:start position:0%
division so Senate bill one house bill
 
04:13:45.050 --> 04:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
49 and House Bill 257. and what you end
 
04:13:46.969 --> 04:13:46.979 align:start position:0%
up working on you end up working on but
 
04:13:48.769 --> 04:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
at least they'll all be calendared and
 
04:13:50.990 --> 04:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
then once that work session is complete
 
04:13:52.969 --> 04:13:52.979 align:start position:0%
I think the
 
04:13:55.130 --> 04:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
the expectation is that there will be a
 
04:13:57.050 --> 04:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
full committee exec session on Senate
 
04:13:58.370 --> 04:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
bill 1.
 
04:14:00.769 --> 04:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
that afternoon
 
04:14:00.779 --> 04:14:02.750 align:start position:0%
that afternoon
okay

04:14:02.750 --> 04:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:14:05.570 --> 04:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
yes the room isn't available on the 8th
 
04:14:06.950 --> 04:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's a Wednesday so Health and Human
 
04:14:08.750 --> 04:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
Services has the room
 
04:14:12.050 --> 04:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
oh oh okay so in anticipate I think
 
04:14:14.330 --> 04:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
it'll start at 10 o'clock
 
04:14:16.490 --> 04:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:14:18.769 --> 04:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
um so in anticipation of any concern
 
04:14:23.570 --> 04:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
about the the moving on sb1 so quickly
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
after a work session of division three
 
04:14:29.330 --> 04:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
next week I just would point out that by
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
the time we talk on Friday about HP 49
 
04:14:37.370 --> 04:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
an amendment I've had drafted uh we we
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
will have us we will have covered all of
 
04:14:43.490 --> 04:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
the ground that's in sb1 so so it's
 
04:14:44.809 --> 04:14:44.819 align:start position:0%
almost like we're going to have two
 
04:14:47.389 --> 04:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
bytes of the Apple in terms of the
 
04:14:50.689 --> 04:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
issues and you'll have time to spend the
 
04:14:52.969 --> 04:14:52.979 align:start position:0%
weekend thinking about it and before we
 
04:14:55.309 --> 04:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
come back to sb1 you'll have plenty of
 
04:14:57.110 --> 04:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
time to think about it on a relative
 
04:15:00.349 --> 04:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
scale I think so that that that's what
 
04:15:02.809 --> 04:15:02.819 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm thinking I I the only thing I'm
 
04:15:06.110 --> 04:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
losing sleep over these days is uh what
 
04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
happens on one March when the sununity
 
04:15:10.130 --> 04:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
center is legally required to close
 
04:15:12.410 --> 04:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing I will lose sleep
 
04:15:12.420 --> 04:15:13.250 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing I will lose sleep
over

04:15:13.250 --> 04:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:15:18.650 --> 04:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
so uh any anybody uh representative hole
 
04:15:20.990 --> 04:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
can someone explain to me what the plan
 
04:15:22.849 --> 04:15:22.859 align:start position:0%
is for Friday in terms of hearings
 
04:15:24.229 --> 04:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
because I heard an overlap I just want
 
04:15:25.610 --> 04:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand and I haven't
 
04:15:27.769 --> 04:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
gotten through all the we're talking
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
Friday the third uh yes yes you want to
 
04:15:32.570 --> 04:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
do that Mr Ripple
 
04:15:34.729 --> 04:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
sure so there'll be a work session on
 
04:15:37.070 --> 04:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 49 in the morning at 11 A.M
 
04:15:41.870 --> 04:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
and then at 1 pm you'll be back for uh
 
04:15:43.250 --> 04:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
some more presentations from the
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
department and I think I sent her out an
 
04:15:47.210 --> 04:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
email earlier with that tentative
 
04:15:49.790 --> 04:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
schedule thank you I just saw our
 
04:15:58.309 --> 04:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:01.250 --> 04:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
so without seeing any other questions or
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
discussion this is sort of a good of the
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
community session here uh we can we can
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead and close I don't see a need to
 
04:16:10.729 --> 04:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
do one of these after Action reviews
 
04:16:13.490 --> 04:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
every time but I just since this is our
 
04:16:15.830 --> 04:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
first one I wanted to make sure that we
 
04:16:18.769 --> 04:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
were just in sync with each other with
 
04:16:26.990 --> 04:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:27.000 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
