00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
the only reason I'm delaying is that uh
 
00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 align:start position:0%
YouTube is not up and spinning yet so I
 
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we keep the
 
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
public in the loop they'll start it once
 
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
you once you open the meeting
 
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
chicken and egg okay all right so it's a
 
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
little past 10 o'clock
 
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
um division three work session is uh is
 
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
now open
 
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
um if uh for those of you who have
 
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
looked into the calendar uh you'll see
 
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
that we have time this morning to where
 
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to do the division of
 
00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services and then at one
 
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
o'clock it says that we're going to do a
 
00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
work session on HB 527 okay so so my my
 
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
concept of of what we're going to end up
 
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
doing here today is that we're going to
 
00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
hear from the department and from some
 
00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 align:start position:0%
uh some interest groups about rate
 
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
setting and what kind of recommendations
 
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
they have for the coming budget year as
 
00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 align:start position:0%
you know the the governor initiated the
 
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
discussions around a across the board
 
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent a Medicaid increase and in
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
his verbal remarks pointed out that he
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
was open to us moving some money around
 
00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
to Target things a little bit better so
 
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
so today is about our listening our not
 
00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
making any commitments but our coming to
 
00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.289 align:start position:0%
making any commitments but our coming to
understand

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
where the department may lead us to
 
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
believe that we have some potential
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
flexibility in how we prioritize one
 
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
service over another
 
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 align:start position:0%
and while we're doing that
 
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 align:start position:0%
for those of you that have looked at HB
 
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
527 it's a pretty narrow very specific
 
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.430 align:start position:0%
527 it's a pretty narrow very specific
bill

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
it touch it's it's an example of a great
 
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.909 align:start position:0%
it touch it's it's an example of a great
many

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
services for which a Medicaid rate
 
00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
increase is being requested and so my
 
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
hope is that we will look at
 
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
the recommendation of 527 and the
 
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
broader context of what the department
 
00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
has to present so that we have a
 
00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 align:start position:0%
holistic view of what 527 means I I
 
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
would not be surprised if we ended up
 
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
incorporating whatever we choose to do
 
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
ultimately into the budget process and
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
and then that way we would be able to
 
00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 align:start position:0%
dispose of the bill 527 while we still
 
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
addressed its content and then after
 
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
that at two o'clock we've got the dcyf
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
that is also going to be talking to us
 
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 align:start position:0%
so so there's a lot to do today I I
 
00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
don't know if we're going to be able to
 
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
get to it all
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
um and uh so let's go ahead and get
 
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
good morning Nathan white Chief
 
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer with the Department of
 
00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record Henry
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
and as a chairman Edwards already
 
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
indicated we will be presenting on the
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
division of Medicaid services this
 
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
morning and before you you should have
 
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
the budget briefing book for the
 
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
division of Medicaid services and then
 
00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
you will also have the presentation that
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
we will be covering this morning and so
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
with that I will hand it over to Henry
 
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
so so I flip through this what what page
 
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
um well we were going to start with the
 
00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 align:start position:0%
with the presentation oh the
 
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
understanding the time that you're
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
trying to work through I'm not going to
 
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
read every slide I'm going to try to
 
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
highlight some points on the various
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
slides here
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
um so on beginning on uh slide two under
 
00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 align:start position:0%
the mission just would highlight as many
 
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
might recognize there are more people on
 
00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
Medicaid today than ever before in New
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but even with that
 
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
nationally as of October was the latest
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
statistics New Hampshire had the fourth
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
lowest enrollment in Medicaid in the
 
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.409 align:start position:0%
lowest enrollment in Medicaid in the
country

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:29.419 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:34.460 align:start position:0%
today it's about one in 5.5 individuals
 
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
nationally it runs anywhere between one
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
turning to slide three at the top I
 
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
think you know distinguishing you know
 
00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:51.419 align:start position:0%
Medicare from Medicaid but in the
 
00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:54.419 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program today we're just above
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
250 000 as of the end of January it was
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
just under
 
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
um and then I think in terms of the
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
division of Medicaid services we sort of
 
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
have two functions if you will in the
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
department one is sort of like the
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
health insurance program that you're
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
familiar with the other is sort of being
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
the the connection with CMS in terms of
 
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
all the waivers and state plans and
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
assisting other divisions with the
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities to draw Medicaid funds as
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to having to use General funds
 
00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:27.419 align:start position:0%
from the state and there's a list there
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to as long as you're on that 250
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
on page three yes after we get done with
 
00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
the wind down what's what's the
 
00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
anticipated participation level I have a
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
slide on that but we're in terms of by
 
00:08:47.769 --> 00:08:47.779 align:start position:0%
the end of this calendar we're
 
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
anticipating that about just under 59
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
000 will be subtracted from this uh
 
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
number and then eventually over another
 
00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
year because some people who are newer
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
to the program have a year to of
 
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
Eligibility before their subject to uh
 
00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
um doing a redetermination of their
 
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
eligibility so we're expecting that by
 
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
December we'll have I'm seeing a drop of
 
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.889 align:start position:0%
December we'll have I'm seeing a drop of
about

00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:12.899 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
um 59 000 and I'll have a few slides
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
that get into that in more detail okay
 
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.670 align:start position:0%
that get into that in more detail okay
question

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much can you just wear
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
the fourth lowest in the nation can you
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
just give us some background on why that
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
is is it because we're doing that much
 
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
better than the rest of the nation or
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
because it's a lack of knowledge of the
 
00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
of the system
 
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
I would
 
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
um if you look at it broadly New
 
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy is stronger than
 
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
um you know at the other end of the
 
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
spectrum Mississippi New Mexico
 
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
communities that have a lot higher
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of poverty tend to have a
 
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
much higher level of enrollment that
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
while Medicaid is largely a categorical
 
00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
program income does come in in terms of
 
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
Eligibility and assets and so New
 
00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:04.019 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know overall has had a
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
lower than average for a long time it's
 
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:09.500 align:start position:0%
actually in some categories for example
 
00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
children New Hampshire's eligibility is
 
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
higher than some states in terms of
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
allowing children to to qualify for the
 
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
program so I think it's a function of
 
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
welcome representative nordgren how are
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry do we have a question over
 
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
here I do uh and yeah definitely it's
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
nice to have you back too
 
00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:42.170 align:start position:0%
nice to have you back too
um

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned that we're fourth lease
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
do you have any comments about the
 
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
intensity and breadth of services uh
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
dollars per per uh Medicaid recipient
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
and how that compares to other states so
 
00:10:56.449 --> 00:10:56.459 align:start position:0%
I think when you've seen one Medicaid
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
Program you've seen one Medicaid Program
 
00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:00.899 align:start position:0%
as part of the the function but I guess
 
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
in terms of the way I would Express it
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
is that against the president's Trend if
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with with that and um
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh on B budgeting at a at a federal
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
level that we've consistently come under
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
that Trend in terms of our increase in
 
00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:20.660 align:start position:0%
spending I think function also of
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
certain categories relative to the
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
supply of providers you know New
 
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has historically not been a
 
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.670 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has historically not been a
um

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
over bedded or an over provided state so
 
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
some of that factors into what the cost
 
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
looks like and also just New England
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
with heating costs and other things and
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
the labor markets just is a little bit
 
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
more expensive place to do business
 
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.710 align:start position:0%
more expensive place to do business
generally

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh are are you saying there may be more
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
need than we're we're able to service
 
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
um keeping the spend down a bit
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
um there I guess in terms of appropriate
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
utilization I think what we're seeing in
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
some and why the I think the chair was
 
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
talking before the meeting began about
 
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339 align:start position:0%
you know the uh stakeholders who are
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
interested in further rate increases I
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
um there are areas of the program
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
um for example home care where there are
 
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
shortages of personnel and where we're
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
not able to deliver 100 of the if you
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
will documented hours of care that might
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
be needed
 
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously in the the mental
 
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
health space that is you know prominent
 
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
in the news that there's a shortage of
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
Workforce here
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
um that's comparable and some other
 
00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:41.339 align:start position:0%
places but part of the the
 
00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:43.019 align:start position:0%
thing that we're tracking is sort of
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic levels of utilization
 
00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:47.459 align:start position:0%
versus where we are today we're still
 
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
not back to where we were in 2019
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
in some categories
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
so I like to try to keep things simple
 
00:12:59.810 --> 00:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
just to make sure I'm understanding them
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
and and so that the public if they're
 
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
watching can follow along
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
um so our utilization is tied to a
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
couple of things one the amount of money
 
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
that we're putting into the system to to
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
to purchase supplies and capability and
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
then the other the number of people who
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
work in the field and that and that so
 
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
it is possible for us to put
 
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
more money into the system and still yet
 
00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:31.139 align:start position:0%
have a limitation built in on
 
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
utilization because
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
we don't have the people to provide the
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
services is is that is that a possible
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
outcome of of a policy decision we might
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
end up making here
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
I wish it was that simple it's a little
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
bit more complicated than that and so as
 
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
an example you know part of utilization
 
00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:55.019 align:start position:0%
is driven by the the demographic Trends
 
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
in the state you know in terms of the
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
older we get the the more utilization
 
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
um you know services like maternity they
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
can vary too in terms of what the birth
 
00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:07.139 align:start position:0%
rate is and um you know inba in
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
migration out migration in the state but
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of looking at in the short term
 
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
you know looking at basically the
 
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
utilization that's potentially
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
out there to be had like in outpatient
 
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
or home care or some of the other
 
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:27.740 align:start position:0%
ones where we have severe shortages of
 
00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
capacity you know I think that that
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
you're right on on those points but I
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
think it gets to be a little bit more
 
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
complicated like one of the major areas
 
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
of the Medicaid budget that's growing is
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
in Pharmacy
 
00:14:44.449 --> 00:14:44.459 align:start position:0%
um Pharmacy is is now the second largest
 
00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:47.339 align:start position:0%
expenditure and I can tell you
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
um on the
 
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
on the horizon in terms of the types of
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
therapies that are available you know
 
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
one that we've had happen already is a
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
therapy called zolgensma which uh just
 
00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
the dose of the the uh
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
it's a gene therapy actually the dose of
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
the gene therapy costs 2.4 million not
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
to mention the hospitalization and other
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
things that go around it so some of what
 
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
is out there to come in terms of Gene
 
00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.019 align:start position:0%
therapies and the like are you know
 
00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
they're relatively rare but we've had
 
00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
instances of those occur and that's in
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
terms of driving the budget in the
 
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
future that's that's an area that isn't
 
00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
so much necessarily driven by any of
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
those factors but by science and what's
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.610 align:start position:0%
 
huh

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
huh
 
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
just continuing on slide four one of the
 
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
things I
 
00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:50.339 align:start position:0%
um mentioned a Health and Human Service
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
oversight on Friday is I think taking a
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
broader view of Medicaid Medicaid I
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
think is part of a policy solution in
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
um you know I already covered that with
 
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
a fourth lowest population but part of
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
the functioning of our insurance markets
 
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
is a function of the risk that's there
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
to underwrite and so
 
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:13.100 align:start position:0%
um by the move that was made
 
00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:17.339 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 to bring the expansion
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
population into back into the Medicaid
 
00:16:23.689 --> 00:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
Managed Care Program it it affected the
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
individual Market
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
um and in that space if you look at the
 
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:31.100 align:start position:0%
footnote at the bottom
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had the lowest Benchmark
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
premium in the United States in 2022 and
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
we were the number one in terms of the
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of employer sponsored
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
coverage in in the United States
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
so I think in terms of the the health of
 
00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:48.779 align:start position:0%
the the market if you will I know
 
00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:50.459 align:start position:0%
insurance is expensive not trying to
 
00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:52.259 align:start position:0%
Discount that but on a relative basis
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
those are two good indicators
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
um another one I would um highlight is
 
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
that uh the number of people working in
 
00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:02.339 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
um that are on Medicaid has increased
 
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
since 2019 we're up to 70 percent that
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
are working to some level
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
um we were we're higher than the
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
national average in that as well and so
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
I think in blue there what I'm the
 
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
conclusion I draw is that the
 
00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:20.459 align:start position:0%
combination of what the insurance
 
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
department has done with their 1332
 
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
waiver by moving the expansion
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
population back into the Medicaid
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
Managed Care Program you know it has put
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
us in a better position as a state to
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
so that that's that was sort of a eye
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
level thing and pausing on on page
 
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
five here um I know some people are
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
um uh have had less interaction with the
 
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
Department on on Medicaid so I wanted to
 
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
pause here in terms of if there were any
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
of these topics on page five that
 
00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
anybody would like a little sort of
 
00:17:59.570 --> 00:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
background before diving into the rest
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
of the the presentation
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
so so thank you for that invitation and
 
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
I I just would want to re-emphasize that
 
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
for the folks who are newer to the
 
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
division three and to Health Care this
 
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
is really your opportunity to just say
 
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
hey this looks interesting let's talk
 
00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:24.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you both for being
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
here the question regarding chip how
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
does that relate to other programs for
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
instance New Hampshire Healthy Kids and
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
the like
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
so I think New Hampshire Healthy Kids
 
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
the predecessor program to
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
um what is children's coverage today I
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
think there was an advantage at not sure
 
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
the year before my time back a number of
 
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
years ago that there was an advantage
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
from a financing standpoint to move the
 
00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
children's population that was formerly
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
under healthy kids within back within
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program itself and so that
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
coverage is embedded in um and will be
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
in 47 10 705 one this is where we'll
 
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:11.220 align:start position:0%
talk about the children's health
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
thank you could you touch on what the
 
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
state phase down
 
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
is sure that that one's a
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
um an interesting one an interesting one
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
when we get to it on the budget sheet so
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
going back maybe more than a decade in
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
terms of people who are what we call
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
dual eligible both have Medicaid in
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
Medicare that the state has some
 
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059 align:start position:0%
responsibility to pick up part of their
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
prescription drug costs and each year
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
the federal government publishes
 
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
typically around October what the rate
 
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
is for the next year and so
 
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
um when we get to that section one of
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
the things it's a fairly straightforward
 
00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
calculation our rate is I think
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
233.44 cents for the next year time
 
00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:04.940 align:start position:0%
multiplied times the number of
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
individuals that we expect to be having
 
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
to pay for which is approximately a
 
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
little over nineteen thousand
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
um and that's how we arrive at the
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
number that's been an area of the budget
 
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
that last session in this session we
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
haven't quite penetrated through in
 
00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:24.419 align:start position:0%
terms of how this number is budgeted and
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
we had a shortage over what is in the
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
the agency compared to the governor's
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
budget of about 15 million over the
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
biennium on that account and
 
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
historically we've had to make it up
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
and and and and just her context in 22
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
um we came about eight million dollars
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
short that we had to transfer to cover
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
that we're projecting a similar uh
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
looks like you can continue no other
 
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.090 align:start position:0%
looks like you can continue no other
questions

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
so um the the next uh page is sort of
 
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.450 align:start position:0%
so um the the next uh page is sort of
um

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
I guess almost like a table of contents
 
00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:06.299 align:start position:0%
I know we want to go through next the
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
the budget briefing book but here again
 
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
is another menu of where you might want
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
us to we can go in any order you'd like
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
because we kind of organized it so that
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
we can pivot around where you'd like to
 
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
to go next but I think if
 
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
if there are any more background
 
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.370 align:start position:0%
if there are any more background
questions

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:21.380 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539 align:start position:0%
so I'll tell you what I'm chomping at
 
00:21:27.549 --> 00:21:27.559 align:start position:0%
the bit to see your spreadsheet on
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
current and proposed Medicaid rates and
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
what the financial impact of moving
 
00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
money around would be that that's where
 
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
my head's at today I mean
 
00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
can we do that or I know I'm going to
 
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
ask you to fast forward through a lot of
 
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
this uh is there something in here
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's foundational to us to get into
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
that I think one of the the areas that I
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
think is important to understand
 
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
not only from a budget standpoint but
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
from a constituent standpoint what's
 
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
happening with the the unwind and how
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
we're preparing for that
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
um I would like I know you got a good
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
dose of it at uh at Health and Human
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
Service oversight but um I know
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
um with you know 58 000 or more uh maybe
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
close to 60 000 people
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
um who are going to be losing Medicaid
 
00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.010 align:start position:0%
um who are going to be losing Medicaid
that

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
um that's our estimate anyways that that
 
00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:21.299 align:start position:0%
you'll I'm expecting that will lead to
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
interact to help consumers which slide
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
would you like us on oh um could we go
 
00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
through the briefing book first I'm
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
really trying to get to your Excel
 
00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:33.059 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet on categories and proposed
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
and existing rates that that's
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:40.940 align:start position:0%
um so maybe if we've got a slide 43
 
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
representative walner has a question
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
I know you're anxious to get to a
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
certain spreadsheet but I I think it
 
00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
would be helpful if we could have Mr let
 
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
me go through his presentation we do
 
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
have new people here
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
and I mean for myself I even don't
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
really remember all of this so just I
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
think it would be helpful to do that and
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
then we'll we'll get to the spreadsheet
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I'll I'll be judicious on time
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
if that's the way you want me to go yeah
 
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it's all written here and we
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
can ask follow-up questions via email
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
and to ask you back for things we don't
 
00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%
understand so so yeah go ahead and and
 
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
let's let's do the foundational stuff
 
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
so we'll come back to the briefing but
 
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.669 align:start position:0%
so we'll come back to the briefing but
okay

00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
so I I'll skip over the
 
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
so let me start with um slide
 
00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:51.890 align:start position:0%
so let me start with um slide
and

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.370 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
so one of the things
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
um we're pleased to be able to report
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
um has been working on the department
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
has been working on preparing for this
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
unwind since July of 2020.
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
um I think there are press accounts over
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
the weekend that cited New Hampshire as
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
able to begin its unwind among the
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
earliest among states where we're able
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
to begin with actually disenrollment of
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
people who aren't eligible beginning
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
April some states are taking to July we
 
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
also have an indication that unlike some
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
other states we don't have to have a
 
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:36.539 align:start position:0%
mitigation plan because our eligibility
 
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
system and our systems of doing things
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
we had unlike some states we also never
 
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:43.700 align:start position:0%
stopped doing our business
 
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
we work with people on a voluntary basis
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
saying you know it makes sense to to do
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
your redetermination and we got over 32
 
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
000 people to do it on a voluntary basis
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
and we had the number in the slide deck
 
00:24:59.450 --> 00:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
says 2000 in the middle on page 10 in
 
00:25:01.149 --> 00:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
terms of people no longer
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
needing Medicaid they're telling us you
 
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
know I've got something else that's now
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
up to 2 400. so we've been proactive to
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
try to get some of the work done ahead
 
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
um and uh We've also in terms of
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
you know while we talk about the
 
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
disenrollment we you know the key thing
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to do from a messaging
 
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
standpoint internally and with the
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
public is that if you're eligible for
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid the reason we did all this
 
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
advanced work we want to make sure
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
people who are eligible don't lose
 
00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
coverage and so we're making extra
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
efforts there and on the last one we've
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
been working with the insurance
 
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
department with
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
um the federal government's consumer
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
information Insurance oversight provided
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
in fact we have created a pilot with
 
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
them to individuals who are over income
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
who might otherwise not do anything they
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise would typically like a dead
 
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
letter they would they wouldn't go
 
00:25:54.769 --> 00:25:54.779 align:start position:0%
anywhere so we've got a mechanism to
 
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
send them back to them so that if they
 
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
can qualify for another source of
 
00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.750 align:start position:0%
can qualify for another source of
coverage

00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and we were the first state in the
 
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
country to to come up with that
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
um so that that's slide 10 slide 11. can
 
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
you pause or representative hole has a
 
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair so looking at
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
bullet point two right of the 32 000 and
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
now 2 400 individuals
 
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:21.419 align:start position:0%
does that number include or not include
 
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
let's say those who passed away and what
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
does that leave is total enrollment
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
still remaining
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
So today we're at about 250 000
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
individuals this wouldn't include
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
anybody that passed away this is just
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
people who on a voluntary basis
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
completed their redetermination so our
 
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
we can disenroll people who've passed
 
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
away or who let us know they've moved to
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
another state and our numbers all
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
reflect that
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
um in terms of from last session on page
 
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.710 align:start position:0%
um in terms of from last session on page
11

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
11
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
um you know this
 
00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
this committee and the Health and Human
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
Service and elderly Affairs
 
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
passed the adult Dental benefit we're on
 
00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:09.059 align:start position:0%
track to make April 1st we still have to
 
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
meet the mandatory requirement and of
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
having all the sign offs from CMS we
 
00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
believe that we're going to make those
 
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
and be able to start April 1.
 
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:17.990 align:start position:0%
and be able to start April 1.
um

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh in and out Medicaid that
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
was something that the eligibility
 
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
limits hadn't been touched in more than
 
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
a decade those were to be implemented by
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
January 1 we did so we also implemented
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
the rate increases that were passed into
 
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
the law last session to help maternity
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
care at hospitals and birthing centers
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
moving to slide 12 waivers up the we've
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
had a substance use disorder waiver
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
basically the substance use disorder and
 
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
what we described as SMI severely
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
mentally ill what this allows the state
 
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
to do is to claim Federal match where we
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise wouldn't have been able to to
 
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.409 align:start position:0%
otherwise wouldn't have been able to to
support

00:28:05.409 --> 00:28:05.419 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
those services that are on an inpatient
 
00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
basis with the understanding that we
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
would use the the money that we sort of
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
free up to continue to make sure that
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
we're not replacing our community-based
 
00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:18.299 align:start position:0%
services which the state has been
 
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
investing inevidently over the past
 
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
couple of sessions that that we have to
 
00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
prove that we're you know not trying to
 
00:28:29.289 --> 00:28:29.299 align:start position:0%
institutionalize people and I think we
 
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
received the sud component in 18 an
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that included the the the
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
mental health in in 2020 and we're have
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
an extension uh that is under
 
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
consideration another point of that one
 
00:28:47.169 --> 00:28:47.179 align:start position:0%
is uh as as County delegation
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
individuals who'd be interested in is
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
that CMS is now issued or is about to
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
issue guidance that allows for Medicaid
 
00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
to pick up some expenses for
 
00:29:00.169 --> 00:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
incarcerated individuals in the
 
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
pre-release period we had asked for an
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
option of that and I think eventually
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to offer that to support
 
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
people re-entry successfully as well as
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
will be some I think help to the cost
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
that's incurred by our correction system
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
both at a state and county level
 
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.190 align:start position:0%
both at a state and county level
ultimately

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
moving to slide 13 in terms of Staffing
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
last time last time I came before you
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
for Budget we had 100 vacancy even our
 
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
eight positions in in mmis we've been
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
able to fill six of those positions
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
which is an accomplishment I believe in
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
this in this world and then you know
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
basically our our staffing is a we have
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of specialized position and
 
00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes it takes us a number of months
 
00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
to fill positions and Key Personnel
 
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:54.539 align:start position:0%
right now I need to fill a deputy
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
director position than the person who
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
does my state plans or two vacancies
 
00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:00.419 align:start position:0%
that I have there kind of specialized
 
00:30:00.419 --> 00:30:02.930 align:start position:0%
that I have there kind of specialized
situations

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
um moving to slide 14 and 15
 
00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh these are just uh a couple of slides
 
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
that if you want to look at different
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
attributes of the New Hampshire program
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
versus the United States
 
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
and again in the interest of time I'll
 
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.350 align:start position:0%
and again in the interest of time I'll
um

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
I'll uh go I'll not go over this in
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
detail but just maybe highlight that if
 
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
you compare
 
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:29.269 align:start position:0%
you compare
um

00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:32.820 align:start position:0%
on page 14 sort of the second section
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility levels
 
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
the United States for children the the
 
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
eligibility level is 255 percent in New
 
00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's 323 percent
 
00:30:45.889 --> 00:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
um you know for pregnant women we're a
 
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
little bit lower than the national
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
average by four percent in eligibility
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
but the rest of them are pretty
 
00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
consistent with the national average but
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
I think it just reflects the importance
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
of kids in in the culture of New
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
 
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
go ahead so is it possible to get the
 
00:31:06.529 --> 00:31:06.539 align:start position:0%
data that's shown on slides 14 and 15
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
relative to comparing New Hampshire
 
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
versus the rest of the U.S comparing
 
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
showing it as bar graphs relative to all
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
the other states it's not necessarily
 
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
a fair comparison to take us and compare
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
us to let's say the southern states
 
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
or states that aren't as had enjoy such
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
high employment
 
00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
I think um there this uh particular
 
00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
chart I can send a link to the committee
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
that you can pull down any state in the
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
country and do a comparison if that
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
would that would be great thank you okay
 
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
and the disclaimer here this is not this
 
00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:45.539 align:start position:0%
is not New Hampshire's data this is data
 
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
that was aggregated by the Kaiser Family
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
Foundation and some of the underlying
 
00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:54.299 align:start position:0%
data may not be as accessible as it
 
00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
question represents stream
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
um in the table with comparing to the
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level like seniors it's
 
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
they have to be three quarters of the
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level to even be
 
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
eligible is that what this says in in
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
certain categories I think the
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
eligibility pieces
 
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
we could spend quite a bit of time on
 
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
that and I have someone who's a subject
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
matter expert on that but in certain
 
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:27.539 align:start position:0%
areas just I think
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
being older without any other condition
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
um slide
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
16 and 17 are
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
two ways of looking
 
00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:49.700 align:start position:0%
at enrollment this one slide is updated
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
through February 13th and the the pivot
 
00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:57.059 align:start position:0%
point on the left hand side of the graph
 
00:32:58.810 --> 00:32:58.820 align:start position:0%
on page 16
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
is where we began when things began to
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
come into place with respect to
 
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.310 align:start position:0%
come into place with respect to
um

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:10.140 align:start position:0%
the president's order at the time in
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
terms of the public health emergency and
 
00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:15.980 align:start position:0%
and all that you can see that
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
continuous enrollment has led to a lot
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
the largest increases in the granted
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
um 86 and a half percent and if kind of
 
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059 align:start position:0%
the spike on that right was if you
 
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
remember there was a short time where
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
unemployment New Hampshire spiked up to
 
00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:33.779 align:start position:0%
17 in some places 25 percent and
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
individuals who became eligible in that
 
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
period due to the continuous enrollment
 
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
requirements to draw the additional
 
00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:43.100 align:start position:0%
money from the federal government
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
so once they became enrolled ordinarily
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
we'd see a churn there in fact I think
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
we have a slide somewhere in in the deck
 
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
as well it talks about typically how
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
long someone spends on granite Advantage
 
00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
it's not it's a program where we've had
 
00:33:57.299 --> 00:33:59.269 align:start position:0%
it's not it's a program where we've had
221

00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
221
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
000 different individuals since I think
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
2014 who've been on the program
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
ordinarily we've been averaging about in
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
the fifty thousand 152
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
000 range and so this is extraordinarily
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
extraordinary growth and and uh I think
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
reflected the the the hit to the
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
temporary hit to the economy where a lot
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
of people became eligible who lost their
 
00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.690 align:start position:0%
of people became eligible who lost their
positions

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:25.570 align:start position:0%
positions
um

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:25.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
on page 17 you can see we've created
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
three maps by county in terms of the
 
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
growth by county and you can see in
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
terms of granted Advantage it wasn't
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
isolated to one County it was all over
 
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
the map so to speak
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
um and you can look at the other
 
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
programs where there's a lesser amount
 
00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:45.419 align:start position:0%
of growth
 
00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:50.149 align:start position:0%
 
Paige

00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
Paige
 
00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:50.990 align:start position:0%
Paige
um

00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:54.419 align:start position:0%
18 sort of another look at it by looking
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
at it by the end of February
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
jumping onto page 19
 
00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:01.490 align:start position:0%
jumping onto page 19
um

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.010 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:03.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
this is where I was talking about where
 
00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:08.780 align:start position:0%
we expect the disenrollment to come from
 
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
people who have
 
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
maintained continuous eligibility
 
00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:15.410 align:start position:0%
maintained continuous eligibility
um

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
and they're sort of broken into two
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
groups the smaller group that almost 29
 
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
000 are people who have completed their
 
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.290 align:start position:0%
000 are people who have completed their
redetermination

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
redetermination
 
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
um but say largely or over income but
 
00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
are protected
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
um and then there's the group that's
 
00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
nearly 73 000 that are people who have
 
00:35:34.619 --> 00:35:35.870 align:start position:0%
nearly 73 000 that are people who have
not

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
um completed it on a voluntary basis and
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
that number would be over a hundred
 
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
thousand if we weren't for the work we
 
00:35:41.569 --> 00:35:41.579 align:start position:0%
had done
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
um earlier so the total protected
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
population is about a hundred and almost
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
a hundred and two thousand and these
 
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
numbers reflect
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
um we've updated them for the new
 
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
federal poverty limits that went into
 
00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
effect uh or go into effect uh I think
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
in March one so this gives you a
 
00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
snapshot there were about 1700
 
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
individuals that benefited from the from
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
the higher poverty uh levels
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
um so so I think you're hinting around
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
it but what explain exactly what you
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
mean by protected protected by what and
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
what are the implications of that so
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the protected means
 
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:20.220 align:start position:0%
that if it weren't for the continuous
 
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
enrollment Provisions that were
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
originally under the federal Public
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
Health emergency and then extended with
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
an end date through the Consolidated
 
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
appropriation act that was passed in
 
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
December that created a definitive end
 
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
date which was March 31st of continuous
 
00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:38.339 align:start position:0%
enrollment were not for this under
 
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
normal business operations that most of
 
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
these people would likely not continue
 
00:36:46.849 --> 00:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
to be eligible some in the 73 000 may
 
00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
have information that says that they are
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
eligible and that's if you kind of look
 
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
at this number from a large standpoint
 
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
it's about 60 percent of this page that
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
we think will no longer be on Medicaid
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
we think a large percentage of the
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
pending and eligible may be able to be
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for exchange coverage or may
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
have had a change in circumstance that
 
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
allows them to get employer-based
 
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
insurance so this gets us back to that
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
same 59 000 number that you cited
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
exactly earlier we take a percentage of
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
the 101 000 that we think will remain in
 
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
the program
 
00:37:20.569 --> 00:37:20.579 align:start position:0%
slide coming up that goes in that little
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
more detail
 
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.390 align:start position:0%
more detail
um

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
page 20 is the sort of just the
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
definitions that I just talked about 21
 
00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
gives you a picture of the ineligible
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
excuse me the protected population you
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
can see that the granite Advantage
 
00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
population is the largest one and you'd
 
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:43.140 align:start position:0%
expect that there to be a good amount of
 
00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
turnover in this group because it's
 
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:47.579 align:start position:0%
typically a program people don't stay on
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
for the long term the one that concerns
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
me as the Medicaid director and should
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
concern us all is that the children and
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
making sure that none of them lose
 
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.250 align:start position:0%
making sure that none of them lose
coverage

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:57.260 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily there is part of the
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
Consolidated appropriation Act is
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
providing children one year of
 
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage starting January 1
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
of 24. and I'll talk a little bit about
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
how we've factored that in but we've
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
done a lot of Outreach on the far right
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
to the and we've done that with the mcos
 
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
we've done that with providers and other
 
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to to work the right hand
 
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
side of the chart and the other groups
 
00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:26.339 align:start position:0%
to a lower level and we still hope to
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
make further progress on on that in the
 
00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:32.839 align:start position:0%
coming weeks and months
 
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:37.820 align:start position:0%
if you go to slide 22
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
the first slide we look at the 102 000
 
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
roughly was looking at an individual
 
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
basis but that's actually not how we
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
typically do eligibility we do it on a
 
00:38:50.569 --> 00:38:50.579 align:start position:0%
household basis and and think about that
 
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
as if you had a household of four people
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
why come back over and over again to do
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
the eligibility we do it on a household
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
basis and so these are just household
 
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.430 align:start position:0%
basis and so these are just household
numbers

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
um moving to slide 23
 
00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.650 align:start position:0%
um moving to slide 23
um

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
what we have here is each state in order
 
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
to begin the unwind had to present to
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
CMS a plan of how they could you hold
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
for a question here in order
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
um could you talk a little bit about the
 
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
overdue redetermination is that an
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
employment issue in your department or
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
what would be the definition of that so
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
under the federal Public Health
 
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
Emergency and then under the
 
00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:35.660 align:start position:0%
Consolidated appropriation act
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
individuals did not it was voluntary to
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
complete every determination
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
um some some states didn't even do
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
voluntary predeterminations we continued
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
to do where people were interested in
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
protecting themselves and doing them in
 
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
advance what we try to get a message out
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
is you don't want to wait till
 
00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:55.619 align:start position:0%
everybody's doing at the same time we
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
want to kind of spread the workload out
 
00:39:59.450 --> 00:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
a bit and so these are individuals for
 
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
whatever reason haven't taken advantage
 
00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
of the voluntary situation it may very
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
well be that some won't apply but
 
00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
they're just they just haven't had to do
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
it and we can't force them to do it we
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
as of March 31st that option of not
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't because of your situation
 
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
in the department it was because the
 
00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
people were applying and they weren't
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
following up they didn't they weren't
 
00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
required from an eligibility standpoint
 
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:39.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:39.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
so the Distribution on page 22 the sort
 
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
of the middle chart there is the number
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
of redeterminations we plan to be doing
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
what we call full redeterminations
 
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
um on a monthly basis including those
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
that are in the the 102 000 plus all the
 
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
the ones that uh or the 73 000 that all
 
00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
those that we um plan to do plus our
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
regular work of people who came on later
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
who are there redeterminate
 
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
determination dates coming up one of the
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
things that is a condition that's
 
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
reflected in this chart is we can't do
 
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
everybody at once we have to we have to
 
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
spread the workload out so that we can
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
don't end up having this big issue over
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
and over again so that's what's
 
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative very quick question how
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
are you guys determining
 
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
um who you deal with first is there any
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
logic to that or is it random it there
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
is definitely logic to it um great yeah
 
00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.630 align:start position:0%
is definitely logic to it um great yeah
the

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
if you turn to the next uh slide 24 out
 
00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.210 align:start position:0%
if you turn to the next uh slide 24 out
um

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
on the far right
 
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
um towards the on the top chart you'll
 
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
see the numbers that I've been talking
 
00:41:59.329 --> 00:41:59.339 align:start position:0%
about the 72 802 the 101
 
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
um thousand and the 28 000 996 that
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's what you saw earlier on that
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
three block chart
 
00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
um what you see on the left hand side
 
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
are the groupings of different
 
00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
eligibility groups what we tried to do
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
is we ran data to look at people who
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
have been on the program who have not
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
used services and actually it's it's a
 
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
fairly large percentage particularly in
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
the in the in some groups and so that
 
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
the people who have you know had we've
 
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
been paying a premium but uh aren't
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
using the services that's who we're
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
rolling off first those who we think are
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
likely to be eligible someone in a
 
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
nursing home someone who's in CFI
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
someone who has a mental illness someone
 
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
who has a severe medical condition we've
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
tried to move them further out
 
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
um in the in the unwind and so that 73
 
00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
000 individuals you can see that some
 
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
have a new redetermination date that
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
would take them as far out as
 
00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
um you know the end of the year but most
 
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:07.140 align:start position:0%
of it's done by September
 
00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:07.730 align:start position:0%
of it's done by September
um

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
and what we've tried to do is
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
work with our mcos and providers to
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
identify those individuals where we've
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
seen High utilization where we're
 
00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
concerned that they have an underlying
 
00:43:20.569 --> 00:43:20.579 align:start position:0%
medical condition that might be
 
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
affecting their ability to that we're
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
doing extra Outreach in fact we've
 
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
called everybody on this list multiple
 
00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:29.339 align:start position:0%
times on an outbound basis and we've
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
given lists to our MCO and and some key
 
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
stakeholder providers like Mental Health
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
Centers area agencies federally
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Centers of lists of
 
00:43:43.609 --> 00:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
their patients what was missing from
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
them to complete their redetermination
 
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
so that we can get them to also
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
participate in helping get the message
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
out to individuals
 
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:56.339 align:start position:0%
and the the numbers in red there are
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
what we estimate to close now this is
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
basically developed based on experience
 
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
of closure and more normal circumstances
 
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
will be tracking this stuff see how this
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
actually plays out
 
00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.470 align:start position:0%
actually plays out
um

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
then the second chart uh there is the
 
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
the pending and eligible group today I
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's nearly 29 000
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
individuals that are within their
 
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
12-month of redetermination they've done
 
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
it already but there's a a group of
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
about 7 300 by the time we get to
 
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
actually being able to do this that will
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
require us to go through another full
 
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
redetermination with them but the rest
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
of them will have an opportunity to let
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
us know if there's a change in
 
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
circumstances but we don't have to go
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
through a full redetermination on the
 
00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
almost 22 000 people the 21 687
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
um and then what you'll see is if you
 
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
look at this chart that we expect the
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
earlier months to have a higher closure
 
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
rate than the lower months in the later
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
months because again we picked to unwind
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
people who generally haven't been using
 
00:45:02.809 --> 00:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
Services more um as being the
 
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
individuals to work with first
 
00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:08.579 align:start position:0%
let me stop there that's a that's a lot
 
00:45:08.579 --> 00:45:11.030 align:start position:0%
let me stop there that's a that's a lot
um

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
thank you where in the budget would we
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
see the expected savings from this
 
00:45:23.569 --> 00:45:23.579 align:start position:0%
roll-off process so in 7948 and 79 51 is
 
00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
where the budget reflects the unwind
 
00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.170 align:start position:0%
where the budget reflects the unwind
um

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:29.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
so Mr White would you tell us the page
 
00:45:35.569 --> 00:45:35.579 align:start position:0%
number that uh Mr Lemon is referring to
 
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:38.579 align:start position:0%
sure so in in the governor's recommended
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
budget if if you turn to page uh 922
 
00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
um that that's the account for standard
 
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.270 align:start position:0%
um that that's the account for standard
Medicaid

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
um that that would be impacted and then
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:56.579 align:start position:0%
um hmm
 
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
and then uh page 923 as well
 
00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:08.900 align:start position:0%
um can we stay on 9 22 a second sure
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
crosswalk us what line you would have us
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.839 --> 00:46:20.150 align:start position:0%
 
place

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
the the the impact would be to
 
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:25.809 align:start position:0%
the the the impact would be to
um

00:46:25.809 --> 00:46:25.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
so that if there are more individuals
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
enrolled in Medicaid the per member per
 
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
month cost would increase and and it
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
would be an impact there so so this is
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
the problem with us looking at different
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
documents I I I'm not sure I know what
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
line item you're on I'm on page 922 yep
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
in the in the uh first words there are
 
00:46:56.329 --> 00:46:56.339 align:start position:0%
Health and Social Services zero five yep
 
00:46:58.450 --> 00:46:58.460 align:start position:0%
so if if you move down then you'll see
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
79.48 that's the Medicaid Care
 
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
Management account 79
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
48. and then slide
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
oh I see and I see in oh seven seven
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
nine four eight Medicaid Care Management
 
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
okay yeah now what and then if if you
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
slide down to 101 medical payments to
 
00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
Providers yes sir I'm there yep and and
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
I think what's important to to point out
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
is we did submit a prioritized needs
 
00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.890 align:start position:0%
is we did submit a prioritized needs
request

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
um to cover the The increased cost
 
00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:37.550 align:start position:0%
um to cover the The increased cost
resulting

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
resulting
 
00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
um from The Continuous enrollment
 
00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
um and and I believe the LBA had
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
provided the committee with the
 
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
preliminary hb2 general fund
 
00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:48.650 align:start position:0%
preliminary hb2 general fund
Appropriations

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
um and right and we the included in the
 
00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.849 align:start position:0%
um and right and we the included in the
governor's

00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
um what I anticipate to be included in
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
the governor is hb2 is 16.3 million
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
dollars of General funds to cover those
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
those increased enrollment figures
 
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
16.3 and FY 24. uh yeah it will be
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
appropriated for the biennium is my
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
understanding and it's coming out of the
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 23 Surplus is the way
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
that it's currently proposed okay but
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
the 16.3 is for both fiscal both years
 
00:48:23.569 --> 00:48:23.579 align:start position:0%
of the of the biennium I I haven't seen
 
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
the final hb2 language
 
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
um I I would assume it would either be
 
00:48:29.329 --> 00:48:29.339 align:start position:0%
for the biennial or state fiscal year 24
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
though and that's supposed to be Surplus
 
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
you have another question there
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you so if this is
 
00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
what we would see the reduction
 
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
it appears like we're seeing an increase
 
00:48:50.089 --> 00:48:50.099 align:start position:0%
or am I misreading that so I think if if
 
00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
you recall I think we've had offline
 
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
conversation about this in terms of the
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Program where we've
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
seen the 86 percent that was a that is
 
00:49:02.089 --> 00:49:02.099 align:start position:0%
not reflected in these numbers right
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
this is just a non-grant Advantage yeah
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
so you don't expect to see a savings in
 
00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:08.579 align:start position:0%
the non-grant advantage would you expect
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
to see some there but much much less
 
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
savings because people who generally
 
00:49:16.609 --> 00:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
qualify for the the other programs you
 
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
know they're
 
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
um you know categorically eligible at
 
00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
the age of the blind the disabled
 
00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
um you know there's some groups that
 
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
will developmental disabled I mean those
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
are once they tend to get eligibility
 
00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.930 align:start position:0%
are once they tend to get eligibility
there's

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
um you know so that'll make sense but
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
the numbers are going up not even
 
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
staying the same so we do we do have
 
00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
expect that
 
00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
um there is I think we've built in about
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
a three percent increase related to just
 
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
the cost of Medical Care
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and the prioritized need of
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
additional funding for other rate
 
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
increases are not reflected in these
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
numbers okay I know you can't show us
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
where the grant Advantage Program is in
 
00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
the budget because it's not in the
 
00:49:56.809 --> 00:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
budget but could you get us the
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
information that corresponds to that
 
00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
program I think there's actually
 
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
um in your binder there's the
 
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
I can get I can get to easier just send
 
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:08.099 align:start position:0%
it to you but we do I think within some
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
of the information we provided
 
00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
um there's reports on we're just refer
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
me to it'd be great thank you actually I
 
00:50:14.569 --> 00:50:14.579 align:start position:0%
actually might have something here that
 
00:50:16.849 --> 00:50:16.859 align:start position:0%
I can hand to you on the way out for
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
that thank you so so I'm slower than
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
most so 3.1 percent across the board
 
00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate that the governor is
 
00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:29.579 align:start position:0%
requesting is not reflected or is
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
reflected in this 750 million dollar
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
line item on 24. it is not it is not but
 
00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.329 align:start position:0%
line item on 24. it is not it is not but
a

00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
factor for medical costs of three
 
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
percent is included okay so if if we
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
were to take the proposal we would
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
multiply this by another uh 3.1 percent
 
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
to get the real request yes
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
for this particular and so so all the
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
people looking at the budget have to
 
00:51:03.049 --> 00:51:03.059 align:start position:0%
keep in their mind that this is not the
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
number we're appropriating where if we
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
go with the 3.1 percent in hb2 we're
 
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
appropriating 3.1 percent more than this
 
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
and then you're asking for another 16.3
 
00:51:17.569 --> 00:51:17.579 align:start position:0%
on top of it is that 16.3 to help with
 
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
the 3.1 percent or is it to help with
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
the inflation rate what what's again
 
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
what's the justification for doing that
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
sure so I I one thing that we haven't
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:51:29.569 --> 00:51:29.579 align:start position:0%
um one of the Key conditions of the
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
continuous enrollment was that we were
 
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
unallowed to disenroll individuals but
 
00:51:34.849 --> 00:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
one of the key advantages of not doing
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
that was we were allowed an additional
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
6.2 percent uh match or fmap from from
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
the federal government and that's
 
00:51:45.049 --> 00:51:45.059 align:start position:0%
phasing down so beginning
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
um the last quarter of the state fiscal
 
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
year we'll have the five percent then
 
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
we'll have the two and a half percent
 
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
for the first quarter of next year then
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
the one and a half percent and that's
 
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
based on the assumption that we will
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
disenroll those individuals through that
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
process however
 
00:52:02.569 --> 00:52:02.579 align:start position:0%
um based on the plan uh that that the
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
team has been working on for a very long
 
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
time that that Henry just spoke to uh
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
relative to the disenrollment process we
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
will still have a higher than initially
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
anticipated uh or higher enrollment
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
figures and so that 6.3 is intended to
 
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
cover the costs of of the higher number
 
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
of enrollees in the program now the
 
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
the three percent the three percent rate
 
00:52:32.569 --> 00:52:32.579 align:start position:0%
increase that that's that will be a what
 
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
I anticipate to be a separate hb2
 
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
provision when hb2 is released so those
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
are those are distinct and separate so
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
the enhanced fmap the five percent the
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
2.4 and then whatever
 
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
are those enhancements showing up in a
 
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:52.140 align:start position:0%
revenue line somewhere or those off
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
budget offset of expense I believe is
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
so we've we've we've built those figures
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
into the assumptions and and so that
 
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
that 16.3 million dollar uh general fund
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
hb2 appropriation in our original agency
 
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
request that was close to 25 or 26 back
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
in the fall but we've we've had we have
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
new updated figures and so we revised
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
that during the governor's phase
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
um we'll continue to look at that to see
 
00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099 align:start position:0%
if there is opportunity to revise that
 
00:53:26.099 --> 00:53:27.349 align:start position:0%
if there is opportunity to revise that
further

00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
um but but that that is based on the
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
projections that we have the five
 
00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:32.579 align:start position:0%
percent phase down
 
00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
um and the budget is built built on on
 
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
the information that we have there
 
00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:39.140 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative erf and then
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative I just put that in
 
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
different words the fact that the F map
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
is going away we're getting less money
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
from that the six months the 16.3 is
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
intended to backfill those reductions
 
00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
as if you kind of think of this the
 
00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
unwind is going to be like a slope it's
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
to help cover the slope down to where we
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
get back to a more normal the slope
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
being though you're not getting as much
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
money through the F map well the slope
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
being that not everybody the 58 000 as
 
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
an example aren't leaving April 1st
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%
they're going to be leaving over the
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
course of now and until uh December of
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
uh I get that but is the is the 16.3
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
million meant to
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
substitute for the fact that you're
 
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
getting Less in the fmap or is it for
 
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
something else no I think the the net
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
effect is if the 6.2 historically has
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
been covering the increase in enrollment
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
as that's going down we need to fill
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
that hole a bit yes which is what those
 
00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
funds are intended to do yes okay thank
 
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:38.569 align:start position:0%
funds are intended to do yes okay thank
you

00:54:38.569 --> 00:54:38.579 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
so this is in a similar vein so you know
 
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
we're looking uh federal funds were just
 
00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:49.859 align:start position:0%
under 500 million in 2022 with an
 
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
additional 182 million of other funds
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
and uh they've dropped down to just over
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
400 million so
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:03.059 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial uh but yet despite
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
that the general fund um uh is only only
 
00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:11.180 align:start position:0%
funding about 210 10 million uh for the
 
00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
7948 account
 
00:55:16.849 --> 00:55:16.859 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:55:16.859 --> 00:55:18.170 align:start position:0%
um uh
so

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.549 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out where
 
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know where the rest of the backfill
 
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
is coming from
 
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'm following your question
 
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
I apologize so from 2022 to 20 I'm
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
comparing 2022 actual to 2024 Governors
 
00:55:39.359 --> 00:55:40.970 align:start position:0%
comparing 2022 actual to 2024 Governors
recommended

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
I'm under
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
um 009 agency income which has three
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
subdivided categories uh federal funds
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
General funds and other funds
 
00:55:51.119 --> 00:55:52.549 align:start position:0%
General funds and other funds
so

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:54.170 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
so you're with me so far yes so one
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
thing that that I I do want to point out
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
so if if you do look at the federal
 
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
funds line for 22 you have the the 400
 
00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
481 million basically you have the 396
 
00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:15.059 align:start position:0%
in-state fiscal year 23. now that
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
doesn't include the most recent accept
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
and expend item that we brought forward
 
00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh that was just approved by GNC uh last
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
week and that was for 52. 51 million
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
so the other thing to keep in mind is
 
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.690 align:start position:0%
so the other thing to keep in mind is
that

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
the both the agency budget and the
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
governor's budget were probably largely
 
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
prepared before but the knowing the end
 
00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
of the federal Public Health Emergency
 
00:56:41.089 --> 00:56:41.099 align:start position:0%
and then the continuous enrollment under
 
00:56:44.089 --> 00:56:44.099 align:start position:0%
the Consolidated appropriation Act
 
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
 
00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:48.170 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
um

00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
uh I think I'll pass on the rest for now
 
00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
um back to the slide decks 25 is just
 
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
we're gonna is a a dashboard that we're
 
00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
going to have to be able to track
 
00:57:08.569 --> 00:57:08.579 align:start position:0%
um what's going on and
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
um not going to go in detail here other
 
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
than subsequently when you have
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
questions and when we come to fiscal
 
00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:16.140 align:start position:0%
committee and what have you uh we'll be
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
able to drill down and provide different
 
00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:20.540 align:start position:0%
cuts on the data
 
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
and then slide uh 26 is
 
00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
um the it's a table that shows the
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
federal matching percentage by state
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and quarters running through
 
00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
25. if you go to the far right you can
 
00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:40.460 align:start position:0%
see that in 25 it's back to fully
 
00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
current law which is 50 for the standard
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
program 65 for breast and cervical
 
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
cancer 65 for the chip program and 90
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
for Family Planning and granted
 
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
Advantage but that's just a we talk
 
00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
about about Federal matching percentage
 
00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
that's what we're referring to
 
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
can I actually ask a quick question on
 
00:58:02.329 --> 00:58:02.339 align:start position:0%
that because I've been trying to get an
 
00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
answer to this you include Family
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
Planning here at 90 Federal so I've I've
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
asked for that response for that match
 
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
I've never been given a solid answer
 
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
like that they tell me it's kind of
 
00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
variable it depends on what we apply for
 
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
what's the actual is it is it a straight
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
90 10 or is it something else
 
00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.130 align:start position:0%
90 10 or is it something else
um

00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
there may be some permutations but I
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
think the core program is 90 the the the
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
question that that I um that I believe
 
00:58:28.609 --> 00:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
we had gone back and forth on and have
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
had discussions
 
00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:32.819 align:start position:0%
um with Trisha Tilley the division of
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services director is that
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
the the maintenance of effort question
 
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
the match question if you look at the
 
00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:42.059 align:start position:0%
regulations that that we have from the
 
00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
federal government which I believe we
 
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
provided it doesn't specify and I know
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
she's been working on getting Clarity
 
00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:49.140 align:start position:0%
around what that represents and I know
 
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
she'll be ready to talk to that tomorrow
 
00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:54.299 align:start position:0%
course and some of that funding may not
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
be Medicaid funding this is the Medicaid
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
component only
 
00:58:58.920 --> 00:58:59.770 align:start position:0%
component only
um

00:58:59.770 --> 00:58:59.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
the next section
 
00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
um gets into uh let's let's take a pause
 
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
there for the folks new to division
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
three do you know what the distinction
 
00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:11.569 align:start position:0%
three do you know what the distinction
are

00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:11.579 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
between maintenance of effort and the
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
general funds match do you know what
 
00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
those are
 
00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.710 align:start position:0%
those are
[Music]

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
one do it do a really quick description
 
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
of what those two things are and how
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
they're how they're different from each
 
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:29.220 align:start position:0%
other sure so
 
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
um simplistically and and I I think the
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program is is a great example
 
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
of this if you look at the standard
 
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
Medicaid line on page 26 it's a 50 match
 
00:59:41.809 --> 00:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
so we have to spend fifty dollars in
 
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
order to get fifty dollars from the
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
um TANF which which we talked about I
 
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
believe the week before that that's
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's more of a maintenance of effort
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
requirement where we need to spend a
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
threshold dollar amount so roughly 32
 
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
million dollars in order to receive the
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
federal 38 million dollars and if we
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
don't meet the maintenance of effort
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
then the subsequent year we get a
 
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
reduced amount of funding plus we Face a
 
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
penalty so there's almost a spiraling
 
01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.789 align:start position:0%
penalty so there's almost a spiraling
effect

01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
um to doing that so so again match
 
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
literally it's it's a match 50 50 or 65
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
35 whatever it might be versus
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort where you have to
 
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
meet a certain level of spending in
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
order to receive a dollar amount that
 
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
and it may be that's just spending the
 
01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
match gives you the mace the the uh the
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
minimum threshold but it may also be
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
that it does not or is it a separate
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
amount of money that has to be spent
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
from the match
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
the general fund match
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
so if we're talking Medicaid it's we
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
have to spend the money to get the money
 
01:00:52.609 --> 01:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
so that for first
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
on the set of benefits that falls under
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
Family Planning
 
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
we pay a
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
we pay a premium or pay or pay a FIFA
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
service amount and then we then make the
 
01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:05.339 align:start position:0%
federal claim so that's that's how that
 
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
one works
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
but is it possible the federal claim
 
01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
equals the
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
what would be the general fund match
 
01:01:17.809 --> 01:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
or is the general fund match on top of
 
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
the general fund expenditure happens
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
first and then we get reimbursed for
 
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%
what is the federal responsibility so if
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
we pay out a hundred dollars we'll get
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
back 90. oh okay but if you're if your
 
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
Moe is if maintenance of effort in the
 
01:01:35.809 --> 01:01:35.819 align:start position:0%
case of Medicaid means not reducing
 
01:01:35.819 --> 01:01:37.490 align:start position:0%
case of Medicaid means not reducing
eligibility

01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
um criteria or making it harder to get
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
eligible during the
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
um the continuous enrollment period so
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
that's okay so Moe is a positive
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is not a dollar figure no it's
 
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
not a dollar figure but what you were
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
talking about in other instances it is a
 
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
dollar figure
 
01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:54.770 align:start position:0%
dollar figure
correct

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
if if we're talking about
 
01:01:59.329 --> 01:01:59.339 align:start position:0%
um like like specific Federal grant
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
awards that we're receiving I I mean
 
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
oftentimes like TANF you mentioned yeah
 
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
sure so so so tan if we have to spend a
 
01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:08.579 align:start position:0%
certain threshold in order to receive
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing other questions go ahead
 
01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
oh wait representative uh is there
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
um any ceiling on these uh individual
 
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
programs or it's just based on need and
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
actual expenditures
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
the latter would be the answer
 
01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:30.230 align:start position:0%
the latter would be the answer
representative

01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
to the maintenance of effort is sort of
 
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
its own ceiling is the way I understand
 
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
it you have to cross that and you don't
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
have to spend above that but you have to
 
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
cross that and then the match is is
 
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid Medicaid maintenance
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
effort typically refers to the
 
01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
eligibility levels not the amount of
 
01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:57.059 align:start position:0%
spending because there isn't as
 
01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham noted is in his
 
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
question there isn't a limit on who can
 
01:03:05.089 --> 01:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
participate if you're eligible you're
 
01:03:05.099 --> 01:03:06.230 align:start position:0%
participate if you're eligible you're
eligible

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
um and so with respect to Medicaid it
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
refers to maintaining the eligibility
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
levels and and and sometimes also can
 
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you Mr chair so is it
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
possible to understand
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
which funds are tied to Dollar spend
 
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
versus percentages of Eligibility if I
 
01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
heard you correctly right some funds are
 
01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
about who's enrolled in the program to
 
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
meet that minimum threshold and other
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
fun other funds or programs are tied to
 
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
Dollars spent so so the budget briefing
 
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
books that that we've been providing and
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
will continue to will provide the public
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
health tomorrow
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
um we've tried to set those up to
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
address that very question and address
 
01:03:56.089 --> 01:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
the question of what funding sources are
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
in this account are there any specific
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
unique circumstances
 
01:04:03.289 --> 01:04:03.299 align:start position:0%
um the intent of those books is to try
 
01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
to hit that very question
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
um and and if there are specific
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
questions that you don't see answered in
 
01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
there please let me know and and we will
 
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
get you an answer
 
01:04:14.569 --> 01:04:14.579 align:start position:0%
I'll just ask again on the briefing book
 
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
where where is the Medicaid section what
 
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.289 align:start position:0%
where where is the Medicaid section what
page

01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
I've gone through this several times I
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
just I must be blind
 
01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.430 align:start position:0%
just I must be blind
so

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
um if if we're talking about standard
 
01:04:27.839 --> 01:04:29.270 align:start position:0%
um if if we're talking about standard
Medicaid

01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
on page 12 I see very big child care
 
01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.670 align:start position:0%
on page 12 I see very big child care
licensing

01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
01:05:01.849 --> 01:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't see and I see the first
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
Black Bullet Medicaid provider
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
enrollment unit are my pages different
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
so on on page 12 if if you scroll down
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
about Midway it's Medicaid management I
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
think I'm on a different budget book
 
01:05:13.079 --> 01:05:15.530 align:start position:0%
think I'm on a different budget book
somehow

01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chair go ahead thank you Mr chair
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate that we got these and
 
01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at it now if there's any way
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
to get them the day before the
 
01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
presentation so we can review them ahead
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
of time it's a whole lot easier than
 
01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
trying to review them right they came
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
this morning to review them concurrently
 
01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
why they're being covered
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
okay so uh
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
starting on page 27 is
 
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
um I think there was an interest when we
 
01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
were here uh last budget cycle in terms
 
01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
of our quality strategy and and various
 
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
activities related to
 
01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:19.670 align:start position:0%
activities related to
um

01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
Service delivery and we we come up with
 
01:06:24.529 --> 01:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
each year
 
01:06:24.539 --> 01:06:25.250 align:start position:0%
each year
um

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:27.980 align:start position:0%
10 or 11 goals
 
01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
to try to improve but uh just in terms
 
01:06:33.609 --> 01:06:33.619 align:start position:0%
of slide
 
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
28 is just a
 
01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
a reference to the consumer guide that
 
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
people who are choosing among the three
 
01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
plans can look at so Mr Lipman sure
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
slide 27 and 28 lots of interesting
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
information which lines in the
 
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
governor's budget are you justifying
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
I I I'm not seeing the connection
 
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
between sort of this General background
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
information and the decisions you're
 
01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:06.299 align:start position:0%
asking division three to make
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
in the end right the level of spending
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
um you're looking for we're looking for
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
certain outcomes to be improved through
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
that spending
 
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:17.780 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that there's a
 
01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:19.870 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that there's a
one-to-one

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
one-to-one
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
correlation but I think in terms of what
 
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
is the spending
 
01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
um delivering for us in terms of of
 
01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:29.780 align:start position:0%
quality and where do we need to improve
 
01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:33.299 align:start position:0%
based on you know our program is how I
 
01:07:36.049 --> 01:07:36.059 align:start position:0%
would connect this section
 
01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
um to the budget
 
01:07:37.619 --> 01:07:39.230 align:start position:0%
um to the budget
um

01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
and so I think that that's
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
um I can
 
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
either continue here or go back come
 
01:07:48.049 --> 01:07:48.059 align:start position:0%
back to it if we have more time if
 
01:07:49.809 --> 01:07:49.819 align:start position:0%
that's your preference
 
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
you know as I mentioned at the outset
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm really kind of interested in the
 
01:07:57.049 --> 01:07:57.059 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet where we look at the various
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
rates and what your recommendations are
 
01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:02.700 align:start position:0%
and this sauce is feeling like lots of
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
good General background but I don't know
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
how to connect the general background to
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
your budget request I don't know which
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
budget requests are reasonable and which
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
are not I cannot tie these two documents
 
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
that may be my limitation but that's
 
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.809 --> 01:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
I think the way I would connect it is
 
01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
you know the two big line items of
 
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
expenditures are in 79 48 and 7 70 51
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
which are the the general standard
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program and also uh the
 
01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:42.020 align:start position:0%
children's health insurance program
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
obviously not in here because it's not
 
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
on budget is also the granted Advantage
 
01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
program and we're required
 
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
um and also committed to trying to
 
01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:54.410 align:start position:0%
um and also committed to trying to
um

01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
deliver on certain metrics related to
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
the program and how for example in this
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
report is a discussion of our eqro which
 
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
is uh if you kind of think about it in
 
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
the construction business right
 
01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have a clerk of the works
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
the the clerk of the works in the case
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
of the Medicaid Managed Care Program as
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
the eqro they come in and evaluate
 
01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
whether the CMS makes the state pay for
 
01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
this is to make sure that the contract
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
terms are being met that are in the
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
Managed Care contract so that would be
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
one example of connecting that
 
01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.550 align:start position:0%
one example of connecting that
expenditure

01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
um in in our contracts line to um to the
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
budget that you see
 
01:09:41.329 --> 01:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
um that would be one I think concrete
 
01:09:41.339 --> 01:09:42.410 align:start position:0%
um that would be one I think concrete
example

01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
um then there with respect to the
 
01:09:46.809 --> 01:09:46.819 align:start position:0%
waivers where we're getting extra
 
01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity to draw a federal match
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
where we otherwise wouldn't typically do
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
it we're required to do evaluation
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
reports have an outside evaluator that's
 
01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
part of what's in this section as well
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
so in terms of uh the ability to draw
 
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
extra money to for substance use
 
01:10:06.189 --> 01:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
disorder and to um for mental illness
 
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
and in other parts of the department uh
 
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
there are waivers where we're getting
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
additional ability to to fund our
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
program without using general funds
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
um so that's I guess how I would make
 
01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
the connection
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
um and then just purely in terms of the
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
the color chart our areas can I tell you
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
how I look at it sure
 
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
I look that we got a Governor's budget
 
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
request we have specific programs lined
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
up we have specific line elements of of
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
each area with dollar amounts
 
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
to the extent that the dollar amount is
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
Justified the Manpower requests are
 
01:10:48.169 --> 01:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
Justified it should be because that
 
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
there's some sort of a backup saying you
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
see this line item the reason this makes
 
01:10:54.649 --> 01:10:54.659 align:start position:0%
sense is because this is what we're
 
01:10:54.659 --> 01:10:56.570 align:start position:0%
sense is because this is what we're
doing

01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:10:59.209 --> 01:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
that that that's the connection between
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
the budget and the explanation that in
 
01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
my view would be really helpful I I like
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
all of this stuff we could have done
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
this though before the budget was
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
released this is all good background
 
01:11:15.169 --> 01:11:15.179 align:start position:0%
information as far as I can tell
 
01:11:15.179 --> 01:11:16.550 align:start position:0%
information as far as I can tell
so

01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
um did you have a question
 
01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
representative I did and you may get to
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
this um twice I've heard you mentioned
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
that the granite Advantage program is
 
01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
not part of the budget
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
um if I recall there is some portion of
 
01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
State spending involved in that I don't
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
remember the percentage off the top of
 
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
my head are you covering that later in
 
01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
this presentation of course okay thank
 
01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:37.490 align:start position:0%
this presentation of course okay thank
you

01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
um again that's why and when I at the
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
beginning of our presentation I said
 
01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
here's different sections we could cover
 
01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
or not cover I'm happy not to I know the
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
only reason I include this section is
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
last time we came through this committee
 
01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
two years ago different composition they
 
01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
asked for this information so we were
 
01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
trying to be anticipatory and I
 
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.649 align:start position:0%
so okay
foreign

01:12:08.649 --> 01:12:08.659 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about Granite
 
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.370 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about Granite
advantage

01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
if if you uh
 
01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
I think one page got out of ordering but
 
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:43.370 align:start position:0%
 
.

01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.689 --> 01:12:46.699 align:start position:0%
this shows you from
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
January 1 of 19 through the estimate
 
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
that was prepared
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
um through State fiscal year 25
 
01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:00.380 align:start position:0%
what the expenses the non-federal share
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative hoole is the the third
 
01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:06.620 align:start position:0%
lying down and how we
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
obtain the money to fund that 10 share
 
01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
is the second section of the document if
 
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding correctly that second
 
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
section should be in the budget
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere tied to line items
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I heard you say it's not in
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
the budget right the proportion that's
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
covered by the state needs to be in this
 
01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
document somewhere to look at
 
01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
um it's not by the Department's design
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
the way it is it's that's
 
01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
the way it's been accounted for it's the
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
law yeah but one of my goals and I would
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
you be okay with it being on budget I
 
01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:44.900 align:start position:0%
believe I asked
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
we're agnostic with respect to I mean
 
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
whatever the legislature how they wanted
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
it accounted for there's no reason that
 
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
that just like other you know other
 
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
agency things elsewhere these same
 
01:13:59.630 --> 01:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
funding sources could be used but within
 
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
the budget so that it just appeared
 
01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
there and would it be make sense to then
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
ask for a separate accounting unit for
 
01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
that so that they could be accounted for
 
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
it separately from the standard Medicaid
 
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
if it were to be included in the budget
 
01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
follow up to that question sure
 
01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
so what would we need to do to make that
 
01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:24.770 align:start position:0%
so what would we need to do to make that
happen

01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
okay I've had an epiphany over here the
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
vice chair has been educating me
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
she says that what I ought to have been
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
looking at is I should have been
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
correlating three different documents
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
well while we were looking at this one
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
we have the the governor's budget
 
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
proposal two on the handout there's two
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
slides in there that are particularly
 
01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
relevant Pages seven and eight yes seven
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
and eight map into the budget book and
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
then instead of looking at all the
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
colored slides I should have slipped
 
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
over to this other unmarked document
 
01:15:09.649 --> 01:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
that that happens to start with maternal
 
01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:13.140 align:start position:0%
opioid misuse and model and it starts on
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
page one like the other four of these do
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we wanted to do right
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
so so
 
01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
are you done
 
01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.530 align:start position:0%
are you done
[Laughter]

01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
we want to provide what information do
 
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
you want
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
I I really want to see the spreadsheet I
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
do I want to see the rates I want to see
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
what your recommendations are I want to
 
01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
know what the impact is on the budget
 
01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:41.890 align:start position:0%
know what the impact is on the budget
because

01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:41.900 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to end up doing pretty
 
01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
much what the governor's budget request
 
01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
is I believe you know I don't I'm not
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of debate there but the the
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
real issue before us the one that we
 
01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
have to really talk about and decide I
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
think is we what what do we want to do
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
with the 3.1 percent do we want to just
 
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
take what the governor's ask us or do we
 
01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
want to put in the effort to figure out
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
if we want to make any tweaks to it I I
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
think that's that's the biggest decision
 
01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
we've got to make and I feel like we
 
01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
ought to start getting to it okay
 
01:16:16.729 --> 01:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
so in terms of uh
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
a colored presentation if you go to the
 
01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
last two pages the one that we've been
 
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
going through
 
01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:25.310 align:start position:0%
going through
um

01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
what I
 
01:16:28.729 --> 01:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
you know the the exercise that you asked
 
01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
us to do is a very large exercise there
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
um we've started to work on it
 
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
um and but I think in terms of
 
01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:39.169 align:start position:0%
um and but I think in terms of
um

01:16:39.169 --> 01:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
we've given you on slide 49 a look at
 
01:16:47.410 --> 01:16:47.420 align:start position:0%
calendar 2019 which is sort of
 
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
pre-covered period right and then 22 is
 
01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
a more we're getting back to to normal
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
period in terms of expenditures in these
 
01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
major groupings
 
01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:01.010 align:start position:0%
major groupings
um

01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:02.689 align:start position:0%
um
we

01:17:02.689 --> 01:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of a starting point so we
 
01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
know kind of what the base is this
 
01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:07.910 align:start position:0%
know kind of what the base is this
excludes

01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
excludes
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
um Administration this is just the
 
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
services this is Services delivered in
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
the case of Pharmacy and DME it would
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
include some of the actual
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals and supplies the
 
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
governor's budget in his address he that
 
01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:21.770 align:start position:0%
governor's budget in his address he that
the

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:22.510 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent was intended to cover
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
services not
 
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
okay in terms of things that we pay for
 
01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
under Medicaid Medicaid services
 
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
provided by providers is what the the
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent was intended for so what's
 
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
on this page a little bit more than that
 
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
but so
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
we had
 
01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:44.149 align:start position:0%
we had
um

01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
and Senate Bill 86 we had done some
 
01:17:50.209 --> 01:17:50.219 align:start position:0%
analysis of that bill earlier which is
 
01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
the request for 145 million
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
um over the biennium and just to to sort
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
of give you what that would equate to if
 
01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
you applied it across the board would be
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
about 11
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
across the board for
 
01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
what's in the budget and then another
 
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
approximately four million dollars to
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
cover the granite Advantage component in
 
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
terms of of those State matching funds
 
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
um so this is sort of the the
 
01:18:23.169 --> 01:18:23.179 align:start position:0%
if you will the base in which rates
 
01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
might be applied to okay that's that's
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
what you have here
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
um I do have
 
01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
um outside of this which I can hand to
 
01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:33.350 align:start position:0%
um outside of this which I can hand to
you

01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.450 align:start position:0%
you
um

01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
I did a couple looks at it the the chair
 
01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
asked me to sort of look at the Peridot
 
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
principle in terms of looking at sort of
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
the 80 20 perspective and so we did a
 
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
couple of cuts of that with the time
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
that we had available one one cut was
 
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
looking at the Professional Service
 
01:18:54.850 --> 01:18:54.860 align:start position:0%
component which is the the
 
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
491 million of spending in
 
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
um in state fiscal year 22. so we're are
 
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
you on table one or table two when
 
01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:06.659 align:start position:0%
you're citing that number I'm citing um
 
01:19:10.209 --> 01:19:10.219 align:start position:0%
the last very last page which is
 
01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:15.659 align:start position:0%
50 550 table two fifty table two
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
and and I see a 472 is that the number
 
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I'm I'm looking at
 
01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
the fourth one down Professional
 
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
Services okay 491 41 788 total okay I
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
see that number now so so just from an
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
illustration standpoint I have a handout
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
that we was prepared over the weekend on
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
that in terms of trying to look at how
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
many codes gets you to about 80 percent
 
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
of the the spend and then
 
01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:45.890 align:start position:0%
of the the spend and then
um

01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
if I cover earlier in the presentation I
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
sort of talk about a philosophical
 
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
approach in terms of how to approach
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
rate setting which is
 
01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
um you know beginning with
 
01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:57.830 align:start position:0%
um you know beginning with
um

01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
looking at how our rates where we have
 
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
an available rate to compare to Medicare
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
I talked about in in this presentation
 
01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.510 align:start position:0%
I talked about in in this presentation
um

01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.310 align:start position:0%
um
typically

01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
typically
 
01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is a percentage of Medicare uh
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
as opposed to 100 of it Medicare is
 
01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
supposed to represent the cost of a
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
reasonably efficient provider to deliver
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
a service in Medicaid there aren't
 
01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
always a matching number because of
 
01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
services that we provide are not
 
01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
included in the Medicaid Program are
 
01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
structured differently
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and so I think the exercise on a
 
01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
targeted rate increase basis is about
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
looking at it and sort of coming coming
 
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
around an issue so you know looking at
 
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
just how does the rate compare to
 
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
Medicare is one component of it looking
 
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
at other factors is are also necessary
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
to decide what you need to do when
 
01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a targeted rate
 
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
increase you know is there an access
 
01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
issue in other words are we able to
 
01:20:58.610 --> 01:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
provide the services that people are
 
01:21:01.010 --> 01:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
authorized to get are we able to provide
 
01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:02.420 align:start position:0%
them timely
 
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
another set of issues is how do how does
 
01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
our rate compare to other states how
 
01:21:12.490 --> 01:21:12.500 align:start position:0%
does the providers financial status
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
as a group play into it how does
 
01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:17.990 align:start position:0%
as a group play into it how does
um

01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
how does the workforce issues in that
 
01:21:22.610 --> 01:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
sector work and what is their percentage
 
01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
like for example some providers are 80
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
or 90 percent Medicaid so getting paid a
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
percentage of your cost on 80 or 90 of
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
your business it is very different than
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
if you're five percent Medicaid in terms
 
01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
of how rates factor into targeting
 
01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.290 align:start position:0%
of how rates factor into targeting
something

01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
so that's that's I think the the
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
exercise with a targeted rate increase
 
01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
we need to to be going through
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and I outline that in in this this
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
deck there are some slides that deal
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
with that but the you say you outline
 
01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
that outline that that sort of concept
 
01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
page slides uh
 
01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
42 and 43 was what I just sort of
 
01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:08.209 align:start position:0%
42 and 43 was what I just sort of
summarized

01:22:08.209 --> 01:22:08.219 align:start position:0%
summarized
 
01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
is is you know how how rates
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
you know generally work Medicaid rates
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
as a percentage your Medicare rates are
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
intended to cover a fully reasonably
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
efficient Provider commercial rates
 
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
would sometimes also need to be used you
 
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
know they're typically two times that of
 
01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:27.229 align:start position:0%
know they're typically two times that of
Medicare

01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
Medicare
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
um Physician Services are usually one
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
and a half times
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
um doesn't always hold true in all
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
provider types if that's true we have 13
 
01:22:42.169 --> 01:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
000 codes that we pay for but as uh as
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
the chair noted it's there's a large
 
01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
percentage that occur in a relatively uh
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
small number of codes
 
01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
um but I I've included in the slide deck
 
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
starting at page
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
um 44 some examples of of this this is
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
not finished product work but to try to
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
be responsive to the the chairs so this
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
doc that's slide 44 this is still
 
01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
historical this is this is not what
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
you're proposing no this is just to give
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
you a feel looking at it well 544 is
 
01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:16.460 align:start position:0%
looking at our our FIFA service
 
01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
activity only what percent of Medicare
 
01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
do these service code categories uh fall
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
into you can see
 
01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
um you know from surgery codes being 47
 
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
percent of Medicare
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
um you know being the low the the one at
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom at 188 is sort of a it's a
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
very small area and it's kind of
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
connected to supplies as opposed to
 
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
something else but just trying to give
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
you a flavor of what type of approach
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
you would take to at least as a starting
 
01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
point so within Medicaid yep we we pay a
 
01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
very small percentage of fee for service
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
right that was the whole point of the
 
01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
MCO so the percentage of Medicare so if
 
01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:02.219 align:start position:0%
I I am talking about the Medicaid budget
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
at some point yes so this is we're still
 
01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:07.340 align:start position:0%
talking about Medica
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
our rate in which the MCO pays and our
 
01:24:14.209 --> 01:24:14.219 align:start position:0%
budget is built off is built off paying
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
these percentages
 
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
today okay and that's why I think you're
 
01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
hearing from the provided community at
 
01:24:25.729 --> 01:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
large they're having difficulty meeting
 
01:24:25.739 --> 01:24:26.870 align:start position:0%
large they're having difficulty meeting
that

01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
um and
um

01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
so so once the money gets to the MCO do
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
they set their own rates for what they
 
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
pay out or or or do they still maintain
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
some sort of uh connectivity to the
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
initiating fee for service calculations
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
they do
 
01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
generally a provider doesn't typically
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
contract below the Medicaid rates they
 
01:24:57.169 --> 01:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
typically contract for a little bit
 
01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
above them because they expect that the
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
MCS that's a similar question or may or
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
or if it is I don't recognize my
 
01:25:06.649 --> 01:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
question and your answer so I guess as
 
01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
directly as possible the the fee
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
schedule that we publish is close to
 
01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:15.719 align:start position:0%
what the managed care companies pay in
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
almost all instances on a fee for
 
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
service basis but by the time we give
 
01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
them the money and they go into a
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
Managed Care Organization format they
 
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
are no longer paying fee for service are
 
01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:27.830 align:start position:0%
are no longer paying fee for service are
they

01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
their reimbursement typically follows
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
our fee schedule so an example of a
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
hospital okay so even though it's an MCO
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's an MCO to us but it's still largely
 
01:25:41.689 --> 01:25:41.699 align:start position:0%
uh the nature of a fee for service
 
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
within their MCO within their own
 
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
internal operations is that what I'm
 
01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
hearing you say
 
01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
in large measure yes okay
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:25:56.570 --> 01:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question can we go back just
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
to something you said a few minutes ago
 
01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
on page 43 comparing Regional State
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
rates can you discuss what the rates are
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
around us and how that could potentially
 
01:26:10.810 --> 01:26:10.820 align:start position:0%
impact Workforce shortage particularly
 
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
communities that are near
 
01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:13.850 align:start position:0%
communities that are near
um

01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
other states thanks
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
it I guess what I'm getting at there is
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's very specific to very specific
 
01:26:23.629 --> 01:26:23.639 align:start position:0%
Services I have in here an example of
 
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
that where
 
01:26:28.189 --> 01:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
where I can show you how we might look
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
at it and in sort of two instances I
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
included in here an example with our
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
ambulance services and I include an
 
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
example with home Home Health Care
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
private duty nursing and LPN Services
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
where I where I showed that kind of
 
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
analysis it's it's a this is a very big
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
project that's gonna to do targeted
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
radius increases going to not be
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
something we do in weeks it's going to
 
01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
take us months to be able to work
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
through it
 
01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:54.530 align:start position:0%
through it
um

01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
but in terms of of giving you a general
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
sense of what the dollar figure needs to
 
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
be in in the budget I think it's sort of
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
a sort of push-pull here is that I think
 
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear from the provider
 
01:27:09.169 --> 01:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
community that three percent is far
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
below what they see that they need
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
um in
 
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
um in a in a budget request I think in
 
01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:17.689 align:start position:0%
um in a in a budget request I think in
part

01:27:17.689 --> 01:27:17.699 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:18.290 align:start position:0%
part
um

01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
this is where I think it the art of this
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
whole rate setting process comes is that
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
you know in certain certain situations
 
01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
even if we're paying what other states
 
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
are paying or close to it you may hear
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
that it's not sufficient for
 
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
doing business in New Hampshire because
 
01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
of whatever issues that they have and
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
um even Benchmark to Medicare may not be
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
all that they feel that they need in
 
01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
order to to survive and keep up with
 
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
what's going on inflationary wise we in
 
01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
developing our recommendation I think
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
the what the governor included was you
 
01:27:59.689 --> 01:27:59.699 align:start position:0%
know goes back to August July time frame
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
when the market was you know bubbling up
 
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
that rate increases were needed but I
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
think in the past number of months it's
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
really with inflation having taken off
 
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
this fall in particular that we're
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
seeing much larger asks than what we
 
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
included in the budget
 
01:28:21.550 --> 01:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
so just to try to just
 
01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
I'm just taking a practice at using your
 
01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:28.580 align:start position:0%
slide 44. yes okay so a practice
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
oversimplification of the analysis would
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
be oh look we're paying 47 on surgery
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
codes that's probably too little given
 
01:28:41.570 --> 01:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
that under the coronavirus testing codes
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're paying 75 so there's probably some
 
01:28:46.850 --> 01:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
cost crisis that we're creating in those
 
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
different percentage reimbursements
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
that that's my simple view of this data
 
01:28:59.930 --> 01:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
yes and I think that part of the
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
situation with our codes is prior to the
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
21 and 20 20 and 21 rate increase in
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
some instances we hadn't touched our
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
fees in a decade or more some two
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
decades so some of these is just fallen
 
01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
out over time the Long Haul okay
 
01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
so so now the the problem
 
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
I would have with trying to take that
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
simple analysis and say okay 47 is too
 
01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
low 75 is too high I don't know what the
 
01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
relative impact of a change in those
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
areas are because I don't know what the
 
01:29:35.090 --> 01:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
total spend is so like if the surgery
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
code spend is 40x
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
coronavirus testing code is then it
 
01:29:47.450 --> 01:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter that I change one
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
for the other because there's not enough
 
01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
money there to rescue surgery codes so I
 
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
have an example that I'm prepared to
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
hand out that give you that level of
 
01:29:59.390 --> 01:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
detail on the Professional Services it
 
01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
has the has the code description this is
 
01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
what you ask for me yeah it has a code
 
01:30:08.330 --> 01:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
description it has the the spend on that
 
01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:09.530 align:start position:0%
description it has the the spend on that
code

01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
code
 
01:30:11.209 --> 01:30:11.219 align:start position:0%
um and the dollar amount of our current
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
fee schedule so oh fantastic so we can
 
01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
do that for the entire thing but it's
 
01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
it's just something I couldn't
 
01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
accomplish in a week's No no no I and
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
and I have to give you credit publicly
 
01:30:23.689 --> 01:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
you know because I don't think people
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
know what I asked you to do uh once the
 
01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
governor said that he thought we could
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
look at targeted uh Medicaid uh help uh
 
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
I I went to Mr Lipman and others and
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
said well what have you done so far to
 
01:30:41.209 --> 01:30:41.219 align:start position:0%
look at targeted uh changes and they had
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
not yet started the analysis and I said
 
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
oh geez well if we're going to even look
 
01:30:48.770 --> 01:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
at this could you could you could you do
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
an urgent crash project using sort of an
 
01:30:55.250 --> 01:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
80 20 rule the 80 20 rule for those who
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
aren't familiar with it is if you just
 
01:31:00.410 --> 01:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
if you just look at the data or the work
 
01:31:02.689 --> 01:31:02.699 align:start position:0%
that would get 80 percent of the job
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
done typically that only takes like 20
 
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
percent of the time it's not accurate
 
01:31:09.649 --> 01:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
but it gets you into the ballpark and so
 
01:31:11.689 --> 01:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
what Mr lippman has done when he's
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned the 80 20 rule is he's just
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
done a down and dirt 30 hear the things
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
with the biggest impact that I can get
 
01:31:20.689 --> 01:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
to in the least amount of time and I
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate you scrambling and so there's
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
going to be questions we may ask that
 
01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
you don't have the answer for because
 
01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
you just haven't had the time so I want
 
01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
to thank you for your patience and and
 
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
your Indulgence I appreciate the
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
question somebody over here has a
 
01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:36.790 align:start position:0%
question somebody over here has a
question

01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham you got your
 
01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
mic on yeah it's on thank you a couple
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
of couple of areas I have questions of
 
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
what they are first under transportation
 
01:31:50.209 --> 01:31:50.219 align:start position:0%
systems including ambulance and uh you
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
know I know the national ambulance fee
 
01:31:55.729 --> 01:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
schedule is uh the biggest mess of any
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
Medicare fee schedule right now some
 
01:31:59.810 --> 01:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
pleased to see that it's a high
 
01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
percentage but what do you mean by
 
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
medical and surgical supplies in the
 
01:32:06.770 --> 01:32:06.780 align:start position:0%
same groups so I think that this is a
 
01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
very small category and I have an
 
01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
ambulance example on slide
 
01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:11.750 align:start position:0%
ambulance example on slide
um

01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:14.689 --> 01:32:14.699 align:start position:0%
47 because our ambulance rates were very
 
01:32:17.209 --> 01:32:17.219 align:start position:0%
are not good that that's I think there's
 
01:32:19.010 --> 01:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
a small number of dollars in that last
 
01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:20.750 align:start position:0%
a small number of dollars in that last
category

01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
category
 
01:32:23.810 --> 01:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
um that's related to supplies and you
 
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
know as I think uh commodities
 
01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:29.219 align:start position:0%
whereas we haven't Revisited our fee
 
01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
schedule at time I think some of the
 
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
supplies in in uh
 
01:32:35.930 --> 01:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
that are used by ambulances are are
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
probably haven't reflected how the
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
market has evolved in some of those
 
01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
categories of uh Commodities but the the
 
01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
service but the people going to the
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
house or going to the facility and
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
picking someone up and taking them
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere else are reflected on slide 47
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
where we were you know the major
 
01:32:57.530 --> 01:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
categories a low of 22 percent of
 
01:33:00.290 --> 01:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
Medicare to a high of 38 percent of
 
01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:01.330 align:start position:0%
Medicare to a high of 38 percent of
Medicare

01:33:01.330 --> 01:33:01.340 align:start position:0%
Medicare
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
the last session we we increased that to
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
50 percent of Medicare was what was
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
approved in the special session last
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
session to increase those rates but I
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
can tell you just
 
01:33:16.370 --> 01:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
that I'm just this past week I had three
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
nursing homes reach out to us that said
 
01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
you know the ambulance provider no
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
longer will do the what I call the chair
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
car services
 
01:33:26.689 --> 01:33:26.699 align:start position:0%
um on a regular basis because they can't
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
staff it they can't afford to do it at
 
01:33:31.669 --> 01:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
the rates that that we have and you know
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
that's been a perennial issue and if you
 
01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
look around other states I think you
 
01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
sounds like you have some sense of like
 
01:33:39.410 --> 01:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and what they've
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
experienced that uh
 
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
um and Maine that that ambulance
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
providers are having a hard time hanging
 
01:33:48.649 --> 01:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
in the market here and we've seen that
 
01:33:50.570 --> 01:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
more recently during some of the Surge
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
and not covered but just
 
01:33:55.490 --> 01:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
surge because of lack hospitals have
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
told us they've had a hard time moving
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm just more familiar with the
 
01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
with the national uh ambulance effort to
 
01:34:10.010 --> 01:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
understand costs they can redo that the
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
the Medicare rates but yeah not what's
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
going on in Mass for example
 
01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
um the other two I have questions for in
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
here temporary codes from the dmercs uh
 
01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:25.400 align:start position:0%
this is still bound 44. so
 
01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
there's durable medical equipment those
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
are usually managed by Meridian or one
 
01:34:32.810 --> 01:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
of the durable medical equipment
 
01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
regional carriers
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
and um I don't know what a temporary
 
01:34:40.129 --> 01:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
code is for them so it may have created
 
01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
or it may be as you know sometimes with
 
01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:45.590 align:start position:0%
or it may be as you know sometimes with
with

01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
um equipment and things that CMS signs a
 
01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
temporary code until there's more
 
01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
experience so
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
most of our population that get health
 
01:34:58.129 --> 01:34:58.139 align:start position:0%
insurance except for typically two
 
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
thousand to four thousand people are
 
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
getting it through the Managed Care
 
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
Organization so of the 250 000 people
 
01:35:06.530 --> 01:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
you know this is a very small percentage
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
for for very specific reasons that don't
 
01:35:11.209 --> 01:35:11.219 align:start position:0%
go on the regular Managed Care Program
 
01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
and you're right that the the DME is
 
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
managed through the mcos and their
 
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
subcarriers that you reference one of
 
01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:20.570 align:start position:0%
subcarriers that you reference one of
them

01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:22.189 align:start position:0%
them
um

01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
again I think
 
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
the in terms of the time frame to put
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
this together the some level of detail
 
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
that I haven't been able to fully get to
 
01:35:33.169 --> 01:35:33.179 align:start position:0%
okay that's
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to jump if I can one more
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
question in terms of the you know
 
01:35:40.129 --> 01:35:40.139 align:start position:0%
there's three contracts that we have in
 
01:35:43.129 --> 01:35:43.139 align:start position:0%
there that over over many years that
 
01:35:45.649 --> 01:35:45.659 align:start position:0%
total about five billion dollars for the
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
three mcos
 
01:35:47.639 --> 01:35:48.229 align:start position:0%
three mcos
um

01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh so I assume most of what they get
 
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
they're spent giving out to Providers uh
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
how how are they rewarded or compensated
 
01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
is it just a straight percentage over
 
01:36:04.669 --> 01:36:04.679 align:start position:0%
the top or their quality qualifiers is
 
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
there anything you can talk about on
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
that and how how that rolls into the
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
budget sure so New Hampshire approaches
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
its rate setting the mcos are in effect
 
01:36:16.129 --> 01:36:16.139 align:start position:0%
price takers are we work with our
 
01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
actuary based on experience and we say
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
this is what we're willing to pay and we
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
take into account that this variation
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
among the mcos and and their efficiency
 
01:36:29.209 --> 01:36:29.219 align:start position:0%
we don't build it each MCO get their own
 
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
rate it's built off of it's built off
 
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
experience in different rate cells or
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
different categories of eligibility
 
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
the way that our state is currently
 
01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:39.850 align:start position:0%
the way that our state is currently
managed

01:36:39.850 --> 01:36:39.860 align:start position:0%
managed
 
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
approximately 89 percent
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
of the capitation rate goes to
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
delivering paying providers
 
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's a one and a half percent
 
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
um profit margin that's built into the
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
rate potential
 
01:36:57.770 --> 01:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
um and then there's a two percent
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
premium tax that is built into the rate
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
that's required and then the balance
 
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
which is about eight percent varies
 
01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:07.570 align:start position:0%
which is about eight percent varies
between

01:37:07.570 --> 01:37:07.580 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
7.6 and 8.5 depending on the the
 
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
category is is for the administration of
 
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
the program
 
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:37:20.090 --> 01:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
we have all the contracts are the same
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
there's no no difference between the
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
mcos we set one one contract
 
01:37:28.850 --> 01:37:28.860 align:start position:0%
one rate and
 
01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
um we currently have
 
01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:31.910 align:start position:0%
um we currently have
um

01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:36.129 --> 01:37:36.139 align:start position:0%
risk card is in place to protect against
 
01:37:40.129 --> 01:37:40.139 align:start position:0%
and over the the law has an 85 minimum
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
threshold with respect to spending on
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
the program we've actually because we've
 
01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
put in a risk card or we've pushed that
 
01:37:51.770 --> 01:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
up to 89 percent in terms of being spent
 
01:37:54.530 --> 01:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
so that would be a follow-up so that
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
would be something risk court or
 
01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
something like an end-stage renal
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
disease patient or it's it's somebody's
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
in a high-risk category and you expect
 
01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
their expenditures to be higher is that
 
01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
the idea so that we do have what we call
 
01:38:09.110 --> 01:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
stop loss right that's um but we also
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
have a risk card which is the total
 
01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
spend basically was the premium Priced
 
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
Right to begin with and during the
 
01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
during the the 2019 period starting for
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
us in our contract beginning September
 
01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:27.620 align:start position:0%
of 19. we've had protections against
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
underutilization leading to excess
 
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
profits for the mcos
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
we've built in this risk card situation
 
01:38:39.410 --> 01:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
so that if there was low utilization the
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
state's protected from overpaying
 
01:38:46.090 --> 01:38:46.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.530 --> 01:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
representative erf
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
I thank you
 
01:38:52.729 --> 01:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
so we talk about the rates
 
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
is it the Medicare the average with
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
regard to Medicare rate or is it another
 
01:38:59.689 --> 01:38:59.699 align:start position:0%
rate is it a percentage is absolute
 
01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
number and where would we find them so
 
01:39:02.570 --> 01:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
um a basis where you can get a site
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
where you can get our fee schedule it's
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
like 13 000 codes as I mentioned on it
 
01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:11.270 align:start position:0%
like 13 000 codes as I mentioned on it
um

01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:15.530 --> 01:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
the um the mco's typically use that as a
 
01:39:17.689 --> 01:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
basis of their negotiation
 
01:39:21.169 --> 01:39:21.179 align:start position:0%
with providers and so typically
 
01:39:21.179 --> 01:39:22.010 align:start position:0%
with providers and so typically
um

01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
the the average price is typically
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
around 101 to 102 is what they end up
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
paying providers almost in all
 
01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
categories there's some categories where
 
01:39:34.250 --> 01:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
they can negotiate better because the
 
01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:35.270 align:start position:0%
they can negotiate better because the
market

01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
but generally it averages about 101 to
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
102 percent of our fee schedule is what
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
they're paying
 
01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
for services sometimes it's in the form
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:39:49.729 --> 01:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
a drg a fixed global payment or
 
01:39:51.649 --> 01:39:51.659 align:start position:0%
not the cases it may be a shadow
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:59.209 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:39:59.209 --> 01:39:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:40:02.810 --> 01:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
they generally are following the fee
 
01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:03.770 align:start position:0%
they generally are following the fee
schedule

01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
so when you're increasing rates across
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
the board 3.1 percent what what are you
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
multiplying by 3.1 percent or 103.1 you
 
01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
have to go ahead I'll
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
code times the use rate
 
01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:18.950 align:start position:0%
code times the use rate
times

01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
um to come up with what the impact is
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
and that's that's a level of detail that
 
01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
we have to to get to
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay and do you have a sense is is that
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere in here a sense of which rates
 
01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
sort of the range from
 
01:40:39.290 --> 01:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
furthest from right to closest to right
 
01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
so we have you know in decades we've
 
01:40:45.410 --> 01:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
never had that opportunity to look at a
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
targeted rate increase
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
um and I think the issues that we face
 
01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
in terms of managing the the fee
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
schedule is a function that
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
that we haven't been able to do that
 
01:40:58.970 --> 01:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
it's something that needs to be done
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's long long overdue and we want to
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
come up with a more consistent way it's
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
not going to be fixed in one one year I
 
01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
don't I understand that or one budget
 
01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
but are there obvious ones that are way
 
01:41:15.290 --> 01:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
too low or obvious ones that are really
 
01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
pretty close
 
01:41:19.129 --> 01:41:19.139 align:start position:0%
there yes I I think I can give you some
 
01:41:21.410 --> 01:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
examples of where
 
01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
um in the sheet I have if I can pass it
 
01:41:28.490 --> 01:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:29.930 --> 01:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
and I'll just add what the chairman said
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
this is excellent to get down to this
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
level of understanding in the years I've
 
01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
been here I've not gotten this this
 
01:41:38.570 --> 01:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
depth of understanding and and I think I
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
think I had a question there so what
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
let's assume let's pretend for a moment
 
01:41:45.530 --> 01:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
that we were able to come up with a
 
01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
targeted fee structure change that that
 
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
the the division and the finance
 
01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
committee would be behind what does that
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
look like are you guys getting ready to
 
01:41:57.530 --> 01:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
renegotiate your MCO contracts and would
 
01:42:00.890 --> 01:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
this be like an addendum to say you know
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
here here's what we're reimbursing
 
01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
please implement this in your in your
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
scrub your payment structures is that
 
01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:09.179 align:start position:0%
what what what what's the what's the
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle to get from our decisions to
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
actual payments to providers so we would
 
01:42:18.649 --> 01:42:18.659 align:start position:0%
work with our actuary we would give them
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
the new fee schedule and they would look
 
01:42:24.649 --> 01:42:24.659 align:start position:0%
at buy eligibility group what the impact
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
is based on the utilization for that
 
01:42:29.450 --> 01:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
particular group like people who are in
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
nursing homes have a different pattern
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
of utilization than children and so
 
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
depending on how you move the codes
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
for a particular rate it's going to
 
01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
impact those different rate cells
 
01:42:40.609 --> 01:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
differently but every time the
 
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
legislature does sort of a one-off
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
increase like with the ambulance or with
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
maternity care the next time we do a
 
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
contract Amendment we usually been doing
 
01:42:52.129 --> 01:42:52.139 align:start position:0%
one for July 1 and 1 at January so that
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
we're picking up both um
 
01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:57.659 align:start position:0%
the budget and the uh any subsequent
 
01:42:59.930 --> 01:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
session so we typically are mending the
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
contract two times a year we're
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
currently the current MCO vendors the
 
01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
current procurement ends August of 24 so
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
we're right now planning for our next
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
procurement but whatever rate change the
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
legislature makes we'll take that back
 
01:43:18.530 --> 01:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
and work with our people and their team
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
to come up with a a pretty precise
 
01:43:24.530 --> 01:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
impact of what if you say we could get
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
17 million or 100 million or whatever
 
01:43:29.689 --> 01:43:29.699 align:start position:0%
the number is that that we can come back
 
01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
to you and say this is how it would be
 
01:43:36.370 --> 01:43:36.380 align:start position:0%
spread out and we would use
 
01:43:40.010 --> 01:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
so my I love the explanation but as I'm
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
listening to that I'm concerned that as
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
a division we basically only have one
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
shot at it ourselves that we we have to
 
01:43:53.689 --> 01:43:53.699 align:start position:0%
we have to finish our work by the end of
 
01:43:53.699 --> 01:43:54.590 align:start position:0%
we have to finish our work by the end of
March

01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
March
 
01:43:58.910 --> 01:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
and then whatever we give to the process
 
01:44:01.729 --> 01:44:01.739 align:start position:0%
is still has to go through an Actuarial
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
review to determine what the real impact
 
01:44:05.159 --> 01:44:06.109 align:start position:0%
review to determine what the real impact
is

01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:44:09.290 --> 01:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
would I should I be concerned that we
 
01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
might make some targeted changes and we
 
01:44:14.209 --> 01:44:14.219 align:start position:0%
might break something
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
so what if I were to in sitting in your
 
01:44:18.290 --> 01:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
seats and trying to make the decision
 
01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
it's sort of what what can you afford to
 
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
you knowing what what's out there what
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear right what in the
 
01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:28.739 align:start position:0%
the larger budget can you afford to
 
01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
invest in them we would then translate
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
that to the best in trying to remedy
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
some of these gaps between where we are
 
01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
with Medicare in certain instances and
 
01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
um you know I apologize for the size of
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
what's in front of you but this is just
 
01:44:47.450 --> 01:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
the taking the Professional Services for
 
01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
2022 looking at the top getting to that
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
80 percent
 
01:44:54.250 --> 01:44:54.260 align:start position:0%
um ratio if you look at the far far
 
01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
right uh the bottom column when you get
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
to the bottom we've hit 80 percent of
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
the the the the number and then
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
oh nice
 
01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
so we would repeat this for each of the
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
categories so to give you some idea on
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
the pool of money we're talking about
 
01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
this is about I'm I'm talking that we
 
01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
would still try to figure out what the
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
governor's 3.1 percent creates in terms
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
of incremental funds available for
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
distribution and that we would be
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
looking at potential reallocation within
 
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
the same pool I heard you say that some
 
01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:35.239 align:start position:0%
people most people nearly every people
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
thinks it's got to be more than 3.1
 
01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
percent but at least in the first pass I
 
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
don't think we should be assuming 11
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
percent or any other percent other than
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.970 --> 01:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
a direct correlation there are some
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
places where we actually a little bit
 
01:45:59.890 --> 01:45:59.900 align:start position:0%
higher than where Medicare is currently
 
01:46:03.169 --> 01:46:03.179 align:start position:0%
there's some places like in delivering a
 
01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
baby where we're half of what
 
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
um where we might want to be so I think
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's a very so just just give us two
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
examples of each where you would make an
 
01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
increase and where you might do a
 
01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:17.930 align:start position:0%
increase and where you might do a
decrement

01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
decrement
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
so if you
 
01:46:25.370 --> 01:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
um it's uh code 59400 it's about
 
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
I'd say two-thirds of the way down it's
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
obstetrical care wait a second wait a
 
01:46:33.169 --> 01:46:33.179 align:start position:0%
second wait till we get on our fingers
 
01:46:34.129 --> 01:46:34.139 align:start position:0%
on it
 
01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:35.900 align:start position:0%
it's in between codes
 
01:46:40.729 --> 01:46:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.739 --> 01:46:42.050 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:46:43.790 --> 01:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:47.169 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
so

01:46:47.169 --> 01:46:47.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
oh yeah thank you
 
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.149 align:start position:0%
oh yeah thank you
it's

01:46:52.149 --> 01:46:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:46:55.490 --> 01:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
74.7 Prince thank you okay so that's a
 
01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
obstetrical care you're talking about we
 
01:47:00.169 --> 01:47:00.179 align:start position:0%
know that we've seen
 
01:47:03.129 --> 01:47:03.139 align:start position:0%
um in the state we're down 11
 
01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
obstetrical units for and we know that
 
01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:09.719 align:start position:0%
uh this challenges uh for people to get
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
maternity care and if you look at our
 
01:47:14.689 --> 01:47:14.699 align:start position:0%
fee against the what Medicare fee for
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:47:17.810 --> 01:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
um you know we can see we're just about
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
half of that so so where am I seeing a
 
01:47:24.169 --> 01:47:24.179 align:start position:0%
increase the recommended increase it's
 
01:47:27.169 --> 01:47:27.179 align:start position:0%
not on this okay it increases here yeah
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
this is just this is just as is as is
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
yes okay so and I now understanding that
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
what you're comparing is Medicaid to
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
Medicare fee that's that's a starting
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
point where we can
 
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
um okay so for example the top the very
 
01:47:45.290 --> 01:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
top one is the case management for that
 
01:47:47.450 --> 01:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
the mental health centers provide over
 
01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
the course of a month there's not a a
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
comparable to Medicare on that one
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
um that that would be appropriate
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
so okay so I got it I I know what the
 
01:48:01.790 --> 01:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
limitation of that number is what's the
 
01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
second one that you think might be a
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
target for increase
 
01:48:05.639 --> 01:48:06.770 align:start position:0%
target for increase
um

01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
and there's more than two I'm sure I'm
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
just trying to get a feel for the
 
01:48:10.679 --> 01:48:11.689 align:start position:0%
just trying to get a feel for the
document

01:48:11.689 --> 01:48:11.699 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:48:14.450 --> 01:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
so um if you look like four from the
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
bottom speech therapy
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
um you know where Medicare is at 24.48
 
01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh medicaids at 16 20.
 
01:48:27.709 --> 01:48:27.719 align:start position:0%
um we know schools Medicaid schools that
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
we're trying to help kids with in the
 
01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:33.719 align:start position:0%
school setting it might be a good one to
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
to help with we know there's a Workforce
 
01:48:38.209 --> 01:48:38.219 align:start position:0%
shortage there it might be a good code
 
01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:41.109 align:start position:0%
to address
um

01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:43.129 --> 01:48:43.139 align:start position:0%
so what is the rest of this table
 
01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
showings you go across
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
so it's just orienting there the top
 
01:48:50.890 --> 01:48:50.900 align:start position:0%
does the procedure code AS defined then
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
a description the description sometimes
 
01:48:55.010 --> 01:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
not the best but that's what's in the
 
01:48:58.010 --> 01:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
system then we have the Medicaid fee the
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
current fee schedule as it consists
 
01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:00.910 align:start position:0%
current fee schedule as it consists
today

01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:49:04.370 --> 01:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
Medicare fees as they exist today the
 
01:49:08.450 --> 01:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
then there's uh two columns standard and
 
01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
Grant GA hcp stands for granted
 
01:49:13.570 --> 01:49:13.580 align:start position:0%
Advantage Healthcare program under the
 
01:49:15.890 --> 01:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
MCM program meaning the Managed Care
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
organizations that's the spending that
 
01:49:21.770 --> 01:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
occurs for that code in in managed care
 
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
and then to the total span for 2022 in
 
01:49:27.890 --> 01:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
that yes okay and then for
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
um there's a fee some FIFA service
 
01:49:31.250 --> 01:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
population particularly you know we
 
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
talked about in and out Medicaid earlier
 
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.970 align:start position:0%
talked about in and out Medicaid earlier
that

01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:36.530 --> 01:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who use the in and out
 
01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:37.669 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who use the in and out
medicator

01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
medicator
 
01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
often people that have are
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
using the mental health center so you
 
01:49:45.729 --> 01:49:45.739 align:start position:0%
see a good amount of FIFA service
 
01:49:48.890 --> 01:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
in that category and then it's totaled
 
01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
across the across the way and then to
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
the final cumulative percentage that
 
01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
that one code represents almost 12
 
01:49:59.209 --> 01:49:59.219 align:start position:0%
percent of our entire spend in that
 
01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
and these are all these are all
 
01:50:06.649 --> 01:50:06.659 align:start position:0%
Professional Services these are all
 
01:50:08.930 --> 01:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
Professional Services the top to get to
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
80 percent
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
um and so this should be repeated of all
 
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
the categories and um
 
01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
and then you know I think that uh
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
again just comparing it to Medicare and
 
01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
then comparing it to other states
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes isn't enough you have to take
 
01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:29.699 align:start position:0%
it further
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
more specifically regard to all the ones
 
01:50:33.290 --> 01:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
that are blank underneath Medicaid yeah
 
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
Medicare rather what do you compare them
 
01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
to so that's where often looking at
 
01:50:40.129 --> 01:50:40.139 align:start position:0%
other State Medicaid programs would make
 
01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
sense okay so so when you said we ought
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
to look at all the categories here
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
referring to the categories listed on
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
page 41 of the colored handout
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
were professional as a third one down
 
01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
and you got inpatient Hospital
 
01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
outpatient facility
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy Dental Nursing Facility are
 
01:51:01.729 --> 01:51:01.739 align:start position:0%
those the other categories that you
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
would do something similar if time
 
01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:04.910 align:start position:0%
would do something similar if time
permitted

01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
01:51:07.310 --> 01:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
um the very last page would be would tie
 
01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
to this slide 50 would be
 
01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
we looked at
 
01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
that one category Professional Services
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
we would look at
 
01:51:19.129 --> 01:51:19.139 align:start position:0%
all of these and we might choose to
 
01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
break it down different than here but I
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
just again trying to get something
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
together for you this is a grouping that
 
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:31.970 --> 01:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
okay and you took a you took a big
 
01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
number yep
 
01:51:36.770 --> 01:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
and waiver services at 5 18 that's a
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
bigger number but you didn't pick it
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
what's unique about waiver services that
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
it didn't handle this
 
01:51:46.609 --> 01:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
um if I again if I had another 24 hours
 
01:51:48.169 --> 01:51:48.179 align:start position:0%
we might have been able to pull together
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
I do have waiver Services
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
um but I haven't got to the level of
 
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
putting in other comparators they just
 
01:51:57.770 --> 01:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
have the pure 80 percent if you want
 
01:52:03.850 --> 01:52:03.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
let me just finish this and then we'll
 
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
come okay so so just just touch the two
 
01:52:12.530 --> 01:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
that you would indicate this is the hard
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
one it's always easy to talk about the
 
01:52:18.050 --> 01:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
potential increases what do you see any
 
01:52:22.010 --> 01:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
Bill payers
 
01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
this gets to sort of the art of some
 
01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
things right that
 
01:52:32.689 --> 01:52:32.699 align:start position:0%
um to decrease a fee in Medicaid is
 
01:52:35.450 --> 01:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes a a process that you have to
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
do go through and get approvals the way
 
01:52:40.490 --> 01:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
I would generally approach this is the
 
01:52:43.370 --> 01:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
ones that are above or
 
01:52:45.530 --> 01:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
or too high at this point I would just
 
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
leave them alone and let time take care
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
of them would be one approach if we
 
01:52:52.129 --> 01:52:52.139 align:start position:0%
really felt there was a lot of money it
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
might be worth going through the process
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
so let's do the first thing tell me two
 
01:53:08.890 --> 01:53:08.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:15.770 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:53:15.770 --> 01:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:53:23.570 --> 01:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
I think it's h
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
63 level right because where it is
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
um you know we're at 112 29 on that fee
 
01:53:41.209 --> 01:53:41.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:43.609 --> 01:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
what's the name of this service
 
01:53:46.430 --> 01:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
it is it's got a sort of a cryptic
 
01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:49.870 align:start position:0%
it is it's got a sort of a cryptic
Family

01:53:49.870 --> 01:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
Psychological treatment with a patient
 
01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
50 minutes
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
but here again this might be a good
 
01:53:59.149 --> 01:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
example where you hear with the mental
 
01:54:01.609 --> 01:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
health provider shortage you wouldn't
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to cut the rate because
 
01:54:06.649 --> 01:54:06.659 align:start position:0%
you know take into account
 
01:54:06.659 --> 01:54:07.850 align:start position:0%
you know take into account
um

01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay so so without giving us a second
 
01:54:13.729 --> 01:54:13.739 align:start position:0%
one I think you just teed up a good
 
01:54:17.330 --> 01:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
division three conversation and and and
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
and what
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
it feels to me
 
01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:26.820 align:start position:0%
is that while this is a long overdue
 
01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
process of coming back and looking at
 
01:54:33.050 --> 01:54:33.060 align:start position:0%
the targeting of rates
 
01:54:36.410 --> 01:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
that the amount of time available is
 
01:54:39.890 --> 01:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
extremely limited and that if we were to
 
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
rush this project we would probably be
 
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
as likely to break something
 
01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
as we would be to fix something or in
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
the best case we might break something
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
in your actuarials will say no and it
 
01:54:57.169 --> 01:54:57.179 align:start position:0%
won't actually go into effect and we'll
 
01:54:59.810 --> 01:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
have just wasted our time and analyzing
 
01:55:02.450 --> 01:55:02.460 align:start position:0%
it that that's that's sort of what I
 
01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
feel is our situation is that is that
 
01:55:08.330 --> 01:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
close to your perception I would take
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
what you say but add to the to it I
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
think ultimately as saying our chairs is
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
that it's there definitely is I think a
 
01:55:18.719 --> 01:55:20.209 align:start position:0%
that it's there definitely is I think a
clamor

01:55:20.209 --> 01:55:20.219 align:start position:0%
clamor
 
01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
um out there and evidence of of gaps in
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
Service delivery
 
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
that suggests that it
 
01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
a dollar amount that you can fit into
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
the entire budget that we would go to
 
01:55:34.609 --> 01:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
work with utilizing these type of
 
01:55:36.890 --> 01:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
criteria and report to you on a regular
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
basis would be how we get to a point
 
01:55:41.229 --> 01:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
that I think you'd be comfortable with
 
01:55:44.090 --> 01:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
okay I think I'd left you hanging
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham yeah thanks
 
01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:47.330 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham yeah thanks
um

01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
um you know you talk about a percentage
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
of Medicare you know the Medicare fee
 
01:55:54.770 --> 01:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
schedules change every year sometimes
 
01:55:57.770 --> 01:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
the change within individual codes based
 
01:55:59.810 --> 01:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
on a changing methodology are pretty
 
01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:01.609 align:start position:0%
on a changing methodology are pretty
dramatic

01:56:01.609 --> 01:56:01.619 align:start position:0%
dramatic
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
um and I I I think maybe some of the
 
01:56:06.250 --> 01:56:06.260 align:start position:0%
numbers I'm seeing here there's been
 
01:56:09.229 --> 01:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
major revisions in the evaluation and
 
01:56:11.950 --> 01:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance management codes e m codes
 
01:56:14.570 --> 01:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
that have actually brought down the
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
Medicare rates a bit and when you apply
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
a 3.1 percent increase
 
01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
um or or whatever the number is now are
 
01:56:27.530 --> 01:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
you looking at what Medicare has done
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
are you pay it as a percentage of
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
Medicare are you just raising it three
 
01:56:34.850 --> 01:56:34.860 align:start position:0%
point one percent based on what Medicaid
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
was last year or most recent numbers
 
01:56:41.450 --> 01:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
that's the first question I had so
 
01:56:43.609 --> 01:56:43.619 align:start position:0%
um I'll answer two parts the the first
 
01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
part is in Prior rate increases we were
 
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
told by legislation
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
apply 3.1 to everything and don't don't
 
01:56:55.609 --> 01:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
deviate okay what we're we're suggesting
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
is it's
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
Beyond time where we have to to look at
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
these types of factors that I outline in
 
01:57:07.490 --> 01:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
my slide deck here to just to use the
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
money in a way that's going to have the
 
01:57:10.609 --> 01:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
biggest impact whatever that
 
01:57:13.490 --> 01:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
appropriation ends up being and Medicare
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
alone as you're right in certain
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
categories things change that's why I
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a one-factor analysis I
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
think it's a starting point
 
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:27.050 --> 01:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
representative just to restart what you
 
01:57:29.570 --> 01:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
said in terms that makes sense to me
 
01:57:31.370 --> 01:57:31.380 align:start position:0%
you would ask us to allocate some amount
 
01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
of money whatever like we could take the
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
3.1 figure whether that comes out to or
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
more or less whatever and ask you to go
 
01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
about resetting rates where you feel
 
01:57:44.089 --> 01:57:44.099 align:start position:0%
they would give us the biggest impact in
 
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
providing services to people in the
 
01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire exactly yeah and
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
and I I just want to point out and I
 
01:57:51.649 --> 01:57:51.659 align:start position:0%
think everybody in the room knows it I
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's fundamentally different
 
01:57:55.010 --> 01:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
than how things have historically in
 
01:57:56.570 --> 01:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
recent years been done where we've had a
 
01:57:58.370 --> 01:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
footnote that provided a five percent to
 
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
this party or legislation you know
 
01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
through the past biennium but you know
 
01:58:05.689 --> 01:58:05.699 align:start position:0%
what what we're proposing you know is do
 
01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
does the state consider a a policy that
 
01:58:12.109 --> 01:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
really takes the numbers into account
 
01:58:14.570 --> 01:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
and looks at the market rates and bases
 
01:58:16.970 --> 01:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
that those changes on objective
 
01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
informational that's quantifiable that's
 
01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:22.739 align:start position:0%
reliable and and and that that will make
 
01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
some people uncomfortable and and we're
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
proposing the concept we're you know
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
we're not endorsing it necessarily but
 
01:58:29.870 --> 01:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
we're proposing that as a concept and
 
01:58:32.330 --> 01:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
and what Henry and his team have done to
 
01:58:34.609 --> 01:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
put that kind of kind of visual together
 
01:58:37.490 --> 01:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
to show you what that would look like
 
01:58:38.570 --> 01:58:38.580 align:start position:0%
um you know we're just putting that out
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
there and um to see whether that would
 
01:58:42.890 --> 01:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
be considered or not
 
01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:44.330 align:start position:0%
be considered or not
so

01:58:44.330 --> 01:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:46.370 --> 01:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
um did you have follow-up
 
01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry well I got no I didn't like to
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
follow but I guess I would just say that
 
01:58:52.250 --> 01:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
that sort of addresses your concern that
 
01:58:54.410 --> 01:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be breaking anything we'd be
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
saying take these funds and you apply
 
01:58:58.370 --> 01:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
them the best way possible and I
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
actually like that approach compared to
 
01:59:02.570 --> 01:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
just saying up 3.1 right I'm I'm liking
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
it I'm just Expo I'm about to explore it
 
01:59:06.830 --> 01:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
a little further okay
 
01:59:08.689 --> 01:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry who did
 
01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:10.210 align:start position:0%
he's not here
 
01:59:10.210 --> 01:59:12.350 align:start position:0%
he's not here
[Laughter]

01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:13.750 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
okay

01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:59:16.189 --> 01:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
trailing representative Hole chairling
 
01:59:18.290 --> 01:59:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh all right
 
01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:19.430 align:start position:0%
uh all right
so

01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:21.649 --> 01:59:21.659 align:start position:0%
you've given us Professional Services
 
01:59:24.109 --> 01:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
and you've only given us 80 percent the
 
01:59:27.410 --> 01:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
top the the 80 the 80 that spends the
 
01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
money okay
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
this is a list as I eyeball it it feels
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
like it's about 50 line items 60 line
 
01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:36.609 align:start position:0%
like it's about 50 line items 60 line
items

01:59:36.609 --> 01:59:36.619 align:start position:0%
items
 
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred wow I think it's like 91
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
maybe okay so
 
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
just on this one sheet without taking
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
into hospital inpatient outpatient on
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
the other categories just on this
 
01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
Professional Services area
 
01:59:54.050 --> 01:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
how many of these do you think are in
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
crisis situation or near broken
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
to where
 
02:00:00.890 --> 02:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
it's really in the best interest of the
 
02:00:03.649 --> 02:00:03.659 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state to do a plus up
 
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
above the 3.1 percent base all of them
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
two of them
 
02:00:15.530 --> 02:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
so I I
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
look at it more
 
02:00:21.290 --> 02:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
I know you're asking me to give you an
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
answer that's specific to to code level
 
02:00:24.530 --> 02:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
I don't have all the use rates numbers
 
02:00:29.209 --> 02:00:29.219 align:start position:0%
in my head to say this it may be for
 
02:00:31.729 --> 02:00:31.739 align:start position:0%
example in in mental health there's two
 
02:00:33.770 --> 02:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
codes out of all of them that really are
 
02:00:35.390 --> 02:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
the difference in terms of what we're
 
02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
trying to do I
 
02:00:39.530 --> 02:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I would as much as I want to
 
02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
give you an answer that you're asking I
 
02:00:43.129 --> 02:00:43.139 align:start position:0%
don't have that today
 
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
um I can get that answer for you
 
02:00:47.089 --> 02:00:47.099 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's just not something that
 
02:00:49.010 --> 02:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
can be done in the time frame that we
 
02:00:51.649 --> 02:00:51.659 align:start position:0%
had to so I don't have ultimately on my
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
calendar how many days do you need to
 
02:00:59.209 --> 02:00:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.219 --> 02:01:00.589 align:start position:0%
 
to

02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
I think that we need
 
02:01:02.639 --> 02:01:03.169 align:start position:0%
I think that we need
um

02:01:03.169 --> 02:01:03.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:05.689 --> 02:01:05.699 align:start position:0%
a period that go extends to do the full
 
02:01:05.699 --> 02:01:06.530 align:start position:0%
a period that go extends to do the full
job

02:01:06.530 --> 02:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
job
 
02:01:08.570 --> 02:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
if you're asking us to do the full job
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's mine eighty percent of the job
 
02:01:16.250 --> 02:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.050 --> 02:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
category here
 
02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:19.790 align:start position:0%
category here
person

02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:01:22.370 --> 02:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
um who does rates as a specialty and
 
02:01:23.390 --> 02:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
they have
 
02:01:26.330 --> 02:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
other day-to-day activities in terms of
 
02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
um as representative Earth knows to to
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
do pro share and M quip and all those
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
other things so so we're out of this
 
02:01:35.330 --> 02:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
budget cycle no no no no no this is I'm
 
02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
asking him I think the point is to for
 
02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:38.390 align:start position:0%
asking him I think the point is to for
us

02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:01:41.330 --> 02:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
to decide to give him a supplement yeah
 
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
I know I hear that but I don't know that
 
02:01:45.530 --> 02:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
we could give him a supplement and not
 
02:01:47.089 --> 02:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
want to hear back what are you going to
 
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
do with it why I would you come to
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal oh
 
02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
I don't know it feels to me like public
 
02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
transparency when we're setting uh some
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
special rates that we ought to at least
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
in you know open that up and subject to
 
02:02:04.129 --> 02:02:04.139 align:start position:0%
a more public property we depend on them
 
02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
to do all these waivers and all this
 
02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
stuff into independently of us I'm
 
02:02:10.129 --> 02:02:10.139 align:start position:0%
listening so you you think you think
 
02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
you'd be comfortable absolutely we're
 
02:02:12.119 --> 02:02:13.390 align:start position:0%
you'd be comfortable absolutely we're
just

02:02:13.390 --> 02:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:21.290 --> 02:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative would you would you give
 
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
them a pot of money to allocate how they
 
02:02:26.089 --> 02:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
saw fit crisis I'm not going to answer
 
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
that I am going to say that they're the
 
02:02:30.890 --> 02:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
experts on this and to some extent we
 
02:02:33.229 --> 02:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
can't be micromanaging every single line
 
02:02:33.239 --> 02:02:34.250 align:start position:0%
can't be micromanaging every single line
item

02:02:34.250 --> 02:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
item
 
02:02:36.770 --> 02:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
on this and however we agree 100 Pages
 
02:02:38.930 --> 02:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
we agree but but that's not really the
 
02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
issue that we have to deal with I think
 
02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
we we should should we be prepared to
 
02:02:45.229 --> 02:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
talk to see if there's some amount of
 
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
money we want to give them to let them
 
02:02:49.129 --> 02:02:49.139 align:start position:0%
allocate it without them coming back and
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
tell us and how they're going to do it
 
02:02:53.089 --> 02:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
I think that's something we need to
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
discuss yeah so I'm trying to do that
 
02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:57.719 align:start position:0%
representative Waller yes sir at this
 
02:02:59.089 --> 02:02:59.099 align:start position:0%
point we don't even know if we're going
 
02:03:00.530 --> 02:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
to have an increase
 
02:03:02.510 --> 02:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
in Revenue
 
02:03:06.649 --> 02:03:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.209 --> 02:03:08.219 align:start position:0%
they're so slow that what's going to
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
come down to is okay traditionally HHS
 
02:03:16.250 --> 02:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
gets 51.52 percent of the of the budget
 
02:03:18.169 --> 02:03:18.179 align:start position:0%
what do we have for a new
 
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue how many is it is it an increase
 
02:03:23.870 --> 02:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
if it's an increase maybe they get 52
 
02:03:26.209 --> 02:03:26.219 align:start position:0%
percent of it or whatever the normal
 
02:03:28.010 --> 02:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
thing is that's about all we can do
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
everybody is putting it to us and giving
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
us everything late we still don't have
 
02:03:34.250 --> 02:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
hb2 we still don't have the revenue
 
02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:35.750 align:start position:0%
hb2 we still don't have the revenue
estimates

02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
02:03:37.370 --> 02:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
if if we're going to make a deadline
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be going line by line
 
02:03:41.689 --> 02:03:41.699 align:start position:0%
on any of this stuff it's almost going
 
02:03:43.209 --> 02:03:43.219 align:start position:0%
to be down to
 
02:03:45.709 --> 02:03:45.719 align:start position:0%
you're going to get 52 percent of the
 
02:03:47.450 --> 02:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
increase or whatever the whatever the
 
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
amount is come back to us with a plan
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have the plan just give
 
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
us something rough because everybody is
 
02:03:57.410 --> 02:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
sticking it to us by giving us
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
everything late
 
02:04:04.129 --> 02:04:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
I hear you are there other comments
 
02:04:07.679 --> 02:04:09.410 align:start position:0%
I hear you are there other comments
so

02:04:09.410 --> 02:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:11.209 --> 02:04:11.219 align:start position:0%
how would we do
 
02:04:13.129 --> 02:04:13.139 align:start position:0%
look I'm sorry
 
02:04:15.050 --> 02:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
oh represent an order I didn't see you
 
02:04:17.629 --> 02:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
go ahead that's I'm I was a little slow
 
02:04:19.010 --> 02:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
on the draw
 
02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think we need to take a little
 
02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
more time
 
02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
and and I would agree with
 
02:04:28.729 --> 02:04:28.739 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler that
 
02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
we can't expect them to come up with the
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
numbers that quickly so I think we need
 
02:04:37.010 --> 02:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
to just this is our first day with them
 
02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:38.450 align:start position:0%
to just this is our first day with them
so

02:04:38.450 --> 02:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
you need to give them a chance to digest
 
02:04:43.550 --> 02:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
what we need and what they can give us
 
02:04:45.890 --> 02:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
in a time frame
 
02:04:48.649 --> 02:04:48.659 align:start position:0%
so I think we've heard them say it's
 
02:04:51.770 --> 02:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
going to take them months and and I I
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
think I've heard the idea that seems the
 
02:04:58.010 --> 02:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
most rational to me is that we leave a
 
02:05:01.010 --> 02:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent blanket alone that's the
 
02:05:03.649 --> 02:05:03.659 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal we leave that alone
 
02:05:06.290 --> 02:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
but that we consider
 
02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
an additional
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
allocation of Medicaid related money to
 
02:05:17.629 --> 02:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
ask the department to go in and help
 
02:05:21.290 --> 02:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
mitigate some of the worst aspects of
 
02:05:24.890 --> 02:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
our rates as they exist now I I think
 
02:05:27.229 --> 02:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at and if we're there
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious because I haven't
 
02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
thought of it how would we decide how
 
02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
much money that might be I guess we have
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
to wait for you know what you're you're
 
02:05:36.890 --> 02:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
talking about we don't we don't know
 
02:05:38.810 --> 02:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
what we don't know
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay so at some point we'll have to
 
02:05:43.729 --> 02:05:43.739 align:start position:0%
figure out what a a bucket would look
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
like and how to fill it how big who
 
02:05:49.490 --> 02:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
else's questions represent uh Stringham
 
02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
I you know I just think a related thing
 
02:05:54.410 --> 02:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
that they've hinted on before is that
 
02:05:58.030 --> 02:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
the possibility that some fee schedules
 
02:06:01.070 --> 02:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
access issues could be
 
02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:01.850 align:start position:0%
access issues could be
um

02:06:01.850 --> 02:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
could be such that they may need to
 
02:06:06.290 --> 02:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
think about whether the fee schedule
 
02:06:09.290 --> 02:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
should be consistent if somebody is only
 
02:06:12.169 --> 02:06:12.179 align:start position:0%
doing 20 percent or less of Medicaid
 
02:06:15.890 --> 02:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
versus uh 50 or more and
 
02:06:20.209 --> 02:06:20.219 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know such that the the
 
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
um the provider can't can't survive at
 
02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
the uh 20 for provider could survive in
 
02:06:32.089 --> 02:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
a 50 or an 80 percent provider uh might
 
02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
not so uh there's plenty of avenues for
 
02:06:40.070 --> 02:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh for HHS to walk with us even Beyond
 
02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:41.570 align:start position:0%
uh for HHS to walk with us even Beyond
uh

02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:45.649 --> 02:06:45.659 align:start position:0%
um jiggling all the individual rates I
 
02:06:47.209 --> 02:06:47.219 align:start position:0%
think they probably are going to start
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
where they see dramatic access issues in
 
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
one form or another so I'm I'm tracking
 
02:06:54.290 --> 02:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
what you're saying I'm agreeing with
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
what you're saying and I'm on page 43 of
 
02:06:58.490 --> 02:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
the colored handout where they've listed
 
02:07:00.890 --> 02:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
their rate setting approach to targeted
 
02:07:03.850 --> 02:07:03.860 align:start position:0%
rate increase the third one is access
 
02:07:07.850 --> 02:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
assess access issues to Providers what
 
02:07:10.729 --> 02:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
you're saying I think is amplifies that
 
02:07:14.089 --> 02:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
step by talking about those critical
 
02:07:17.810 --> 02:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
access issues the ones where we we may
 
02:07:20.689 --> 02:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
be near uh I hate using the word
 
02:07:23.209 --> 02:07:23.219 align:start position:0%
collapse too often but where we have a
 
02:07:26.089 --> 02:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
real problem with access
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
and a representative hole thank you kind
 
02:07:33.229 --> 02:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
of a little bit of the tangent can I can
 
02:07:36.830 --> 02:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
I do a time check I just it it's 1206
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to get back here at one
 
02:07:42.050 --> 02:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh I want to logically wrap up where
 
02:07:44.149 --> 02:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
we're at so we can go take a break and
 
02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
if we if people want to caucus also
 
02:07:48.050 --> 02:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
before we come back at one I want to
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
leave some time for that so so let's
 
02:07:52.729 --> 02:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
just take a few minutes if we can go go
 
02:07:55.550 --> 02:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
ahead sure so
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
um I've heard not sure if it's true or
 
02:08:00.290 --> 02:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
not that within the counseling domain
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's a large number of no-show type
 
02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:05.149 align:start position:0%
there's a large number of no-show type
appointments

02:08:05.149 --> 02:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
02:08:07.729 --> 02:08:07.739 align:start position:0%
um can you speak if if that is the case
 
02:08:09.410 --> 02:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
can you speak to it and then what do we
 
02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
do relative to the rate schedule and
 
02:08:14.689 --> 02:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
reimbursements etc for missed
 
02:08:14.699 --> 02:08:16.550 align:start position:0%
reimbursements etc for missed
appointments

02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
it's a good issue I don't have a direct
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
answer to counseling but the point that
 
02:08:23.930 --> 02:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
you're making was made in the dental
 
02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
situation because
 
02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
um it's very expensive for a dentist to
 
02:08:30.649 --> 02:08:30.659 align:start position:0%
have an unfilled uh chair and part of
 
02:08:32.990 --> 02:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
the design of that benefit includes Care
 
02:08:35.629 --> 02:08:35.639 align:start position:0%
Management and transportation to make
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
sure that they get there I think in
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
terms of counseling
 
02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
um that's a pretty broad one but I think
 
02:08:43.370 --> 02:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
in some instances that's what that
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
number one
 
02:08:47.209 --> 02:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
um on that list of Professional Services
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
that Community Mental Health Centers
 
02:08:51.530 --> 02:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
provide is that sort of care
 
02:08:53.870 --> 02:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
coordination and Care Management it's
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
for some populations it's really
 
02:08:58.609 --> 02:08:58.619 align:start position:0%
important to to get it there and
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and there's not a lot of Leverage if
 
02:09:02.810 --> 02:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
someone misses an appointment you want
 
02:09:04.490 --> 02:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
to charge them for it if they have no
 
02:09:07.129 --> 02:09:07.139 align:start position:0%
money to to begin with it's
 
02:09:09.050 --> 02:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
it's a difficult thing so it's really
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:16.850 --> 02:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
and we're having a lot of good talk but
 
02:09:19.250 --> 02:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
I wonder if our hands are going to be
 
02:09:21.410 --> 02:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
forced on us a little bit because of the
 
02:09:23.689 --> 02:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
federal court order talking about the
 
02:09:26.510 --> 02:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
warehousing in the ER and the fixing it
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
I emailed it to to folks this morning I
 
02:09:31.550 --> 02:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
I we haven't gotten an assessment of
 
02:09:34.010 --> 02:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
what that Federal order is going to mean
 
02:09:36.770 --> 02:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
but I I just in the back of my mind I'm
 
02:09:39.169 --> 02:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
wondering if uh some of these decisions
 
02:09:41.330 --> 02:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
might be forced upon US Representative
 
02:09:44.169 --> 02:09:44.179 align:start position:0%
Irfan representative walner
 
02:09:46.729 --> 02:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
represent Wallner
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I just wondered if we're going to
 
02:09:51.290 --> 02:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
have a chance to uh hear from some of
 
02:09:53.450 --> 02:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
the providers about
 
02:09:55.250 --> 02:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
the rate situation
 
02:09:58.189 --> 02:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
I think there are some actually here yes
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
I I had I had tried to get to this part
 
02:10:02.709 --> 02:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
of the conversation earlier this morning
 
02:10:06.530 --> 02:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
so so that there would be time uh and
 
02:10:08.330 --> 02:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
where we're at is
 
02:10:11.750 --> 02:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
um we we need to take a break uh we're
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
going to come back at one o'clock uh for
 
02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
HB uh 527 that is actually going to be I
 
02:10:21.850 --> 02:10:21.860 align:start position:0%
think an ongoing discussion about
 
02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
targeting rates overall with the 527
 
02:10:28.010 --> 02:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
issue considered specifically and then
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
we have at least one or two groups that
 
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak to us uh could you raise
 
02:10:36.109 --> 02:10:36.119 align:start position:0%
your hand if you think you want to speak
 
02:10:39.669 --> 02:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
to us okay now now now let's do it again
 
02:10:42.770 --> 02:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
but only one group if you're in a group
 
02:10:46.129 --> 02:10:46.139 align:start position:0%
just one hand goes up per group one two
 
02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
three I see three groups want to talk to
 
02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:50.629 align:start position:0%
three I see three groups want to talk to
us

02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:10:54.890 --> 02:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
is there there's not a fourth okay so
 
02:10:54.900 --> 02:10:56.330 align:start position:0%
is there there's not a fourth okay so
um

02:10:56.330 --> 02:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:58.970 --> 02:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
can any of you do it in three minutes or
 
02:10:58.980 --> 02:10:59.930 align:start position:0%
can any of you do it in three minutes or
less

02:10:59.930 --> 02:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
less
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay I got one person who can do it in
 
02:11:04.729 --> 02:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
three minutes or less come on come on up

thank you Mr chairman uh for the record
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
my name is Brendan Williams I'm the
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
president CEO of the New Hampshire
 
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Association we represent a
 
02:11:58.669 --> 02:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities throughout the
 
02:12:01.370 --> 02:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
state Assisted Living uh to some extent
 
02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
but predominantly nursing homes as well
 
02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
as the Cedar Crest Center for children
 
02:12:08.830 --> 02:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
with disabilities uh I'm giving you
 
02:12:12.169 --> 02:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
handouts that sort of illustrate where
 
02:12:14.930 --> 02:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
we're at right now uh obviously the
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic has hit the nursing home sector
 
02:12:20.810 --> 02:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
uh particularly hard we've seen sort of
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
what we call the the great resignation
 
02:12:25.850 --> 02:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
in terms of the workforce realignment
 
02:12:27.890 --> 02:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
that has occurred and that's a
 
02:12:30.050 --> 02:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
realignment that's affected all health
 
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
care providers in our state but if it
 
02:12:34.189 --> 02:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
has been particularly impactful to
 
02:12:37.189 --> 02:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
nursing homes we currently have the
 
02:12:40.609 --> 02:12:40.619 align:start position:0%
nation's fourth worst Staffing shortage
 
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
for nursing home care and the
 
02:12:45.229 --> 02:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
consequence of that is that facilities
 
02:12:46.910 --> 02:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
are turning away people who might
 
02:12:49.310 --> 02:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise so for example be discharged
 
02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
from hospitals
 
02:12:53.589 --> 02:12:53.599 align:start position:0%
as of today the Hillsborough County
 
02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
Nursing Home has a wait list of 138
 
02:13:00.050 --> 02:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
prospective residents that's a story
 
02:13:02.689 --> 02:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
we're seeing throughout the state where
 
02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
we have beds units and wings that are
 
02:13:08.510 --> 02:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
offline and unavailable for use because
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
responsible facilities will not admit
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
residents where they're not able to
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
provide quality Care in looking at the
 
02:13:18.649 --> 02:13:18.659 align:start position:0%
examples of some other states which I
 
02:13:21.530 --> 02:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
provide to you there have been
 
02:13:24.410 --> 02:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
significant rate increases it's been a
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
bipartisan issue Republican legislatures
 
02:13:29.629 --> 02:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
throughout the country have bestowed
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
rate increases of as high as 23 percent
 
02:13:34.970 --> 02:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
in the last year
 
02:13:37.069 --> 02:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
we think that something substantial is
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
going to be required here in New
 
02:13:40.189 --> 02:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a rate increase on the order
 
02:13:43.550 --> 02:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
of 15 percent because we cannot continue
 
02:13:46.450 --> 02:13:46.460 align:start position:0%
to utilize staffing agencies
 
02:13:49.550 --> 02:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
at an extraordinary cost in order to
 
02:13:52.490 --> 02:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
Simply provide care to our existing
 
02:13:56.030 --> 02:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
residents I include for you an invoice
 
02:13:59.330 --> 02:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
from a small Catholic non-profit
 
02:14:01.729 --> 02:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
facility member of ours that serves just
 
02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
nuns 95 percent Medicaid occupancy and
 
02:14:08.830 --> 02:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
when they're paying 43 dollars an hour
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
for the services of a licensed nursing
 
02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
assistant to a staffing agency when the
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County nursing home is
 
02:14:19.370 --> 02:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
paying over 70 dollars an hour in some
 
02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:20.629 align:start position:0%
paying over 70 dollars an hour in some
instances

02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
instances
 
02:14:23.209 --> 02:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
for the services of an LNA when
 
02:14:25.729 --> 02:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County Nursing Home Mr
 
02:14:29.810 --> 02:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
chairman in your county is offering 17
 
02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
an hour no less for an LNA an eight
 
02:14:34.729 --> 02:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar signing bonuses and is
 
02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
still overrun with staffing agency
 
02:14:41.089 --> 02:14:41.099 align:start position:0%
utilization we need the resources to be
 
02:14:43.490 --> 02:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
able to invest in our Workforce and I
 
02:14:45.709 --> 02:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
think those resources exist within our
 
02:14:48.410 --> 02:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
state budget and so we will look forward
 
02:14:50.930 --> 02:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
to having an ongoing dialogue with this
 
02:14:52.850 --> 02:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
committee and very much appreciate your
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
time so Mr Williams will you take a
 
02:14:58.370 --> 02:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
question I will certainly all right so I
 
02:15:02.689 --> 02:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
I you don't know how strongly I am glad
 
02:15:05.149 --> 02:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
that you've come forward I've looked at
 
02:15:08.030 --> 02:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
your four documents quickly I I don't
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
see one of them that says what you're
 
02:15:12.589 --> 02:15:12.599 align:start position:0%
asking for though I I've heard you say
 
02:15:15.649 --> 02:15:15.659 align:start position:0%
you you want 15 percent more but I'm not
 
02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
seeing a specific rate increase document
 
02:15:21.649 --> 02:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
and I can provide that to you Mr
 
02:15:23.810 --> 02:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
chairman the state cost would be on the
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
order of 35 million dollars over two
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
years obviously matched by the federal
 
02:15:30.109 --> 02:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
government I think it would be best to
 
02:15:32.089 --> 02:15:32.099 align:start position:0%
do it up front I know that what the
 
02:15:33.709 --> 02:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
governor had proposed is to spread it
 
02:15:35.149 --> 02:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
out over two years I know that that's
 
02:15:36.649 --> 02:15:36.659 align:start position:0%
been the custom with legislative
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
Appropriations but the need is immediate
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
right now facilities I don't know how
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
facilities are going to survive until
 
02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
July 1st quite apart from after July 1st
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
if the rate increase is inadequate so I
 
02:15:51.530 --> 02:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
can certainly get you some more
 
02:15:53.390 --> 02:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
granularity when it comes to details you
 
02:15:55.850 --> 02:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
want Mr chairman I I appreciate that I
 
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
think the granularity will help we don't
 
02:16:00.290 --> 02:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of time for us to
 
02:16:02.450 --> 02:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
talk about it and so the closest we can
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
get to something that'll look like a
 
02:16:07.850 --> 02:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
snapshot of the answer the the better
 
02:16:10.129 --> 02:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
you know very happy to provide that to
 
02:16:12.410 --> 02:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman questions questions
 
02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:15.649 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman questions questions
representative

02:16:15.649 --> 02:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:17.689 --> 02:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our questions
 
02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
so can you explain
 
02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:21.649 align:start position:0%
so can you explain
how

02:16:21.649 --> 02:16:21.659 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
increasing rates is going to increase
 
02:16:27.530 --> 02:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:29.330 align:start position:0%
the number of
nurses

02:16:29.330 --> 02:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
02:16:32.089 --> 02:16:32.099 align:start position:0%
well we have some structural problems in
 
02:16:34.730 --> 02:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
our state that are sort of Beyond three
 
02:16:36.169 --> 02:16:36.179 align:start position:0%
minutes that I'm allocated here
 
02:16:39.469 --> 02:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
obviously housing is a huge issue and uh
 
02:16:41.150 --> 02:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
you know commendably this legislature
 
02:16:42.889 --> 02:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
and the governor of invested resources
 
02:16:42.899 --> 02:16:43.910 align:start position:0%
and the governor of invested resources
there

02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
to to conjure up a Workforce through
 
02:16:48.410 --> 02:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate increases when that
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
Workforce doesn't presently exist I
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
think to whatever degree we can reward
 
02:16:55.610 --> 02:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
our existing workers more uh that that's
 
02:16:57.650 --> 02:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
going to be able to stabilize the
 
02:16:59.570 --> 02:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
workforce and hopefully draw more people
 
02:17:01.490 --> 02:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
into the workforce
 
02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
so I understand that argument but it
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
seems right now that things are so out
 
02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
of balance that all is going to happen
 
02:17:09.530 --> 02:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
is the agencies will just increase what
 
02:17:11.450 --> 02:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
they're going to pay to the nurses and
 
02:17:12.889 --> 02:17:12.899 align:start position:0%
you're going to have this
 
02:17:15.290 --> 02:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
problem that just it gets worse and
 
02:17:16.490 --> 02:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
worse as opposed to getting better as
 
02:17:17.870 --> 02:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
you're proposing
 
02:17:19.490 --> 02:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about that uh
 
02:17:21.650 --> 02:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative but I have seen an
 
02:17:24.290 --> 02:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
examples of some other states decreasing
 
02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
agency utilization if we look at
 
02:17:28.730 --> 02:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for example our staffing
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
shortage is about six times worse than
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
theirs because they have put significant
 
02:17:35.690 --> 02:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
resources into stabilizing the nursing
 
02:17:37.969 --> 02:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
home Workforce so I'm confident that
 
02:17:39.650 --> 02:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
based on the examples of other states
 
02:17:41.929 --> 02:17:41.939 align:start position:0%
including those in New England that we
 
02:17:46.009 --> 02:17:46.019 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
this is great a little more than three
 
02:17:49.790 --> 02:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
minutes but representative norgren do
 
02:17:51.169 --> 02:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
you have
 
02:17:54.049 --> 02:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
uh just just a question and a comment I
 
02:17:54.059 --> 02:17:54.770 align:start position:0%
uh just just a question and a comment I
think

02:17:54.770 --> 02:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:17:59.450 --> 02:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
the hospitals are seeing similar issues
 
02:18:02.330 --> 02:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
um and and I think the combination of
 
02:18:05.330 --> 02:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and nurses retiring early
 
02:18:09.950 --> 02:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
just because they want to get out
 
02:18:11.929 --> 02:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
um it's probably impacted you the same
 
02:18:15.889 --> 02:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
as the hospitals around the state it has
 
02:18:17.570 --> 02:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative norgren and we are
 
02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
working in concert with the hospitals
 
02:18:22.549 --> 02:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
and also uh Home Care Advocates to try
 
02:18:24.650 --> 02:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
to look at this situation holistically
 
02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
because it is an interdependent system
 
02:18:31.250 --> 02:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
and you're absolutely right about that
 
02:18:33.549 --> 02:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions
 
02:18:37.490 --> 02:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative Waller Stringham anyone
 
02:18:39.709 --> 02:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
okay Mooney
 
02:18:42.290 --> 02:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
Weiler okay so
 
02:18:45.530 --> 02:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
um I have about 12 18 do you have any
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
final words of wisdom for us Mr Williams
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
no thank you Mr chairman all right uh
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to put us into
 
02:18:55.370 --> 02:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
recess at one o'clock and we'll come
 
02:18:59.209 --> 02:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
back and uh we'll talk about HP 527 but
 
02:19:01.310 --> 02:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
we'll continue very much along this very
 
02:19:04.370 --> 02:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
same Dynamic all right thank you
 
02:19:04.380 --> 02:20:21.110 align:start position:0%
same Dynamic all right thank you
foreign

02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:21.120 --> 02:20:23.450 align:start position:0%
 
because

02:20:23.450 --> 02:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:24:41.929 --> 02:24:41.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:45.889 --> 03:04:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:48.410 --> 03:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
okay so let's open this version
 
03:04:53.330 --> 03:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
okay it's um past one o'clock uh we're
 
03:04:55.910 --> 03:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
gonna come out of recess
 
03:05:00.349 --> 03:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
um on division three but uh we're going
 
03:05:01.849 --> 03:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
to open
 
03:05:10.250 --> 03:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:12.469 --> 03:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
if you are here
 
03:05:16.490 --> 03:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
specifically to talk about 527
 
03:05:19.130 --> 03:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
raise your hand please
 
03:05:22.250 --> 03:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
okay are you are you two one group or
 
03:05:24.830 --> 03:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
are you like two people
 
03:05:26.690 --> 03:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
okay is there another group other than
 
03:05:28.429 --> 03:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
you two that want to talk specifically
 
03:05:31.130 --> 03:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
on 527
 
03:05:36.950 --> 03:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:36.960 --> 03:05:40.010 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:05:40.010 --> 03:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:42.830 --> 03:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
okay so what my intent here
 
03:05:44.570 --> 03:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
is because you're here specifically to
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
talk about 527 is to hear you two
 
03:05:50.389 --> 03:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
I'd like to keep it short because I want
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
to go back into the broader context of
 
03:05:54.530 --> 03:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
the discussion we were having this
 
03:05:57.849 --> 03:05:57.859 align:start position:0%
morning about you know we have endless
 
03:06:00.950 --> 03:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
requirements for additional money and
 
03:06:02.809 --> 03:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
limited resources and we're trying to
 
03:06:04.730 --> 03:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
figure out how to how to balance it all
 
03:06:12.170 --> 03:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:12.180 --> 03:06:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:06:14.750 --> 03:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:06:17.030 --> 03:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I thought you were like
 
03:06:20.269 --> 03:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:20.279 --> 03:06:21.650 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:06:21.650 --> 03:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:06:25.370 --> 03:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
okay uh let's have you stand by then
 
03:06:27.830 --> 03:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
03:06:32.929 --> 03:06:32.939 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm gonna recess uh HP 527
 
03:06:35.330 --> 03:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
um and we'll we'll reconvene it later
 
03:06:35.340 --> 03:06:37.130 align:start position:0%
um and we'll we'll reconvene it later
today

03:06:37.130 --> 03:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:06:39.170 --> 03:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
or am I supposed to say a time later
 
03:06:43.610 --> 03:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
today all right so when we last were
 
03:06:47.170 --> 03:06:47.180 align:start position:0%
here we I think we're ready for Gina
 
03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
Haskin Haskins
 
03:06:54.070 --> 03:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:57.530 --> 03:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
come on up we can pull up another chair
 
03:07:00.050 --> 03:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
hold on a second represent I'm sorry I'm
 
03:07:01.550 --> 03:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
just a little confused as to what just
 
03:07:02.990 --> 03:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
happened we're not going to be working
 
03:07:06.530 --> 03:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
on 527 right now not for now okay and we
 
03:07:07.790 --> 03:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
are going to go back to the conversation
 
03:07:10.490 --> 03:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
we had prior to lunch right gotcha thank
 
03:07:13.610 --> 03:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
you right right and so so I'm pursuing
 
03:07:15.830 --> 03:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
the general strategy of trying to
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
understand overall all of the demands
 
03:07:21.349 --> 03:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
for money because one of the things that
 
03:07:24.050 --> 03:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
has happened to us over the years is
 
03:07:26.269 --> 03:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
that we have individual interest groups
 
03:07:30.110 --> 03:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
come to us making an excellent case that
 
03:07:32.090 --> 03:07:32.100 align:start position:0%
they need more money so we've slapped
 
03:07:34.670 --> 03:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
Band-Aids on a lot of things and I think
 
03:07:36.250 --> 03:07:36.260 align:start position:0%
over time
 
03:07:38.809 --> 03:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
we may have a requirement to figure out
 
03:07:41.389 --> 03:07:41.399 align:start position:0%
how to clean it all out and sort of a
 
03:07:43.849 --> 03:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
system review sort of way so I want to
 
03:07:46.130 --> 03:07:46.140 align:start position:0%
come back to 527 but I'd still like to
 
03:07:48.349 --> 03:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
set the context
 
03:07:55.250 --> 03:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:56.450 --> 03:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
a presentation
 
03:07:58.910 --> 03:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
of information we received before lunch
 
03:08:01.210 --> 03:08:01.220 align:start position:0%
and I think what we're going to hear now
 
03:08:05.090 --> 03:08:05.100 align:start position:0%
this is Medicaid funded
 
03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
but it is not in
 
03:08:10.429 --> 03:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid budget it's in the adult
 
03:08:12.830 --> 03:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
and elderly section so I would like
 
03:08:15.650 --> 03:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
someone to direct us to those correct
 
03:08:15.660 --> 03:08:16.730 align:start position:0%
someone to direct us to those correct
pages

03:08:16.730 --> 03:08:16.740 align:start position:0%
pages
 
03:08:19.550 --> 03:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
in the budget okay so so can you do that
 
03:08:21.710 --> 03:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
Gina or should we ask Mr White to stick
 
03:08:36.130 --> 03:08:36.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:38.870 --> 03:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
my name is Gina balkus and I'm the CEO
 
03:08:40.730 --> 03:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
at the Home Care hospice and palliative
 
03:08:42.969 --> 03:08:42.979 align:start position:0%
care Alliance of New Hampshire and our
 
03:08:45.170 --> 03:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
advocacy affiliate the granite state
 
03:08:47.330 --> 03:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
home health and hospice Association and
 
03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
I just like to ask my colleagues to
 
03:08:50.929 --> 03:08:50.939 align:start position:0%
introduce themselves
 
03:08:54.469 --> 03:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
I'm Kathy slack from Bayada Home Health
 
03:08:56.330 --> 03:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
I'm Amy Moore from Essentia Care
 
03:08:56.340 --> 03:08:57.410 align:start position:0%
I'm Amy Moore from Essentia Care
Alliance

03:08:57.410 --> 03:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
Alliance
 
03:08:59.809 --> 03:08:59.819 align:start position:0%
and we're going to talk today about two
 
03:09:02.750 --> 03:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
programs one that's in elderly and Adult
 
03:09:06.889 --> 03:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
Services on page 934 of the budget which
 
03:09:09.050 --> 03:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
is also where you're funding for
 
03:09:11.630 --> 03:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
residential care facilities Falls so I
 
03:09:13.269 --> 03:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
think that's the connection
 
03:09:15.410 --> 03:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
and then we're also going to talk about
 
03:09:18.730 --> 03:09:18.740 align:start position:0%
Medicaid private duty nursing services
 
03:09:23.030 --> 03:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:25.610 --> 03:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
a presentation for you for your
 
03:09:27.769 --> 03:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
reference and all I have um
 
03:09:29.570 --> 03:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
eight slides that I'll go through really
 
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
quickly can answer questions when you
 
03:09:34.670 --> 03:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
give us a page number is that a PDF page
 
03:09:36.710 --> 03:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
number or the actual page number it's
 
03:09:40.190 --> 03:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
the slide of the page on the oh wait uh
 
03:09:43.450 --> 03:09:43.460 align:start position:0%
the PDF you talk about the budget
 
03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
she said 9 34 and I think I'm seeing
 
03:09:48.650 --> 03:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
where it says grants for Social Services
 
03:09:51.110 --> 03:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
Program No it should be nursing services
 
03:09:58.870 --> 03:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:01.809 --> 03:10:01.819 align:start position:0%
yes that's the page
 
03:10:07.429 --> 03:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:09.769 --> 03:10:09.779 align:start position:0%
uh some of it is yes some of it is
 
03:10:09.779 --> 03:10:10.670 align:start position:0%
uh some of it is yes some of it is
County

03:10:10.670 --> 03:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
County
 
03:10:13.130 --> 03:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
yes a lot of it is County
 
03:10:15.290 --> 03:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
so I'll start out with the presentation
 
03:10:18.290 --> 03:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
that was handed out to you uh on page
 
03:10:20.750 --> 03:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
two after the title so the choices for
 
03:10:22.190 --> 03:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
Independence program for those of you
 
03:10:24.650 --> 03:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
who I know many of you are aware of it
 
03:10:26.330 --> 03:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
but I'm gonna just explain it really
 
03:10:28.849 --> 03:10:28.859 align:start position:0%
quickly this is a Medicaid waiver
 
03:10:31.550 --> 03:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
program for people who are low income
 
03:10:34.190 --> 03:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
and eligible to be in a nursing home
 
03:10:36.349 --> 03:10:36.359 align:start position:0%
but they live at home and they get
 
03:10:38.510 --> 03:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
long-term services and support
 
03:10:41.570 --> 03:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
the services are provided by a range of
 
03:10:44.150 --> 03:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
providers from small privately owned
 
03:10:46.190 --> 03:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
home care agencies to large social
 
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
service agencies like accentria that Amy
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
runs to traditional visiting nurses
 
03:10:55.910 --> 03:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
associations to large
 
03:10:59.269 --> 03:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
local offices of national companies and
 
03:11:01.610 --> 03:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
the issue that we have and this gets
 
03:11:03.590 --> 03:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
directly to the issue of reimbursement
 
03:11:05.030 --> 03:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
rates from the Department of Health and
 
03:11:07.250 --> 03:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
Human Services is that the rates do not
 
03:11:09.469 --> 03:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
allow the agencies to pay competitive
 
03:11:12.530 --> 03:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
wages and recruit and retain workers
 
03:11:15.889 --> 03:11:15.899 align:start position:0%
and that is impacting access to care we
 
03:11:18.190 --> 03:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
simply cannot provide enough Services
 
03:11:21.170 --> 03:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
based on the for what the people need
 
03:11:23.870 --> 03:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
and I I've been
 
03:11:25.910 --> 03:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
um lobbying for 35 years on Healthcare
 
03:11:28.730 --> 03:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
issues and 12 now on home care and I
 
03:11:30.769 --> 03:11:30.779 align:start position:0%
don't think I've ever seen it this bad
 
03:11:33.290 --> 03:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
as bad as it is now
 
03:11:37.010 --> 03:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
so the the the danger really is that
 
03:11:39.769 --> 03:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
agencies like accentria and Waypoint and
 
03:11:43.250 --> 03:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
others are in danger of having to give
 
03:11:45.530 --> 03:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
up CFI to just stop serving agent
 
03:11:47.630 --> 03:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
patients because we can't deliver the
 
03:11:51.170 --> 03:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
services so we'd like the the rates to
 
03:11:53.690 --> 03:11:53.700 align:start position:0%
be to go to a specific level it's not a
 
03:11:56.450 --> 03:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
percentage it's a level based on a rate
 
03:11:59.389 --> 03:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
analysis that we've done internally much
 
03:12:02.809 --> 03:12:02.819 align:start position:0%
like Mr Lipman has done on his end and
 
03:12:04.849 --> 03:12:04.859 align:start position:0%
that is to make it comparable to New
 
03:12:07.309 --> 03:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's title 3B and 20 program and
 
03:12:09.230 --> 03:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
the median private Market rates and
 
03:12:11.450 --> 03:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
average or a percentage of Medicare
 
03:12:14.090 --> 03:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
costs so before I go on just real
 
03:12:19.370 --> 03:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
quickly the before you go on I I want I
 
03:12:21.769 --> 03:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that our newest
 
03:12:23.870 --> 03:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
members the division three are in tune
 
03:12:26.030 --> 03:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
with what we're talking about okay
 
03:12:27.490 --> 03:12:27.500 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:12:31.750 --> 03:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
choices for Independence program is was
 
03:12:35.570 --> 03:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
initially set up as I understand it back
 
03:12:37.610 --> 03:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
in the days when we decided that we
 
03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to put into place a bed
 
03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
moratorium in our Nursing Home Centers
 
03:12:46.790 --> 03:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
and that because we imposed a limit in
 
03:12:48.830 --> 03:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
our Nursing Home Centers we needed other
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
options to keep people who might
 
03:12:54.349 --> 03:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise want to go to a nursing home
 
03:12:56.450 --> 03:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
but would have preferred to stay home
 
03:13:00.530 --> 03:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
anyways so this is a program that helps
 
03:13:02.929 --> 03:13:02.939 align:start position:0%
the state keep the population of the
 
03:13:05.990 --> 03:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
nursing homes down while doing a great
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
service to the the clients themselves
 
03:13:11.330 --> 03:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
because most people would prefer to stay
 
03:13:14.690 --> 03:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
at home anyways but so so that's really
 
03:13:18.050 --> 03:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
when the CFI program took off and became
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
a fundamental component of our long-term
 
03:13:24.950 --> 03:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
nursing strategy is that right I'm not
 
03:13:27.769 --> 03:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
sure of the timing but I do but your
 
03:13:30.290 --> 03:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
explanation of that CFI is for people
 
03:13:35.030 --> 03:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
who who prefer to be at home is and that
 
03:13:39.110 --> 03:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
it does it does work it coexists with
 
03:13:41.389 --> 03:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
nursing home and residential care it's
 
03:13:44.570 --> 03:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
it's a coexisting service and that if
 
03:13:47.389 --> 03:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
we're cold-blooded money people we would
 
03:13:51.050 --> 03:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
look at CFI as a grossly or not grossly
 
03:13:55.010 --> 03:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
but a significantly reduced cost to the
 
03:13:57.590 --> 03:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayer it may be on the order of an
 
03:13:59.750 --> 03:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
eighth of the cost I have some of that
 
03:14:02.090 --> 03:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
in this slide yes absolutely it's the
 
03:14:04.849 --> 03:14:04.859 align:start position:0%
lowest cost option I believe so this is
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
a smart program that people want that
 
03:14:09.410 --> 03:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
does the state some good and the
 
03:14:11.450 --> 03:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
taxpayers benefit you're doing my
 
03:14:13.910 --> 03:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
presentation for me I I just I'm just
 
03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
trying I'm just trying to make sure I
 
03:14:18.650 --> 03:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
got it you've got it all right so one of
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
the issues um and on PA the next slide
 
03:14:23.750 --> 03:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
what you'll see is that this is a slide
 
03:14:25.490 --> 03:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire fiscal policy
 
03:14:28.429 --> 03:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
Institute report that they did this
 
03:14:30.349 --> 03:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
summer and I would encourage you to go
 
03:14:33.170 --> 03:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
on to nhfpi.org and read this report
 
03:14:36.110 --> 03:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
it's excellent but this is just a really
 
03:14:37.849 --> 03:14:37.859 align:start position:0%
telling slide
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
part of the problem that that why you
 
03:14:43.070 --> 03:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
have providers like me coming forward
 
03:14:46.490 --> 03:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
and asking for money for specific
 
03:14:48.889 --> 03:14:48.899 align:start position:0%
Services is because the CFI program has
 
03:14:52.250 --> 03:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
been underfunded for years and
 
03:14:55.370 --> 03:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
what you see here is a chart that shows
 
03:14:59.510 --> 03:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
that starting in 2011 if the state had
 
03:15:04.730 --> 03:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
had just every year increased the amount
 
03:15:08.030 --> 03:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
of money in the funds for the choices
 
03:15:09.769 --> 03:15:09.779 align:start position:0%
for Independence program
 
03:15:13.730 --> 03:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
by the Medicare Market Basket home Home
 
03:15:15.769 --> 03:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
Health Market Basket index which is
 
03:15:18.070 --> 03:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
basically a federally
 
03:15:20.750 --> 03:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
determined inflation factor which
 
03:15:22.550 --> 03:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
averages about two and a half percent a
 
03:15:22.560 --> 03:15:23.630 align:start position:0%
averages about two and a half percent a
year

03:15:23.630 --> 03:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:15:23.640 --> 03:15:24.410 align:start position:0%
year
um

03:15:24.410 --> 03:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:27.650 --> 03:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
if the state had had done that starting
 
03:15:31.010 --> 03:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
in 2011 it would be the funding in the
 
03:15:33.230 --> 03:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
program would be at the blue line but
 
03:15:35.870 --> 03:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
instead it's at the green line so what
 
03:15:37.969 --> 03:15:37.979 align:start position:0%
you have is a structural deficit within
 
03:15:40.550 --> 03:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
the choices for Independence program and
 
03:15:43.010 --> 03:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
so choices for Independence is larger
 
03:15:45.650 --> 03:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
than just home care services as I
 
03:15:46.670 --> 03:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned as you'll hear later
 
03:15:48.590 --> 03:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
residential care facilities are part of
 
03:15:50.510 --> 03:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
the choices for Independence program but
 
03:15:53.990 --> 03:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
Meals on Wheels Adult Day programs those
 
03:15:56.150 --> 03:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
are all part of CFI I'm here today to
 
03:15:58.309 --> 03:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
talk about the home home based Home
 
03:16:00.530 --> 03:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
Health based program any questions so
 
03:16:00.540 --> 03:16:02.090 align:start position:0%
Health based program any questions so
far

03:16:02.090 --> 03:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
far
 
03:16:02.100 --> 03:16:06.349 align:start position:0%
far
foreign

03:16:06.349 --> 03:16:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:09.230 --> 03:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
the next slide what we have here is
 
03:16:13.130 --> 03:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
these are the um four services that are
 
03:16:15.889 --> 03:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
provided Within by Home Health agencies
 
03:16:18.469 --> 03:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
the first one is Homemakers and I've
 
03:16:20.450 --> 03:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
showed you the current rate these are
 
03:16:22.550 --> 03:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
people who will come in to the home and
 
03:16:22.560 --> 03:16:23.590 align:start position:0%
people who will come in to the home and
do

03:16:23.590 --> 03:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:16:26.690 --> 03:16:26.700 align:start position:0%
housekeeping change sheets do grocery
 
03:16:28.790 --> 03:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
shopping prepare some meals in advance
 
03:16:30.950 --> 03:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
maybe do the grocery shopping for the
 
03:16:32.809 --> 03:16:32.819 align:start position:0%
client and
 
03:16:36.410 --> 03:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
um the the state pays that um the
 
03:16:40.429 --> 03:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
agencies in 15-minute increments and for
 
03:16:42.110 --> 03:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
Homemakers it's five dollars and forty
 
03:16:44.570 --> 03:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
cents per unit
 
03:16:46.670 --> 03:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
um I might I'm going to ask I'm going to
 
03:16:48.290 --> 03:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
ask you a time out here because because
 
03:16:50.750 --> 03:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
basically we can read this okay and I
 
03:16:54.410 --> 03:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
want to I want to map this slide to the
 
03:16:59.809 --> 03:16:59.819 align:start position:0%
budget so exactly which line number okay
 
03:17:02.330 --> 03:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
would this go to if we were to agree
 
03:17:06.710 --> 03:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:10.130 --> 03:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
to line 506.
 
03:17:13.190 --> 03:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
so that's called home support waiver
 
03:17:18.830 --> 03:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
services on page 934 yes line 506 and
 
03:17:21.290 --> 03:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
all the others would go online just to
 
03:17:23.870 --> 03:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm still tracking yep then FY
 
03:17:26.889 --> 03:17:26.899 align:start position:0%
22 that was listed at
 
03:17:30.410 --> 03:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
63.344 million dollars is are we on the
 
03:17:32.690 --> 03:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
same line so I don't have that page
 
03:17:36.830 --> 03:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
anymore but it sounds about Mr White
 
03:17:38.690 --> 03:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
I'm just I just want to make sure that
 
03:17:41.150 --> 03:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
we're all talking the same thing
 
03:17:44.690 --> 03:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
and I want to point out that line 506 I
 
03:17:46.969 --> 03:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
call that the CFI kitchen sink line
 
03:17:50.210 --> 03:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
kitchen sink line because it's got it
 
03:17:52.490 --> 03:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
has personal care services in it which
 
03:17:54.950 --> 03:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
is the bulk of it but that's also
 
03:17:58.330 --> 03:17:58.340 align:start position:0%
includes Meals on Wheels Adult Day Care
 
03:18:02.150 --> 03:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
Emergency responder programs uh you know
 
03:18:04.610 --> 03:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
ramps and accommodations in homes so
 
03:18:07.790 --> 03:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
this line and the governor's budget
 
03:18:09.910 --> 03:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about the same line
 
03:18:14.090 --> 03:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
goes from 22 where it was 63.3 Million
 
03:18:18.650 --> 03:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
to 92.6 million so the governor's budget
 
03:18:21.950 --> 03:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
appears to be adding nearly 30 million
 
03:18:25.870 --> 03:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
dollars approximately you know 28 29
 
03:18:29.389 --> 03:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
above the 22 level well but if you look
 
03:18:34.490 --> 03:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
at lines 529 and 505 the the governor's
 
03:18:37.730 --> 03:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
budget zeros out those lines
 
03:18:41.330 --> 03:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
and in I believe from what I've been
 
03:18:46.250 --> 03:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
told combines it all into line 506.
 
03:18:48.650 --> 03:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
and my understanding from talking with
 
03:18:50.030 --> 03:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
Folks at the department is the reason
 
03:18:51.889 --> 03:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
they have done that is because when the
 
03:18:53.510 --> 03:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
department needs to transfer funds
 
03:18:55.130 --> 03:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
between these lines they have to go to
 
03:18:57.950 --> 03:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal and it's an administrative burden
 
03:19:00.050 --> 03:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
for them to do that I will tell you that
 
03:19:03.290 --> 03:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
fiscal Community I will tell you that
 
03:19:03.300 --> 03:19:04.070 align:start position:0%
fiscal Community I will tell you that
um

03:19:04.070 --> 03:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:07.790 --> 03:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
that 529 was added in at the request of
 
03:19:10.849 --> 03:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
my Association back in 1997. so we took
 
03:19:14.330 --> 03:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
that 19 million or so we took 21 million
 
03:19:16.790 --> 03:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
and collapsed it and we're still almost
 
03:19:19.250 --> 03:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
30 million ahead so the governor's
 
03:19:21.650 --> 03:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
budget still has like a 9 million
 
03:19:21.660 --> 03:19:23.990 align:start position:0%
budget still has like a 9 million
increase

03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:19:27.050 --> 03:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
um so so that's that's still over 10
 
03:19:30.230 --> 03:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:32.630 --> 03:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
it appears to be so you would need to
 
03:19:34.730 --> 03:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
ask the department based on I believe
 
03:19:36.710 --> 03:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's part of that's their prioritized
 
03:19:39.650 --> 03:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
needs budget okay so I'm just trying to
 
03:19:41.870 --> 03:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
understand your request you got a bunch
 
03:19:46.790 --> 03:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
of 11 33 18 50 23 the governor's
 
03:19:49.250 --> 03:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
budget's already 10 at least 10 percent
 
03:19:52.269 --> 03:19:52.279 align:start position:0%
above that I think
 
03:19:54.769 --> 03:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
above the past
 
03:19:56.710 --> 03:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:20:02.630 --> 03:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
your request is a smaller ask than what
 
03:20:04.730 --> 03:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
this your page four seems to indicate it
 
03:20:08.150 --> 03:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
it may in fact be and it could be
 
03:20:10.070 --> 03:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
included in the budget except to keep in
 
03:20:12.230 --> 03:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
mind I'm only here talking about Home
 
03:20:14.570 --> 03:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
Health Services not the broader one oh
 
03:20:19.010 --> 03:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
okay not all of CFI uh I the department
 
03:20:21.230 --> 03:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
would really have to be the one okay
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
represent a whole and then represent
 
03:20:26.690 --> 03:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
Waller thank you to page four of your
 
03:20:29.210 --> 03:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
handout right at the six dollars I'm
 
03:20:30.590 --> 03:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
just looking at the Homemakers yes
 
03:20:32.870 --> 03:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
twenty four dollars that's the rate paid
 
03:20:35.450 --> 03:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
by the state to the agency
 
03:20:37.550 --> 03:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
can you help me understand how that then
 
03:20:40.070 --> 03:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
translates to roughly the hourly rate
 
03:20:41.450 --> 03:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:20:43.490 --> 03:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
the Homemaker or the person who's being
 
03:20:45.889 --> 03:20:45.899 align:start position:0%
hired is that is that a third lower
 
03:20:48.230 --> 03:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
where are we so first of all I just want
 
03:20:51.410 --> 03:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
to clarify the current rate is 21.60 per
 
03:20:53.750 --> 03:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
hour the proposed rate the proposed rate
 
03:20:55.790 --> 03:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
is 24 which would be equivalent to what
 
03:20:58.010 --> 03:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
the state pays in the title 20 and 3B
 
03:21:00.349 --> 03:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
program right I'm trying to get let's
 
03:21:02.090 --> 03:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
take the 2160. what does that translate
 
03:21:06.349 --> 03:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
into an hourly rate roughly on average I
 
03:21:08.090 --> 03:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
can speak to the like one down the
 
03:21:10.730 --> 03:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
personal care 2248 which is similar to
 
03:21:13.429 --> 03:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
Homemaker so the the issue is that
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
somebody can be approved right for X
 
03:21:17.570 --> 03:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
number of hours and that's when that
 
03:21:19.309 --> 03:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
person is in the home it doesn't cover a
 
03:21:21.410 --> 03:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
supervision workers comp training
 
03:21:23.330 --> 03:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
support payroll all of the things
 
03:21:25.130 --> 03:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
mileage that go along with that and
 
03:21:26.929 --> 03:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
that's our struggle so for like pcsps
 
03:21:28.130 --> 03:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:21:30.790 --> 03:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
um it's like 13 an hour
 
03:21:32.809 --> 03:21:32.819 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to get to right
 
03:21:36.050 --> 03:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
in in typical Consulting and temporary
 
03:21:38.690 --> 03:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
labor right it's a minimum of a 28 and
 
03:21:41.510 --> 03:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
potentially as high as a 40 right
 
03:21:44.510 --> 03:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
on top of the actual hourly rate that
 
03:21:46.429 --> 03:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
translates to the agency rate and I just
 
03:21:47.870 --> 03:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
didn't know whether you're held true or
 
03:21:49.610 --> 03:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
those numbers were out of whack because
 
03:21:52.130 --> 03:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
this is because of the shortage of
 
03:21:53.870 --> 03:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
people yeah
 
03:21:53.880 --> 03:21:54.670 align:start position:0%
people yeah
um

03:21:54.670 --> 03:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
I think that you know it I don't think
 
03:21:58.910 --> 03:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's out of whack because of the
 
03:22:00.530 --> 03:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
shortage of people as I said I've been
 
03:22:02.269 --> 03:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
here for 12 years asking for rate
 
03:22:03.830 --> 03:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
increases in these areas and the problem
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
has always been the same the
 
03:22:07.130 --> 03:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates are simply not
 
03:22:09.230 --> 03:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
enough to cover the full cost of care
 
03:22:11.630 --> 03:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
there's more pressure now though because
 
03:22:14.030 --> 03:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
while agencies like Accenture are paying
 
03:22:16.730 --> 03:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
personal care providers 13 an hour you
 
03:22:18.469 --> 03:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
know you can go work and well you said
 
03:22:20.809 --> 03:22:20.819 align:start position:0%
you had a client uh an employee that
 
03:22:23.690 --> 03:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
last week that yeah so four clients left
 
03:22:25.250 --> 03:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
to go I mean everyone's our competition
 
03:22:27.230 --> 03:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
my daughter is 15 and she makes more
 
03:22:28.670 --> 03:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
babysitting next door and she does
 
03:22:28.680 --> 03:22:29.750 align:start position:0%
babysitting next door and she does
nothing

03:22:29.750 --> 03:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
03:22:31.610 --> 03:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
um so that's really our issue is
 
03:22:33.050 --> 03:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
everyone's a competition one thing
 
03:22:34.370 --> 03:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
that's come up that I've talked about is
 
03:22:36.590 --> 03:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
that we say well well if we raise like
 
03:22:38.269 --> 03:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
right the pay are there do we have the
 
03:22:40.670 --> 03:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
workers and during the arpa stapins that
 
03:22:42.050 --> 03:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
we've been doing I've been tracking that
 
03:22:44.150 --> 03:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
data and because we're able to pay these
 
03:22:45.410 --> 03:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
stipends are a little bit more right
 
03:22:46.429 --> 03:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
we're like we're bringing them up to
 
03:22:49.130 --> 03:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
like 15 16 an hour with this
 
03:22:50.210 --> 03:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
problem is they're going to fall off
 
03:22:52.010 --> 03:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
right it's one-time funding but we've
 
03:22:53.330 --> 03:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
tracked that we've been able to deliver
 
03:22:55.610 --> 03:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
like 20 more services because they can
 
03:22:57.889 --> 03:22:57.899 align:start position:0%
actually make ends meet
 
03:23:00.110 --> 03:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
so represent Walnut do you still have a
 
03:23:00.120 --> 03:23:01.730 align:start position:0%
so represent Walnut do you still have a
question

03:23:01.730 --> 03:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:23:03.710 --> 03:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:23:03.720 --> 03:23:04.389 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

03:23:04.389 --> 03:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:06.889 --> 03:23:06.899 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
03:23:09.469 --> 03:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
um the uh it looks to me like this
 
03:23:11.150 --> 03:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
budget that's in here may take into
 
03:23:13.429 --> 03:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
account increased payment per service
 
03:23:15.769 --> 03:23:15.779 align:start position:0%
but it also may take into account
 
03:23:18.170 --> 03:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
increased number of services
 
03:23:21.170 --> 03:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
so so you could have a 10 increase all
 
03:23:23.690 --> 03:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
due to increased volume or all due to
 
03:23:25.910 --> 03:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
increased and I think that I think
 
03:23:27.469 --> 03:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
that's a really good point represents
 
03:23:28.790 --> 03:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
drink them and I think you need to talk
 
03:23:30.590 --> 03:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
with the Department about that my
 
03:23:32.269 --> 03:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the money that's
 
03:23:34.490 --> 03:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
in the budget is
 
03:23:37.990 --> 03:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
a rate increase and a caseload increase
 
03:23:41.870 --> 03:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
but I will I think it's important for
 
03:23:44.210 --> 03:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
you to look at the the Department's
 
03:23:44.220 --> 03:23:45.769 align:start position:0%
you to look at the the Department's
dashboard

03:23:45.769 --> 03:23:45.779 align:start position:0%
dashboard
 
03:23:47.750 --> 03:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
um one would expect that there would be
 
03:23:49.610 --> 03:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
a caseload increase because of the
 
03:23:51.050 --> 03:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
demographics of the State of New
 
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but when I've looked at the
 
03:23:54.650 --> 03:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
dashboard for fiscal and you look at the
 
03:23:58.429 --> 03:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
line for CFI it actually has been pretty
 
03:24:01.429 --> 03:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
stable for the past almost two years
 
03:24:03.590 --> 03:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
which is surprising
 
03:24:07.370 --> 03:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
so um there may and and this is this is
 
03:24:08.570 --> 03:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
a nuance
 
03:24:11.690 --> 03:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
if you're a new CFI client that's been
 
03:24:13.550 --> 03:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
determined to be eligible
 
03:24:16.250 --> 03:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
you're not getting any services
 
03:24:18.349 --> 03:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
there's nobody available to provide
 
03:24:20.809 --> 03:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
those services so so Mr Ripple I'm gonna
 
03:24:23.450 --> 03:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna ask her I'm going to make a
 
03:24:28.010 --> 03:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
request of you and Mr White uh I I think
 
03:24:29.750 --> 03:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
we've identified the line we're looking
 
03:24:34.130 --> 03:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
at line 506 on page 934 there's an
 
03:24:37.910 --> 03:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
increase already in FY 24
 
03:24:41.990 --> 03:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
and we don't know what supports that
 
03:24:43.790 --> 03:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
increase at this point we don't know
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
what rate Factor was used we don't know
 
03:24:48.969 --> 03:24:48.979 align:start position:0%
what utilization Factor was was
 
03:24:52.130 --> 03:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
considered and so as a result we don't
 
03:24:55.969 --> 03:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
know how to evaluate this proposal in
 
03:24:57.530 --> 03:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
front of us we don't know if this is
 
03:24:59.690 --> 03:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
already in the budget or if we need a
 
03:25:02.650 --> 03:25:02.660 align:start position:0%
little bit more or a lot more
 
03:25:05.269 --> 03:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
go ahead Mr Roy do you want to speak
 
03:25:07.790 --> 03:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
grab that microphone
 
03:25:10.250 --> 03:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
sure so on March 7th um the division
 
03:25:12.349 --> 03:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
long term supports and services we'll be
 
03:25:14.990 --> 03:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
presenting their budget to the committee
 
03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:15.670 align:start position:0%
presenting their budget to the committee
um

03:25:15.670 --> 03:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:17.929 --> 03:25:17.939 align:start position:0%
the numbers that you're seeing that are
 
03:25:19.790 --> 03:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
in front of you those are the projected
 
03:25:22.910 --> 03:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
increase utilization the the additional
 
03:25:25.309 --> 03:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
three percent that was referred to that
 
03:25:27.469 --> 03:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
will be included in an hb2 provision the
 
03:25:29.630 --> 03:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
final language which is yet available so
 
03:25:31.969 --> 03:25:31.979 align:start position:0%
when you say three percent you mean 3.1
 
03:25:34.370 --> 03:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
percent because somewhere else we you
 
03:25:36.110 --> 03:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
talked about three percent is just being
 
03:25:38.750 --> 03:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
like a supply and inflation adjustment
 
03:25:41.809 --> 03:25:41.819 align:start position:0%
yeah the the 3.1 percent correct yes
 
03:25:43.910 --> 03:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay and I need them to be called
 
03:25:45.530 --> 03:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
something different so I know which one
 
03:25:47.889 --> 03:25:47.899 align:start position:0%
we're talking about so
 
03:25:50.030 --> 03:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out that the other
 
03:25:50.040 --> 03:25:50.929 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out that the other
service

03:25:50.929 --> 03:25:50.939 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:25:53.990 --> 03:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
on this um so before you get going I'm
 
03:25:55.610 --> 03:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
going to ask representative walner to
 
03:25:57.950 --> 03:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
ask and ask her a question oh well I'm
 
03:25:59.210 --> 03:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
not gonna make a question I'm not asking
 
03:26:01.250 --> 03:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
a question I can make a statement I
 
03:26:02.690 --> 03:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
think what we have here is sort of the
 
03:26:05.690 --> 03:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
cart before the horse if because what we
 
03:26:08.750 --> 03:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
have is we have a presentation about a
 
03:26:12.250 --> 03:26:12.260 align:start position:0%
specific specific service that is
 
03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
embedded into a line that we don't have
 
03:26:17.690 --> 03:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
enough information at this point to
 
03:26:19.370 --> 03:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
really understand that line and we won't
 
03:26:22.250 --> 03:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
until March 7th is my understanding
 
03:26:24.710 --> 03:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
so so we agree that's why I asked the
 
03:26:26.510 --> 03:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
question so that when we do hear it we
 
03:26:28.610 --> 03:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
we get the context necessary to
 
03:26:30.650 --> 03:26:30.660 align:start position:0%
understand the requests yeah I think it
 
03:26:33.229 --> 03:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
would be much more helpful if we have I
 
03:26:34.429 --> 03:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
mean I
 
03:26:36.650 --> 03:26:36.660 align:start position:0%
complete this complete this one today
 
03:26:40.010 --> 03:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
but if we have further ones that really
 
03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
relate more to the March 7th information
 
03:26:45.349 --> 03:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
it seems like it would be better to have
 
03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
it at that point than to be skipping all
 
03:26:50.990 --> 03:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
around like this
 
03:26:53.809 --> 03:26:53.819 align:start position:0%
you're not wrong the good news is that
 
03:26:56.150 --> 03:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
we we now have an opportunity to have
 
03:26:58.490 --> 03:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
the department do the homework so that
 
03:27:00.889 --> 03:27:00.899 align:start position:0%
we have it on March 7th and we got to be
 
03:27:02.750 --> 03:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
done by the end of March no matter what
 
03:27:06.830 --> 03:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
the clock is ticking so uh do you I just
 
03:27:08.450 --> 03:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
want to point out that the other the
 
03:27:11.690 --> 03:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
other services on this page are in would
 
03:27:14.870 --> 03:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
normally be in class line 529 but
 
03:27:16.969 --> 03:27:16.979 align:start position:0%
they've been zeroed out and I would just
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
say for the sake of transparency we
 
03:27:20.870 --> 03:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
would prefer they stay in 529 and not be
 
03:27:24.650 --> 03:27:24.660 align:start position:0%
all combined I think that it gives
 
03:27:27.290 --> 03:27:27.300 align:start position:0%
um the public more understanding if it's
 
03:27:29.090 --> 03:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
not zeroed out
 
03:27:29.100 --> 03:27:29.690 align:start position:0%
not zeroed out
um

03:27:29.690 --> 03:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:31.550 --> 03:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's our opinion that's an
 
03:27:33.769 --> 03:27:33.779 align:start position:0%
excellent point Thank you so I just I'm
 
03:27:35.269 --> 03:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
gonna I know that you have a lot of
 
03:27:36.410 --> 03:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
other things to do I'm going to quickly
 
03:27:38.090 --> 03:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
go through the next page and you can
 
03:27:40.790 --> 03:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
read this for yourself this shows what
 
03:27:44.090 --> 03:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
what based on the the requests we've had
 
03:27:47.030 --> 03:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
which is to match the title 20 and 3B
 
03:27:49.610 --> 03:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
rates and to get closer to the median
 
03:27:51.590 --> 03:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
private pay rates
 
03:27:55.550 --> 03:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
um the current the current um value of
 
03:27:57.950 --> 03:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 22 the department
 
03:27:57.960 --> 03:27:59.530 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 22 the department
authorized

03:27:59.530 --> 03:27:59.540 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
03:28:02.630 --> 03:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
73.6 million dollars in home health
 
03:28:05.690 --> 03:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
services this was the need
 
03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
that's what they authorized for care I
 
03:28:09.950 --> 03:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
can't tell you what the budget was
 
03:28:11.929 --> 03:28:11.939 align:start position:0%
because I don't have the budget broken
 
03:28:14.150 --> 03:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
down by service line the department
 
03:28:16.309 --> 03:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
would have to share that with you all we
 
03:28:19.250 --> 03:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
can see is that big line of 66 million
 
03:28:22.670 --> 03:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
in class 506 but that has other services
 
03:28:24.170 --> 03:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
in it
 
03:28:26.990 --> 03:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
what they actually paid out was 48.9
 
03:28:29.630 --> 03:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars for you an average
 
03:28:33.710 --> 03:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
service utilization rate of 66.42 but
 
03:28:35.929 --> 03:28:35.939 align:start position:0%
for some services like personal care
 
03:28:39.229 --> 03:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's like 50 percent on
 
03:28:42.349 --> 03:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
page eight where it says private duty
 
03:28:44.450 --> 03:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
nursing would that have typically been
 
03:28:47.450 --> 03:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
line 505 no it's a different page
 
03:28:47.460 --> 03:28:48.650 align:start position:0%
line 505 no it's a different page
altogether

03:28:48.650 --> 03:28:48.660 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
03:28:50.090 --> 03:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go into different
 
03:28:51.650 --> 03:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
programs so I just want to show you that
 
03:28:53.150 --> 03:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
what we're asking for in order to
 
03:28:54.950 --> 03:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
stabilize the program and then grow the
 
03:28:56.929 --> 03:28:56.939 align:start position:0%
program is seven and a half million in
 
03:28:59.870 --> 03:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 and 9.3 million in fiscal
 
03:29:02.450 --> 03:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
year 25 in general funds so when you
 
03:29:04.849 --> 03:29:04.859 align:start position:0%
talked about with Mr lippman before
 
03:29:06.469 --> 03:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
about giving the department the
 
03:29:09.050 --> 03:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take funds and to Target
 
03:29:11.929 --> 03:29:11.939 align:start position:0%
it to the neediest areas I totally
 
03:29:13.670 --> 03:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
support that as opposed to an
 
03:29:15.530 --> 03:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
across-the-board rate increase the key
 
03:29:17.269 --> 03:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
thing is how much you give them
 
03:29:19.610 --> 03:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
how much you give them to do what they
 
03:29:21.889 --> 03:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
need to do to get to programs like this
 
03:29:24.410 --> 03:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
that need services
 
03:29:27.110 --> 03:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
um on the um and I think the next page
 
03:29:30.469 --> 03:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh representative Edwards page six you
 
03:29:30.479 --> 03:29:31.190 align:start position:0%
uh representative Edwards page six you
know

03:29:31.190 --> 03:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:29:34.190 --> 03:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
um what would it cost so it's about on
 
03:29:35.990 --> 03:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
average the annual spend for the state
 
03:29:38.269 --> 03:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
on a CFI client is about twenty thousand
 
03:29:40.729 --> 03:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
dollars for a nursing facility patient
 
03:29:43.429 --> 03:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
it's about eighty one thousand dollars
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
um if all those and there's about 3 600
 
03:29:49.790 --> 03:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
people in CFI in fiscal year 22. if you
 
03:29:51.950 --> 03:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
took those 3 600 people and put them all
 
03:29:53.809 --> 03:29:53.819 align:start position:0%
in a nursing home it would cost you 200
 
03:29:55.849 --> 03:29:55.859 align:start position:0%
200 million dollars more than you're
 
03:29:59.929 --> 03:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:03.290 --> 03:30:03.300 align:start position:0%
so next slide different program all
 
03:30:05.090 --> 03:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
together different program all together
 
03:30:07.750 --> 03:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can we skip to slide 10
 
03:30:11.990 --> 03:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
uniform home health aid rates yes is is
 
03:30:14.990 --> 03:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
that on page 934 in one of those line
 
03:30:17.210 --> 03:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
items or is that on a total Different
 
03:30:17.220 --> 03:30:18.950 align:start position:0%
items or is that on a total Different
Page

03:30:18.950 --> 03:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
Page
 
03:30:20.269 --> 03:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
so it
 
03:30:22.250 --> 03:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
part of it is and part of it isn't how's
 
03:30:23.570 --> 03:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
that for an answer
 
03:30:27.349 --> 03:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
so this compares the rates between Title
 
03:30:30.110 --> 03:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
20 and 3B which is mostly federal funds
 
03:30:34.370 --> 03:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
the CFI program which is on page 934 the
 
03:30:39.370 --> 03:30:39.380 align:start position:0%
Medicaid State plan which is on page 922
 
03:30:43.610 --> 03:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
divided among MCO and provider payments
 
03:30:47.330 --> 03:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
so it's all but this is the same service
 
03:30:49.790 --> 03:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
home health aide service in three
 
03:30:51.769 --> 03:30:51.779 align:start position:0%
different state programs and you can see
 
03:30:54.469 --> 03:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
the three different state the
 
03:30:57.170 --> 03:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
reimbursement levels and the irony is
 
03:30:59.990 --> 03:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
the one that's the most acute is the one
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
is is in the Medicaid State Plan
 
03:31:02.399 --> 03:31:03.650 align:start position:0%
is is in the Medicaid State Plan
services

03:31:03.650 --> 03:31:03.660 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:31:06.349 --> 03:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
and it gets paid the least
 
03:31:08.330 --> 03:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
they should all be brought up to six
 
03:31:11.090 --> 03:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
eight dollars per 50 minute unit or 32
 
03:31:12.650 --> 03:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
you know for a total of thirty two
 
03:31:16.010 --> 03:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:18.469 --> 03:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
so if we if we did that second column
 
03:31:22.790 --> 03:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
current CFI rate then are we on line 505
 
03:31:24.950 --> 03:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
mid-level care expenses
 
03:31:28.070 --> 03:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
no we would be online uh it would be in
 
03:31:32.389 --> 03:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
five line 529 but now it's in the the
 
03:31:35.410 --> 03:31:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
but I have included the rate increase
 
03:31:42.050 --> 03:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
for CFI in my request of 7.2 million and
 
03:31:44.389 --> 03:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
9.5 million what I haven't included is
 
03:31:46.910 --> 03:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
the request for the Medicaid State Plan
 
03:31:49.490 --> 03:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
service because I don't have the data to
 
03:31:52.010 --> 03:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
back that up okay so I'm going to invite
 
03:31:55.550 --> 03:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
you back on March 7th I I I think you've
 
03:31:57.889 --> 03:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
given us a nice presentation there's
 
03:31:59.809 --> 03:31:59.819 align:start position:0%
something for us to look at you've
 
03:32:02.929 --> 03:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
pointed at us the the budget what what
 
03:32:04.969 --> 03:32:04.979 align:start position:0%
what what 30 seconds do you have to
 
03:32:07.370 --> 03:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
close so the 36 seconds I have is on a
 
03:32:11.090 --> 03:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
program that is in line not on page 922
 
03:32:12.530 --> 03:32:12.540 align:start position:0%
which you talked about earlier today
 
03:32:15.229 --> 03:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
with Mr Lipman and he actually used this
 
03:32:18.889 --> 03:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
case as an example in in one of his uh
 
03:32:22.130 --> 03:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
targeted case uh requests
 
03:32:24.590 --> 03:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
um service requests so Medicaid private
 
03:32:27.830 --> 03:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
duty nursing is intensive care in the
 
03:32:31.309 --> 03:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
home provided only by nurses for for
 
03:32:32.809 --> 03:32:32.819 align:start position:0%
mostly children
 
03:32:36.590 --> 03:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
and some adults who are on trachs vents
 
03:32:40.370 --> 03:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
they might have ALS Kathy's they're on
 
03:32:41.809 --> 03:32:41.819 align:start position:0%
heart issues
 
03:32:45.229 --> 03:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
there's a whole host of medical issues
 
03:32:47.090 --> 03:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
that often are dealt with in the
 
03:32:49.010 --> 03:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
hospital but because they're able to be
 
03:32:50.030 --> 03:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
brought home
 
03:32:52.250 --> 03:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
same sort of savings that we would have
 
03:32:56.210 --> 03:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
for those children to be at home to meet
 
03:32:58.070 --> 03:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
their developmental stages that they
 
03:33:00.650 --> 03:33:00.660 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make at the hospital we just
 
03:33:03.229 --> 03:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
had a little girl graduate into services
 
03:33:05.210 --> 03:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
and started kindergarten without a nurse
 
03:33:07.610 --> 03:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
and that was after a couple of years of
 
03:33:11.090 --> 03:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
intense support so she was able to meet
 
03:33:14.210 --> 03:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
those milestones at home
 
03:33:16.309 --> 03:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
so you can look at this on your own on
 
03:33:18.590 --> 03:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
page eight we show you what the current
 
03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
rates are we show you what the requested
 
03:33:22.250 --> 03:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
rate increase it's a forty percent rate
 
03:33:22.260 --> 03:33:24.190 align:start position:0%
rate increase it's a forty percent rate
increase

03:33:24.190 --> 03:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:33:26.690 --> 03:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
I don't know what else to tell you this
 
03:33:28.969 --> 03:33:28.979 align:start position:0%
is what it's going to take to hire the
 
03:33:32.330 --> 03:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
nurses to get to get into these homes to
 
03:33:34.250 --> 03:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
take care of these kids and these adults
 
03:33:36.830 --> 03:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
so do the nurses exist we keep running
 
03:33:39.050 --> 03:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
into this I mean which is the chicken
 
03:33:40.849 --> 03:33:40.859 align:start position:0%
and which is the egg we've got more
 
03:33:43.910 --> 03:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
money do we have more people it's a very
 
03:33:47.330 --> 03:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
difficult measure however we we have
 
03:33:49.429 --> 03:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
maintained for about the last two years
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
we haven't grown we haven't decreased
 
03:33:54.290 --> 03:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
we've gained clients we've lost clients
 
03:33:57.410 --> 03:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
we've lost more nurses than we've lost
 
03:34:00.170 --> 03:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
clients and when we hire a new nurse in
 
03:34:02.269 --> 03:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
the expectation is that they're getting
 
03:34:04.490 --> 03:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
Mass rates and the only way to hire them
 
03:34:07.010 --> 03:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
is to hire them at more than more being
 
03:34:09.950 --> 03:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursed it's we're chasing our Tails
 
03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
trying to help these families so if we
 
03:34:13.790 --> 03:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
get more people that are likely to be
 
03:34:19.370 --> 03:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:20.690 --> 03:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
and if you
 
03:34:23.690 --> 03:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
if you have our exit interviews a lot of
 
03:34:25.130 --> 03:34:25.140 align:start position:0%
people are just going over the line into
 
03:34:27.110 --> 03:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to work okay keep them
 
03:34:30.050 --> 03:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
here right yeah I think the other thing
 
03:34:31.429 --> 03:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
you need to know and this is just the
 
03:34:33.349 --> 03:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
reality of the pandemic I mean we are
 
03:34:35.210 --> 03:34:35.220 align:start position:0%
robbing Peter to payroll Paul there's no
 
03:34:37.250 --> 03:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
there's no denying that
 
03:34:39.830 --> 03:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
um there are Hospital nurses who are
 
03:34:41.210 --> 03:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
burnt out
 
03:34:43.969 --> 03:34:43.979 align:start position:0%
they want to go somewhere else this is a
 
03:34:45.889 --> 03:34:45.899 align:start position:0%
viable option for them but they expect
 
03:34:48.769 --> 03:34:48.779 align:start position:0%
Hospital wages and Hospital benefits and
 
03:34:50.630 --> 03:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
those big bonuses all you have to do is
 
03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
go on to indeed and search for nurses
 
03:34:54.050 --> 03:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
and you'll see what nurses are getting
 
03:34:55.790 --> 03:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
paid all right thank you
 
03:34:55.800 --> 03:34:57.410 align:start position:0%
paid all right thank you
so

03:34:57.410 --> 03:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:59.990 --> 03:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I think the one thing that I would
 
03:35:02.450 --> 03:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
ask you to consider and I know you're
 
03:35:04.849 --> 03:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
the finance committee just remember the
 
03:35:06.469 --> 03:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
reason I put all these pictures in here
 
03:35:08.210 --> 03:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
too is there are real people on the
 
03:35:10.010 --> 03:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
other end there are people who are not
 
03:35:12.469 --> 03:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
getting the services they need the
 
03:35:15.469 --> 03:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
clients that Kathy's agency serves
 
03:35:18.110 --> 03:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
across the state they're getting 47
 
03:35:21.710 --> 03:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
percent of their authorized Services 47
 
03:35:24.530 --> 03:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
if they're lucky then I mentioned we
 
03:35:28.190 --> 03:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
support 35 families I have about 45 on
 
03:35:30.170 --> 03:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
the waiting list for referrals that
 
03:35:32.210 --> 03:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
aren't getting no services that we could
 
03:35:35.090 --> 03:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
serve if we had had the staff
 
03:35:38.330 --> 03:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
so so if we gave you a 15 increase you'd
 
03:35:40.969 --> 03:35:40.979 align:start position:0%
say you'd serve all the additional 45 on
 
03:35:44.750 --> 03:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:46.790 --> 03:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's why we asked for 40 percent
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to get to the
 
03:35:51.290 --> 03:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
rates that Mass health is paying and
 
03:35:53.150 --> 03:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
they're doing overtime
 
03:35:55.450 --> 03:35:55.460 align:start position:0%
student loan forgiveness
 
03:35:58.309 --> 03:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
scholarships they are throwing so much
 
03:35:59.690 --> 03:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
money into it and that's why we're
 
03:36:02.630 --> 03:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
losing nurses over the border so
 
03:36:04.610 --> 03:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
um you know I think the department has a
 
03:36:06.590 --> 03:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
really difficult challenge when you're
 
03:36:08.090 --> 03:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
going through those rates and you're
 
03:36:09.830 --> 03:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
trying to look at things and you look at
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
around the state the neighboring states
 
03:36:14.269 --> 03:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
and you look at Medicare and you look at
 
03:36:16.729 --> 03:36:16.739 align:start position:0%
the market rates you know I looked at Mr
 
03:36:19.610 --> 03:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
lipman's uh now rate setting on this one
 
03:36:21.530 --> 03:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
that's in his packet you know you look
 
03:36:23.389 --> 03:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
at Vermont they're only paying 39 an
 
03:36:25.070 --> 03:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
hour I don't want to be compared to
 
03:36:27.769 --> 03:36:27.779 align:start position:0%
Vermont I mean if if they're paying 39
 
03:36:30.050 --> 03:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
an hour that's their problem but don't
 
03:36:33.170 --> 03:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
average the rate so that it brings us
 
03:36:36.530 --> 03:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
down we need to be competitive in the
 
03:36:38.929 --> 03:36:38.939 align:start position:0%
marketplace that we're in
 
03:36:42.590 --> 03:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to saving money one
 
03:36:45.530 --> 03:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
trip to a neonatal Intensive Care Unit
 
03:36:48.830 --> 03:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
or a flight on Dart to Boston Children's
 
03:36:51.950 --> 03:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
is going to cost and then a stay of a
 
03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
week or two weeks is going to cost
 
03:36:55.790 --> 03:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars thank
 
03:36:57.349 --> 03:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you so much for your time
 
03:37:03.229 --> 03:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:06.110 --> 03:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
I think we had thank you
 
03:37:08.210 --> 03:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
another member of the public that wanted
 
03:37:30.130 --> 03:37:30.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:32.990 --> 03:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman my name is
 
03:37:36.950 --> 03:37:36.960 align:start position:0%

care provider because my home run out of
 
03:37:42.410 --> 03:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
business in May of 2022 uh and with me
 
03:37:45.710 --> 03:37:45.720 align:start position:0%

and he is the lobbyist for the New
 
03:37:49.610 --> 03:37:49.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Residential

03:37:52.380 --> 03:37:58.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:37:58.309 --> 03:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
so before you get talking and thank you
 
03:38:02.809 --> 03:38:02.819 align:start position:0%
for coming
 
03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
I I just want to make sure that we're
 
03:38:05.040 --> 03:38:06.130 align:start position:0%
I I just want to make sure that we're
tracking

03:38:06.130 --> 03:38:06.140 align:start position:0%
tracking
 
03:38:09.410 --> 03:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
which line we're going to be hearing
 
03:38:11.809 --> 03:38:11.819 align:start position:0%
about you and I believe you have a hard
 
03:38:14.870 --> 03:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
time knowing that no I'm asking if Mr
 
03:38:19.250 --> 03:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
Ripple or Mr White or Mr lippman is able
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
to direct us we're going to hear about
 
03:38:24.830 --> 03:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
CFI mid-level care assisted living is
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
that what we just did on nine page 934
 
03:38:29.690 --> 03:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
that's correct line 505.
 
03:38:31.969 --> 03:38:31.979 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
03:38:36.650 --> 03:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
so so because this is a a March 7th item
 
03:38:39.710 --> 03:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
if you could just give us the highlights
 
03:38:39.720 --> 03:38:41.330 align:start position:0%
if you could just give us the highlights
okay

03:38:41.330 --> 03:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:38:41.340 --> 03:38:42.530 align:start position:0%
okay
um

03:38:42.530 --> 03:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:44.809 --> 03:38:44.819 align:start position:0%
very briefly um you did a kind of a
 
03:38:47.450 --> 03:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
quick overview at CFI was uh the way
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
that ResCare fits into the CFI umbrella
 
03:38:52.010 --> 03:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
03:38:53.690 --> 03:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
there comes a point in which people
 
03:38:56.510 --> 03:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
cannot be either safely or practically
 
03:38:58.130 --> 03:38:58.140 align:start position:0%
maintained in their own homes because
 
03:39:00.469 --> 03:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
they need 24-hour supervision
 
03:39:03.170 --> 03:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
but they don't need 24-hour nursing care
 
03:39:06.290 --> 03:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
and that basically is the the slot that
 
03:39:07.969 --> 03:39:07.979 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people who need 24
 
03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
hours of supervision and some assistance
 
03:39:12.769 --> 03:39:12.779 align:start position:0%
with activities of daily living but
 
03:39:15.769 --> 03:39:15.779 align:start position:0%
don't need round-the-clock nursing care
 
03:39:18.790 --> 03:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
um Okay so
 
03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
there was uh there was a gentleman who
 
03:39:23.389 --> 03:39:23.399 align:start position:0%
was for a long an honorable gentleman
 
03:39:27.530 --> 03:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
who was for a long time the chair of the
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
um house finance committee I'm sure you
 
03:39:31.190 --> 03:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
know who I'm talking about
 
03:39:32.990 --> 03:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
um and he was famous for saying on
 
03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:34.070 align:start position:0%
um and he was famous for saying on
occasion

03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
occasion
 
03:39:35.330 --> 03:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
if you want to talk to me about
 
03:39:37.070 --> 03:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
increasing rates come to me when homes
 
03:39:38.570 --> 03:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
are closing
 
03:39:40.910 --> 03:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
well we've gotten there homes are
 
03:39:44.990 --> 03:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
closing you have a little chart here
 
03:39:46.790 --> 03:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
um this is data that I got from the
 
03:39:48.710 --> 03:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
housing excuse me Healthcare facilities
 
03:39:48.720 --> 03:39:50.090 align:start position:0%
housing excuse me Healthcare facilities
Administration

03:39:50.090 --> 03:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
03:39:52.790 --> 03:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
these are the 14 Residential Care Homes
 
03:39:56.030 --> 03:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
that have closed between uh December of
 
03:39:59.630 --> 03:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
2018 and December of 2022.
 
03:40:03.110 --> 03:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
the 14 homes represent a total of 164
 
03:40:03.120 --> 03:40:04.550 align:start position:0%
the 14 homes represent a total of 164
beds

03:40:04.550 --> 03:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
beds
 
03:40:07.610 --> 03:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
the 164 beds is relatively insignificant
 
03:40:10.389 --> 03:40:10.399 align:start position:0%
when compared to the
 
03:40:14.570 --> 03:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
6534 beds that are licensed in the state
 
03:40:17.570 --> 03:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
however eight of these homes for CFI
 
03:40:17.580 --> 03:40:18.650 align:start position:0%
however eight of these homes for CFI
providers

03:40:18.650 --> 03:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
providers
 
03:40:22.330 --> 03:40:22.340 align:start position:0%
and they totaled 121 beds
 
03:40:25.010 --> 03:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
121 beds is much more significant when
 
03:40:27.290 --> 03:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
you're talking about 500
 
03:40:29.389 --> 03:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
CFI risk care clients which is what
 
03:40:31.070 --> 03:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
03:40:34.610 --> 03:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
now the thing about the CFI the 500 CFI
 
03:40:39.410 --> 03:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
clients in 2011 there were 600.
 
03:40:39.420 --> 03:40:40.309 align:start position:0%
clients in 2011 there were 600.
um

03:40:40.309 --> 03:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:44.030 --> 03:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
and between 2010 and 2022
 
03:40:46.010 --> 03:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
the number of people in the New
 
03:40:48.769 --> 03:40:48.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who are over the age of 65
 
03:40:51.590 --> 03:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
increased by 91 000. so you might expect
 
03:40:53.389 --> 03:40:53.399 align:start position:0%
that the utilization will be going up
 
03:40:56.570 --> 03:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
but even if you look at line 505 you see
 
03:40:58.510 --> 03:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
that the utilization is still going down
 
03:41:01.550 --> 03:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
because it was 12 million dollars
 
03:41:03.650 --> 03:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
um two years ago and only 11 million
 
03:41:05.630 --> 03:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
dollars last year I believe that's
 
03:41:07.190 --> 03:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
because the department transferred on
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
expended funds out
 
03:41:10.429 --> 03:41:10.439 align:start position:0%
and the reason that those funds are
 
03:41:12.050 --> 03:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
unexpended is because there aren't the
 
03:41:15.349 --> 03:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
providers to provide the service
 
03:41:18.830 --> 03:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
um so why does it matter if this
 
03:41:20.929 --> 03:41:20.939 align:start position:0%
utilization is going down
 
03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
well there are a number of reasons but
 
03:41:23.990 --> 03:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
the biggest one is that there's a very
 
03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
significant unmet need
 
03:41:28.130 --> 03:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
now Gina when she was speaking to you
 
03:41:30.769 --> 03:41:30.779 align:start position:0%
was able to categorize the unmet need as
 
03:41:32.210 --> 03:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
the difference between the authorized
 
03:41:34.610 --> 03:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
services and the paid services
 
03:41:36.590 --> 03:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we can't do that for
 
03:41:39.349 --> 03:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
residential care because for residential
 
03:41:41.330 --> 03:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
care the services aren't authorized
 
03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
until a provider is found
 
03:41:47.389 --> 03:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
so if you look at that metric basically
 
03:41:49.790 --> 03:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent of the need is met but
 
03:41:52.070 --> 03:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
in fact people are waiting a long time
 
03:41:54.110 --> 03:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
to get a residential care bed
 
03:41:56.269 --> 03:41:56.279 align:start position:0%
I owned and operated Friendship Manor
 
03:41:58.910 --> 03:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
for 37 years we were forced to close in
 
03:42:00.830 --> 03:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
May of 2022.
 
03:42:04.070 --> 03:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
we had 22 beds typically I had three or
 
03:42:07.670 --> 03:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
four vacancies a year on average I got a
 
03:42:10.010 --> 03:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
referral a week so I got 50 to 60
 
03:42:13.190 --> 03:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
referrals a year for three or four beds
 
03:42:15.170 --> 03:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
one of the homes on your chart here
 
03:42:18.590 --> 03:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
which closed was rosehaven they were the
 
03:42:21.229 --> 03:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
home that was closest to Nashua that was
 
03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
a CFI provider
 
03:42:26.450 --> 03:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
and they had 28 beds so of course so for
 
03:42:28.670 --> 03:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
a similar number of openings they got
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
about 250 referrals a year because on
 
03:42:33.769 --> 03:42:33.779 align:start position:0%
average they got a referral a day
 
03:42:36.050 --> 03:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
just last week I was talking with one of
 
03:42:37.849 --> 03:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
the case management providers
 
03:42:42.590 --> 03:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
so so I'm I'm sorry uh could could we
 
03:42:44.990 --> 03:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
stick to the numbers you you've got a
 
03:42:47.870 --> 03:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
proposal here and your proposal says
 
03:42:50.090 --> 03:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
that there's a current rate per day of
 
03:42:53.150 --> 03:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
fifty Seven dollars uh State cost is
 
03:42:55.610 --> 03:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
28.50 and you think it should go to 80
 
03:42:58.070 --> 03:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
and the state costs will go to 40. right
 
03:43:01.070 --> 03:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
okay now you heard miss balcus talking
 
03:43:03.769 --> 03:43:03.779 align:start position:0%
or are we talking about the same line
 
03:43:06.710 --> 03:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
item or are you on a would would you be
 
03:43:09.110 --> 03:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
requiring a plus up in a different line
 
03:43:11.809 --> 03:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
we are the same line in the governor's
 
03:43:16.849 --> 03:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
budget as as Ms balcus's request okay so
 
03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
did you hear her request I did uh is her
 
03:43:24.050 --> 03:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
request redundant or complimentary with
 
03:43:25.429 --> 03:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
your switch
 
03:43:28.309 --> 03:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh it's complementary I mean our numbers
 
03:43:31.130 --> 03:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
are not included in hers or I I guess I
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question well she
 
03:43:34.490 --> 03:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
she's uh she's not saying just for her
 
03:43:36.349 --> 03:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
organization she's just saying across
 
03:43:38.090 --> 03:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
the board in CFI Services she's
 
03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
recommending various rates are you in
 
03:43:42.769 --> 03:43:42.779 align:start position:0%
agreement with her are you are you
 
03:43:44.990 --> 03:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
adding a different category that we
 
03:43:46.550 --> 03:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
should be looking at if you're going to
 
03:43:48.530 --> 03:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
be seeing the budget that way I'm in
 
03:43:50.330 --> 03:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
agreement with you but I I know that
 
03:43:52.429 --> 03:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
Gina was speaking to the need for Home
 
03:43:55.729 --> 03:43:55.739 align:start position:0%
Care not to the need for uh Residential
 
03:43:57.769 --> 03:43:57.779 align:start position:0%
Care okay so where it says home health
 
03:43:59.269 --> 03:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
aid that's different than what you're
 
03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
talking about you're talking about your
 
03:44:02.990 --> 03:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
own residential kind of setting that's
 
03:44:06.410 --> 03:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
correct okay and and is it do you think
 
03:44:10.130 --> 03:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
that's also in line 506 home support
 
03:44:12.110 --> 03:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
waiver services that doesn't sound like
 
03:44:14.570 --> 03:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
it would be there I I believe it is I
 
03:44:16.190 --> 03:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
believe that all the waiver services for
 
03:44:18.469 --> 03:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
CFI have been grouped in a single line
 
03:44:22.130 --> 03:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
but I'm not an expert on the budget okay
 
03:44:24.889 --> 03:44:24.899 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
03:44:24.899 --> 03:44:26.570 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

03:44:26.570 --> 03:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:29.150 --> 03:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
so so I think you know go ahead
 
03:44:31.550 --> 03:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
represent and we may take this up on
 
03:44:35.330 --> 03:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
March 7th would Mr White know if that is
 
03:44:35.340 --> 03:44:36.349 align:start position:0%
March 7th would Mr White know if that is
true

03:44:36.349 --> 03:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
true
 
03:44:41.330 --> 03:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:43.250 --> 03:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
we're all in agreement that there's a
 
03:44:44.809 --> 03:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
problem out there I didn't mean to cut
 
03:44:48.889 --> 03:44:48.899 align:start position:0%
off the the stories of because we know
 
03:44:50.630 --> 03:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
that they're there that's why we're here
 
03:44:54.229 --> 03:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
worrying about the money so it's not the
 
03:44:55.429 --> 03:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
other way around
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
yes so on page 934 the governor's
 
03:45:01.630 --> 03:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
recommended budget accounting unit 2152
 
03:45:01.640 --> 03:45:02.690 align:start position:0%
recommended budget accounting unit 2152
[Music]

03:45:02.690 --> 03:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:45:06.550 --> 03:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
um the the class lines of 505 506 and
 
03:45:10.370 --> 03:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
529 have been combined into that single
 
03:45:12.110 --> 03:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
class line
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
so the line that Mr Coop would need in
 
03:45:18.650 --> 03:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
order to support his CFI mid-level care
 
03:45:21.729 --> 03:45:21.739 align:start position:0%
is that also combined into
 
03:45:25.309 --> 03:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
506 yes
 
03:45:27.229 --> 03:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
all right so if you look at it that way
 
03:45:29.330 --> 03:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
then yes so so I think we have your
 
03:45:31.490 --> 03:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
testimony unless I'm grossly
 
03:45:33.410 --> 03:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
oversimplifying something uh unless you
 
03:45:34.670 --> 03:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
like to know how we arrived at our
 
03:45:38.389 --> 03:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
figure uh I I don't think so I I think I
 
03:45:39.889 --> 03:45:39.899 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have at the end of
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
the day a requirement to see how much
 
03:45:44.150 --> 03:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
money we have and where we want to
 
03:45:46.790 --> 03:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
allocate it I I think we're in a classic
 
03:45:50.030 --> 03:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
economics 101 situation if we have
 
03:45:53.210 --> 03:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
unlimited demands and limited resources
 
03:45:55.250 --> 03:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
okay so I
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
um but so thank you all right well just
 
03:45:58.610 --> 03:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
let me assure you we didn't pull it out
 
03:46:00.650 --> 03:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
of the air no I know you did I can tell
 
03:46:03.410 --> 03:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
I've worked with Alex before I don't I
 
03:46:05.150 --> 03:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sure these are extremely well
 
03:46:11.269 --> 03:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:14.210 --> 03:46:14.220 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else from the audience
 
03:46:19.130 --> 03:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:22.010 --> 03:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
okay so Mr Lipman
 
03:46:25.490 --> 03:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
um did did you feel like you and Mr
 
03:46:28.429 --> 03:46:28.439 align:start position:0%
White had gotten through your agenda for
 
03:46:28.439 --> 03:46:31.030 align:start position:0%
White had gotten through your agenda for
today

03:46:31.030 --> 03:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:34.969 --> 03:46:34.979 align:start position:0%
which was simply DHHS Division of
 
03:46:44.780 --> 03:46:44.790 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:44.790 --> 03:46:46.729 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:46:46.729 --> 03:46:46.739 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:46:46.739 --> 03:46:48.610 align:start position:0%
[Music]
foreign

03:46:48.610 --> 03:46:48.620 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:46:51.410 --> 03:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
I think the the observation is that
 
03:46:52.550 --> 03:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
we're pretty aligned with what the
 
03:46:54.110 --> 03:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
governor's budget had with the couple of
 
03:46:57.889 --> 03:46:57.899 align:start position:0%
exceptions in the proposed hb2 areas in
 
03:47:00.530 --> 03:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
terms of those things are in fact funded
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
then I think we're pretty aligned there
 
03:47:06.530 --> 03:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
um you know we mentioned I think the the
 
03:47:09.769 --> 03:47:09.779 align:start position:0%
uh state phase down that Gap there the
 
03:47:11.570 --> 03:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
03:47:15.729 --> 03:47:15.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:17.809 --> 03:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the only one I don't think
 
03:47:19.490 --> 03:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
we talked about yeah the only other
 
03:47:21.650 --> 03:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
issue um that that we didn't have an
 
03:47:23.929 --> 03:47:23.939 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address this morning
 
03:47:27.530 --> 03:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
um the mmis budget is currently included
 
03:47:31.010 --> 03:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
in the to be proposed hb2
 
03:47:33.889 --> 03:47:33.899 align:start position:0%
um and and within that is is the general
 
03:47:36.110 --> 03:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
fund portion which is roughly 10 million
 
03:47:38.030 --> 03:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
dollars annually and then the ability to
 
03:47:40.250 --> 03:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
accept the federal funds as well so so
 
03:47:42.830 --> 03:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
hp2 has the 10 million in general funds
 
03:47:45.229 --> 03:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
also is or is that 10 million in hp1
 
03:47:47.809 --> 03:47:47.819 align:start position:0%
somewhere it has so it has an
 
03:47:50.150 --> 03:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation it's a total I believe
 
03:47:51.950 --> 03:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's a little over 20 million dollars
 
03:47:53.809 --> 03:47:53.819 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head of General funds
 
03:47:55.969 --> 03:47:55.979 align:start position:0%
and then plus the matching federal
 
03:47:59.450 --> 03:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
dollars and um that that is consistent
 
03:48:01.130 --> 03:48:01.140 align:start position:0%
with the way that that was budgeted in
 
03:48:03.170 --> 03:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
this current biennium I hear you I'm
 
03:48:05.030 --> 03:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
just wondering if any of the general
 
03:48:06.889 --> 03:48:06.899 align:start position:0%
funds that you're referring to if
 
03:48:09.170 --> 03:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
they're in the governor's budget in HP
 
03:48:12.769 --> 03:48:12.779 align:start position:0%
one or if they're all referenced in hb2
 
03:48:15.349 --> 03:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
all in hb2 okay that's that's my
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
question all right
 
03:48:18.000 --> 03:48:18.590 align:start position:0%
question all right
um

03:48:18.590 --> 03:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:21.889 --> 03:48:21.899 align:start position:0%
yes sir just to clarify did you say 10
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
million or 20 million
 
03:48:25.729 --> 03:48:25.739 align:start position:0%
roughly 10 million dollars a year 20
 
03:48:27.650 --> 03:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars over the biennium so so
 
03:48:29.450 --> 03:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
I I can pull the number up if you'd like
 
03:48:31.190 --> 03:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
well I'm looking at the what we got from
 
03:48:33.590 --> 03:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
LBA which is 20 million allocated out of
 
03:48:35.389 --> 03:48:35.399 align:start position:0%
our Surplus in 2023 so I guess that
 
03:48:37.190 --> 03:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
means 10 million a year you're expecting
 
03:48:40.010 --> 03:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
to spend yeah yeah the the 20.5 million
 
03:48:44.030 --> 03:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:47.110 --> 03:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
and the Federal's about uh double that
 
03:48:47.120 --> 03:48:48.849 align:start position:0%
and the Federal's about uh double that
is

03:48:48.849 --> 03:48:48.859 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
an equivalent amount the on mmis there's
 
03:48:56.630 --> 03:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
um a little bit enhanced funding
 
03:49:01.010 --> 03:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
um some of it's 75 25 75 Federal so it
 
03:49:04.429 --> 03:49:04.439 align:start position:0%
waits out to over 60 percent uh uh in
 
03:49:06.170 --> 03:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
that that particular line
 
03:49:10.070 --> 03:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you so so I'm gonna I'm
 
03:49:12.710 --> 03:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
gonna consider your portion on Medicaid
 
03:49:15.229 --> 03:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
complete is that fair
 
03:49:18.349 --> 03:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to close out the uh
 
03:49:20.510 --> 03:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid portion and we're going to
 
03:49:22.550 --> 03:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
go back was there another question did I
 
03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
miss a question
 
03:49:27.110 --> 03:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay so I want to go back to uh
 
03:49:30.769 --> 03:49:30.779 align:start position:0%
reopening on 527.
 
03:49:34.729 --> 03:49:34.739 align:start position:0%
um 527 is a proposal to raise a Medicaid
 
03:49:39.290 --> 03:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate from 102 115 dollars
 
03:49:41.870 --> 03:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
per day for assisted living facilities
 
03:49:44.030 --> 03:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh and they're going after the small
 
03:49:46.130 --> 03:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
ones and I think that's what Mr Coop was
 
03:49:49.429 --> 03:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
talking about earlier do you Mr Lipman
 
03:49:51.290 --> 03:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
you ran away I was going to ask you
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:59.809 --> 03:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
do you have any testimony to offer us on
 
03:49:59.819 --> 03:50:02.150 align:start position:0%
do you have any testimony to offer us on
527

03:50:02.150 --> 03:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
527
 
03:50:05.690 --> 03:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
. there's an amendment to from uh Ripple
 
03:50:09.190 --> 03:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
on on that uh the original proposal
 
03:50:13.010 --> 03:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
targeted certain facilities by bid and
 
03:50:15.290 --> 03:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
that's not an allowable way for us to
 
03:50:19.490 --> 03:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
raise the rates and um we have an
 
03:50:22.670 --> 03:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
analysis uh that I sent to Mr Ripple I
 
03:50:24.410 --> 03:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's made its way to
 
03:50:26.389 --> 03:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I haven't handed that out yet okay
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
as far as the amendment goes there was
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
an amendment offered by Representatives
 
03:50:31.969 --> 03:50:31.979 align:start position:0%
Morgan and Petri I emailed that out but
 
03:50:33.889 --> 03:50:33.899 align:start position:0%
I also have hard copies if anybody needs
 
03:50:33.899 --> 03:50:37.610 align:start position:0%
I also have hard copies if anybody needs
one

03:50:37.610 --> 03:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:37.620 --> 03:51:06.290 align:start position:0%
 
Kevin

03:51:06.290 --> 03:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:08.630 --> 03:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
you just came back yeah right it looks
 
03:51:23.030 --> 03:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:02.830 --> 03:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:05.330 --> 03:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
didn't that change right
 
03:52:05.340 --> 03:52:13.450 align:start position:0%
didn't that change right
um

03:52:13.450 --> 03:52:13.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:16.550 --> 03:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
if if you're ready for us to say
 
03:52:20.030 --> 03:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
anything yeah uh go go ahead are you are
 
03:52:22.490 --> 03:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
you ready to talk to the amendment that
 
03:52:24.410 --> 03:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
we've offered do you're going to give us
 
03:52:26.450 --> 03:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
some information I you're obviously not
 
03:52:29.090 --> 03:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
here to defend the amendment I'm just
 
03:52:32.030 --> 03:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
asking you to explain the amendment as
 
03:52:34.309 --> 03:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
you understand that sure
 
03:52:36.290 --> 03:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
um just with me if you want to introduce
 
03:52:36.300 --> 03:52:38.210 align:start position:0%
um just with me if you want to introduce
yourselves

03:52:38.210 --> 03:52:38.220 align:start position:0%
yourselves
 
03:52:40.010 --> 03:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
I'm Christy Roy with rate setting at
 
03:52:40.020 --> 03:52:42.769 align:start position:0%
I'm Christy Roy with rate setting at
DHHS

03:52:42.769 --> 03:52:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:44.330 --> 03:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
Rob Berry general counsel of the
 
03:52:45.950 --> 03:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
division of Medicaid
 
03:52:48.830 --> 03:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
and um Christie's the individual that
 
03:52:51.530 --> 03:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
has run these numbers but I guess the
 
03:52:54.889 --> 03:52:54.899 align:start position:0%
punch line is to to treat all facilities
 
03:52:56.590 --> 03:52:56.600 align:start position:0%
in the same class
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
equally at the 115 rate is over 10
 
03:53:02.389 --> 03:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
million dollar impact
 
03:53:02.399 --> 03:53:03.050 align:start position:0%
million dollar impact
um

03:53:03.050 --> 03:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:03.060 --> 03:53:04.610 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:53:04.610 --> 03:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:53:06.410 --> 03:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
on top of what other things you've heard
 
03:53:06.420 --> 03:53:08.809 align:start position:0%
on top of what other things you've heard
today

03:53:08.809 --> 03:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:10.729 --> 03:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
so I got to keep coming back to simple
 
03:53:13.550 --> 03:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
things so the original proposal was just
 
03:53:15.410 --> 03:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
for small facilities and what I think
 
03:53:17.929 --> 03:53:17.939 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing you say is we're prohibited
 
03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
from considering them on that basis we
 
03:53:23.030 --> 03:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
have to generalize and do a broader
 
03:53:25.790 --> 03:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
class and that broader class if we did
 
03:53:28.070 --> 03:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
115 is going to cost us 10 million
 
03:53:29.809 --> 03:53:29.819 align:start position:0%
dollars is that what you just said the
 
03:53:31.849 --> 03:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
rate is for a service not for a type of
 
03:53:33.769 --> 03:53:33.779 align:start position:0%
facility it's not a facility specific or
 
03:53:35.510 --> 03:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
a facility based rate it's a service
 
03:53:38.590 --> 03:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
based rate so regardless if it's this
 
03:53:41.389 --> 03:53:41.399 align:start position:0%
Hep 804 licensed or I believe the other
 
03:53:43.490 --> 03:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
one was an 805 license if it's the same
 
03:53:45.229 --> 03:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
service they need to receive the same
 
03:53:45.239 --> 03:53:46.130 align:start position:0%
service they need to receive the same
rate

03:53:46.130 --> 03:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
rate
 
03:53:48.290 --> 03:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
it's a service based rate
 
03:53:51.590 --> 03:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
so if it's if they're proposing 115 per
 
03:53:53.750 --> 03:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
day what what are they getting now do
 
03:53:57.229 --> 03:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:59.929 --> 03:53:59.939 align:start position:0%
is 56
 
03:54:02.210 --> 03:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
56 that level of care which was the one
 
03:54:05.510 --> 03:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
that the provider was discussing so so
 
03:54:07.670 --> 03:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
you're not talking to this document are
 
03:54:09.070 --> 03:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
you yes
 
03:54:11.389 --> 03:54:11.399 align:start position:0%
a document that you had asked for last
 
03:54:13.190 --> 03:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
time so it has the rate change over time
 
03:54:18.110 --> 03:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
yeah the last rate the 56.88 that's the
 
03:54:20.450 --> 03:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
standard Residential Care rate the other
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
levels are additional services so it's a
 
03:54:25.969 --> 03:54:25.979 align:start position:0%
different dementia additional service
 
03:54:27.530 --> 03:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
required rate which is why they were
 
03:54:27.540 --> 03:54:28.490 align:start position:0%
required rate which is why they were
higher

03:54:28.490 --> 03:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
higher
 
03:54:31.910 --> 03:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
so so that's almost a sixty dollar a day
 
03:54:31.920 --> 03:54:33.349 align:start position:0%
so so that's almost a sixty dollar a day
increase

03:54:33.349 --> 03:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:54:42.469 --> 03:54:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
03:54:47.570 --> 03:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
can you remind us what the other
 
03:54:49.790 --> 03:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
service wise because they were drawing a
 
03:54:52.010 --> 03:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
distinction between the two services and
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
and providing reasoning as I recall for
 
03:54:57.290 --> 03:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
why theirs should be increased
 
03:55:00.290 --> 03:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
independently correct they were saying
 
03:55:02.269 --> 03:55:02.279 align:start position:0%
their specific rate because they were
 
03:55:05.389 --> 03:55:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:07.969 --> 03:55:07.979 align:start position:0%
if you look at the the handout the
 
03:55:09.889 --> 03:55:09.899 align:start position:0%
dementia level one and dementia level
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
two those are the other rates it's the
 
03:55:13.910 --> 03:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
same code it's the same service but
 
03:55:16.210 --> 03:55:16.220 align:start position:0%
we're saying for these other if you have
 
03:55:18.710 --> 03:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
dementia level one you actually require
 
03:55:21.229 --> 03:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
more services and therefore receive a
 
03:55:22.910 --> 03:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
higher rate and then there's an
 
03:55:24.889 --> 03:55:24.899 align:start position:0%
additional dimensional level where it
 
03:55:26.570 --> 03:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
would be another higher rate so those
 
03:55:28.130 --> 03:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
are the three rates so those are the
 
03:55:29.689 --> 03:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
additional two levels of service that
 
03:55:32.090 --> 03:55:32.100 align:start position:0%
they were talking about it's dementia
 
03:55:32.100 --> 03:55:33.889 align:start position:0%
they were talking about it's dementia
level

03:55:33.889 --> 03:55:33.899 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
severity Acuity if you would on the
 
03:55:39.050 --> 03:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
service do you have a follow-up okay so
 
03:55:42.830 --> 03:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
by extension then the 115 is that would
 
03:55:45.650 --> 03:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
is their proposed new base and the other
 
03:55:48.769 --> 03:55:48.779 align:start position:0%
rates logically should be higher than
 
03:55:52.070 --> 03:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
that in order to maintain the relative
 
03:55:52.080 --> 03:55:53.210 align:start position:0%
that in order to maintain the relative
structure

03:55:53.210 --> 03:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
structure
 
03:55:55.969 --> 03:55:55.979 align:start position:0%
correct but as we as it was written we
 
03:55:59.990 --> 03:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
increased that 10.5 was 115 for all
 
03:56:01.729 --> 03:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
three levels
 
03:56:04.729 --> 03:56:04.739 align:start position:0%
okay so but that's not logically
 
03:56:07.370 --> 03:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
consistent so so it would be up to
 
03:56:09.050 --> 03:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
somebody logical that we'll never find
 
03:56:12.469 --> 03:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
in the state house to to figure out what
 
03:56:15.050 --> 03:56:15.060 align:start position:0%
what the relative adjustments ought to
 
03:56:17.450 --> 03:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
be and whatever adjustment up there is
 
03:56:19.610 --> 03:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
in the other two lines it's going to go
 
03:56:21.290 --> 03:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
over the 10 million that you've already
 
03:56:23.630 --> 03:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
predicted that's correct we would follow
 
03:56:26.450 --> 03:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
what is in the bill okay and then to the
 
03:56:28.849 --> 03:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
council have you read the amendment is
 
03:56:30.830 --> 03:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
this is this legally sufficient is this
 
03:56:32.269 --> 03:56:32.279 align:start position:0%
is this the right way to write this
 
03:56:34.610 --> 03:56:34.620 align:start position:0%
other than the dollar amount I'm not
 
03:56:37.790 --> 03:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
asking you to to validate the 115 I'm
 
03:56:39.590 --> 03:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
just asking you to validate the
 
03:56:41.510 --> 03:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
boilerplate around it so what this
 
03:56:43.610 --> 03:56:43.620 align:start position:0%
amendment would do would just in effect
 
03:56:46.790 --> 03:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
increase the rate for that Top Line the
 
03:56:48.550 --> 03:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
lowest level of Acuity
 
03:56:52.370 --> 03:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
so logically speaking it wouldn't be
 
03:56:54.530 --> 03:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
sufficient and I don't think it would be
 
03:57:00.670 --> 03:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:03.110 --> 03:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay let's go with the representative
 
03:57:05.929 --> 03:57:05.939 align:start position:0%
Stringham and then representative
 
03:57:09.349 --> 03:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
all right all right I I appreciate what
 
03:57:10.849 --> 03:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
you're saying about the size of the
 
03:57:13.189 --> 03:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
facility do you know if it's also
 
03:57:17.210 --> 03:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
um uh illegal or inappropriate to to
 
03:57:20.630 --> 03:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
base a difference in payment on the uh
 
03:57:22.849 --> 03:57:22.859 align:start position:0%
on the payer mix so say if the payer mix
 
03:57:25.550 --> 03:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
is more than 50 percent Medicaid that a
 
03:57:27.349 --> 03:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
different rate may apply
 
03:57:29.510 --> 03:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
so it's this service again it's a
 
03:57:31.729 --> 03:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
service based rate so if we could
 
03:57:31.739 --> 03:57:32.870 align:start position:0%
service based rate so if we could
somehow

03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
Define and identify that the Medicaid
 
03:57:37.790 --> 03:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
clientele were requiring additional
 
03:57:37.800 --> 03:57:38.990 align:start position:0%
clientele were requiring additional
services

03:57:38.990 --> 03:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:57:41.570 --> 03:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
there would be an opportunity maybe to
 
03:57:44.210 --> 03:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
create another rate but again it's a
 
03:57:47.389 --> 03:57:47.399 align:start position:0%
service based rate so to adjustify a
 
03:57:49.130 --> 03:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
rate change it would have to be because
 
03:57:51.650 --> 03:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
of the additional service they're all
 
03:57:53.950 --> 03:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
the same class of Provider as far as
 
03:57:56.090 --> 03:57:56.100 align:start position:0%
providing Residential Care whoever is
 
03:57:59.210 --> 03:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:01.189 --> 03:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
not speaking to the amendment but
 
03:58:03.950 --> 03:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
speaking to the concept of targeted rate
 
03:58:06.170 --> 03:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
increases this might be an example where
 
03:58:07.910 --> 03:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
the current reimbursement methodology
 
03:58:10.189 --> 03:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
drives us to a solution that's not
 
03:58:12.650 --> 03:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
implementable just on the cost of it you
 
03:58:14.750 --> 03:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
know for example nursing homes are based
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
on a I'm not saying this is a solution
 
03:58:18.769 --> 03:58:18.779 align:start position:0%
but nursing homes have a cost-based
 
03:58:21.410 --> 03:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
methodology based on the cost that they
 
03:58:24.110 --> 03:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
accumulate that we pay pay Medicaid
 
03:58:27.229 --> 03:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
defined costs this particular service
 
03:58:31.250 --> 03:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
based methodology is it problematic to
 
03:58:34.070 --> 03:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
as we've outlined here but that's that's
 
03:58:36.110 --> 03:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
where the complexity of all this gets
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
into once you start
 
03:58:40.429 --> 03:58:40.439 align:start position:0%
scratching the surface you have to go
 
03:58:42.530 --> 03:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
deeper right if you see that in the
 
03:58:44.030 --> 03:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
handout there's I leave one for
 
03:58:45.769 --> 03:58:45.779 align:start position:0%
Connecticut a rate for Connecticut in
 
03:58:48.110 --> 03:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
there and in that rate I did put in a
 
03:58:50.389 --> 03:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
median and a mean because they are a
 
03:58:53.450 --> 03:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
cost report based rate
 
03:58:56.090 --> 03:58:56.100 align:start position:0%
um so they have facility specific rates
 
03:58:58.610 --> 03:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
targeted based on a cost report when you
 
03:59:00.110 --> 03:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
open that up you're talking about having
 
03:59:02.030 --> 03:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
everyone fill out a cost report you're
 
03:59:04.610 --> 03:59:04.620 align:start position:0%
talking about auditing program Integrity
 
03:59:08.330 --> 03:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of additional nuances to a
 
03:59:10.910 --> 03:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
facility specific rate
 
03:59:13.010 --> 03:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
so quick follow-up that when you look at
 
03:59:14.990 --> 03:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
the other states that they have one rate
 
03:59:18.229 --> 03:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
it's largely uh because it's cost based
 
03:59:20.450 --> 03:59:20.460 align:start position:0%
and so therefore there's not a they
 
03:59:21.950 --> 03:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily distinguish the
 
03:59:24.229 --> 03:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
service the tractor within their
 
03:59:30.710 --> 03:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:34.189 --> 03:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
so I think I heard that the amendment is
 
03:59:36.410 --> 03:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
written without respect to the dollar
 
03:59:39.769 --> 03:59:39.779 align:start position:0%
amount is legally sufficient it's it's
 
03:59:43.010 --> 03:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
good it's good legislative language but
 
03:59:46.550 --> 03:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
what I think I'm hearing you say also is
 
03:59:48.050 --> 03:59:48.060 align:start position:0%
that this hundred and fifteen dollars
 
03:59:50.870 --> 03:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
per day is problematic because it feels
 
03:59:53.570 --> 03:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
like it's a service based calculation
 
03:59:56.210 --> 03:59:56.220 align:start position:0%
and not a cost based calculation which
 
03:59:59.809 --> 03:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
is required by the regs I think what I
 
04:00:02.689 --> 04:00:02.699 align:start position:0%
was saying is that by stating four
 
04:00:07.910 --> 04:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
specifically stating for Hep 804a RC
 
04:00:10.729 --> 04:00:10.739 align:start position:0%
licensees is the problem that's the
 
04:00:12.769 --> 04:00:12.779 align:start position:0%
challenge because there are also my
 
04:00:14.510 --> 04:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is 805 facilities
 
04:00:17.210 --> 04:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
providing the same service so you
 
04:00:19.309 --> 04:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
couldn't Target it so that was what I
 
04:00:20.990 --> 04:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
was suggesting and I think the secondary
 
04:00:23.389 --> 04:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
one was the Acuity factor is that the
 
04:00:24.830 --> 04:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
lowest rate would have the highest rate
 
04:00:26.689 --> 04:00:26.699 align:start position:0%
in the higher Acuity would have a lower
 
04:00:30.050 --> 04:00:30.060 align:start position:0%
rate so that's that's uh so does the
 
04:00:31.790 --> 04:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
department have a recommendation to fix
 
04:00:31.800 --> 04:00:32.809 align:start position:0%
department have a recommendation to fix
this

04:00:32.809 --> 04:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:00:34.670 --> 04:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
that's I guess what I was getting at I
 
04:00:36.530 --> 04:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
think in terms of a targeted rate
 
04:00:38.210 --> 04:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
approach would allow us to change the
 
04:00:41.229 --> 04:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
methodology we could work on something
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
but that isn't something we can do in a
 
04:00:45.050 --> 04:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
week or two it's
 
04:00:48.410 --> 04:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
part of a bigger overhaul of of this
 
04:00:51.110 --> 04:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
particular area which it is a waiver
 
04:00:53.689 --> 04:00:53.699 align:start position:0%
based rate it's a CFI waiver rate which
 
04:00:56.990 --> 04:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
has a CFI waiver methodology in it where
 
04:00:59.269 --> 04:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
similar to the other waivers what is
 
04:01:01.610 --> 04:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
going on right now with rebasing them
 
04:01:03.710 --> 04:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
having them fill out cost surveys all of
 
04:01:06.290 --> 04:01:06.300 align:start position:0%
the providers are it's similar to that
 
04:01:09.050 --> 04:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
it's a waiver so so what's the quickest
 
04:01:13.429 --> 04:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
you could you could propose a rate
 
04:01:15.349 --> 04:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
and do it right
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
it's just it's a minimum of three months
 
04:01:22.910 --> 04:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
six months I guess it's
 
04:01:26.090 --> 04:01:26.100 align:start position:0%
if it was a loan right it would take I
 
04:01:27.710 --> 04:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
think let's do alone and then in the
 
04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
aggregate I think it could take three to
 
04:01:31.670 --> 04:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
six months depending on the back and
 
04:01:34.490 --> 04:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
forth with CMS on the methodology and
 
04:01:37.010 --> 04:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
um to implement and get the facilities
 
04:01:39.229 --> 04:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
to be able to do a cost report might
 
04:01:41.689 --> 04:01:41.699 align:start position:0%
take longer as well in terms of their
 
04:01:43.910 --> 04:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
ability to adapt to that that payment
 
04:01:46.670 --> 04:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
methodology you know that so I think in
 
04:01:48.290 --> 04:01:48.300 align:start position:0%
terms of our part we probably could do
 
04:01:48.300 --> 04:01:49.070 align:start position:0%
terms of our part we probably could do
and

04:01:49.070 --> 04:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:52.729 --> 04:01:52.739 align:start position:0%
in isolation in three to six months
 
04:01:55.189 --> 04:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
okay but given that we've asked you for
 
04:01:58.010 --> 04:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
a larger piece of homework what what
 
04:01:59.750 --> 04:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
what what what what do you think you're
 
04:02:03.229 --> 04:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
going to need for the the whole
 
04:02:06.170 --> 04:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
and this the scheme of what we have in
 
04:02:08.809 --> 04:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
front of us into in terms of looking at
 
04:02:08.819 --> 04:02:09.590 align:start position:0%
front of us into in terms of looking at
um

04:02:09.590 --> 04:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:11.870 --> 04:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
you know I think we we feel like we
 
04:02:14.950 --> 04:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
would need no less than six months to do
 
04:02:17.870 --> 04:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
the sort of the targeted kind of
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
analytic work and then if that requires
 
04:02:23.330 --> 04:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
state plan amendments and some other
 
04:02:25.189 --> 04:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
things that it would take us some time
 
04:02:26.990 --> 04:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
beyond that say another
 
04:02:29.450 --> 04:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
it may take nine months to a year to
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
work all the way through this whole so
 
04:02:34.370 --> 04:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
so hypothetically if if uh division
 
04:02:38.450 --> 04:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
three recommended a finance to retain HB
 
04:02:42.950 --> 04:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
527 and pick it back up in January of
 
04:02:45.530 --> 04:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
next year might there
 
04:02:48.530 --> 04:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
be more homework that's been done that
 
04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
we could figure out the right way to do
 
04:02:52.910 --> 04:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
this rate setting
 
04:02:55.429 --> 04:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
I think that would be true I think it
 
04:02:57.590 --> 04:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
also may be true depending on what other
 
04:02:59.269 --> 04:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
options you're considering on rates of
 
04:03:01.130 --> 04:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
whether there's something that could be
 
04:03:03.650 --> 04:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
done you know in the interim if we're
 
04:03:05.170 --> 04:03:05.180 align:start position:0%
losing facilities
 
04:03:07.790 --> 04:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
so I am worried about that looking at
 
04:03:09.769 --> 04:03:09.779 align:start position:0%
this list of Residential Care Home
 
04:03:12.950 --> 04:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
closures there's quite a lot of them and
 
04:03:14.290 --> 04:03:14.300 align:start position:0%
I just wonder
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
what what the department thinks we may
 
04:03:22.610 --> 04:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
want to do to just stop the bleeding
 
04:03:25.490 --> 04:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
I would I would want to consult with the
 
04:03:27.889 --> 04:03:27.899 align:start position:0%
program area in this in this instance in
 
04:03:29.929 --> 04:03:29.939 align:start position:0%
terms of what what that needs to be I'm
 
04:03:32.990 --> 04:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
I apologize it's that's not an area that
 
04:03:35.090 --> 04:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
I'm an expert
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
so what do you all think what do you
 
04:03:40.090 --> 04:03:40.100 align:start position:0%
think you got something going on
 
04:03:43.189 --> 04:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
I I might have something going on
 
04:03:46.849 --> 04:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
um because we're a department of four
 
04:03:49.130 --> 04:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
people in rate setting right now
 
04:03:51.530 --> 04:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
um we do have outsourced with other
 
04:03:53.689 --> 04:03:53.699 align:start position:0%
vendors for some of these waiver rates
 
04:03:56.450 --> 04:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
that they're looking at and it's
 
04:03:58.429 --> 04:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of providers
 
04:03:58.439 --> 04:03:59.990 align:start position:0%
a lot of providers
and

04:03:59.990 --> 04:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
um it definitely takes time to do it
 
04:04:04.250 --> 04:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
well I think
 
04:04:06.050 --> 04:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
if you remember the nursing facility
 
04:04:07.490 --> 04:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
increase and the challenges that
 
04:04:10.010 --> 04:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
happened with that type of increase own
 
04:04:11.689 --> 04:04:11.699 align:start position:0%
across the board increases challenging
 
04:04:13.849 --> 04:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
for our for the department and for the
 
04:04:16.490 --> 04:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
state and I think what Henry maybe have
 
04:04:19.130 --> 04:04:19.140 align:start position:0%
is like alluding to is that the rates
 
04:04:20.809 --> 04:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
aren't consistent across the board for
 
04:04:23.809 --> 04:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
each provider segment
 
04:04:23.819 --> 04:04:24.889 align:start position:0%
each provider segment
um

04:04:24.889 --> 04:04:24.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:28.070 --> 04:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:30.830 --> 04:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
obviously another Band-Aid could be put
 
04:04:33.050 --> 04:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
it would be a Band-Aid so if the
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid could stop the bleeding and
 
04:04:37.429 --> 04:04:37.439 align:start position:0%
keep us from closing down prematurely
 
04:04:39.410 --> 04:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
any more of these facilities do you have
 
04:04:42.650 --> 04:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
an idea what we might want to do in the
 
04:04:43.969 --> 04:04:43.979 align:start position:0%
short term
 
04:04:46.130 --> 04:04:46.140 align:start position:0%
I I want you to feel good that you're
 
04:04:48.530 --> 04:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
doing your job properly it's going to
 
04:04:52.389 --> 04:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
take time but what do we do about the
 
04:04:55.550 --> 04:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
immediate situation
 
04:04:58.910 --> 04:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
I guess what I would ask if we could on
 
04:05:00.410 --> 04:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
March 7th you're going to be meeting
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
with the CFI group of that we need to
 
04:05:05.210 --> 04:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
get input from the director in that area
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
to give you a good answer I feel I'd be
 
04:05:10.610 --> 04:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
overstepping my program knowledge to to
 
04:05:12.769 --> 04:05:12.779 align:start position:0%
give you a direct answer and I apologize
 
04:05:16.490 --> 04:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
just that's all right I I uh so so I
 
04:05:18.110 --> 04:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
think what what we're going to do you
 
04:05:20.689 --> 04:05:20.699 align:start position:0%
have any last comments Mr counselor or
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh we got representative Holt with a
 
04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:30.830 --> 04:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm hearing you may be coming
 
04:05:33.889 --> 04:05:33.899 align:start position:0%
back for the March 7th potentially
 
04:05:36.590 --> 04:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
is it possible I understand that there's
 
04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
a fee per service I understand why
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
legally that has to be done
 
04:05:43.450 --> 04:05:43.460 align:start position:0%
but there's also some sort of
 
04:05:45.889 --> 04:05:45.899 align:start position:0%
incremental cost there's a there's a
 
04:05:48.710 --> 04:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
base cost to have any facility that is a
 
04:05:50.150 --> 04:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
function of the number of beds and then
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's an incremental cost for each
 
04:05:54.410 --> 04:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
patient that is in that facility is
 
04:05:56.510 --> 04:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
there a way of structuring it based on
 
04:05:58.929 --> 04:05:58.939 align:start position:0%
instead of per service
 
04:06:02.030 --> 04:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
per some baseline that groups them into
 
04:06:04.610 --> 04:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
small medium large or something because
 
04:06:06.650 --> 04:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
the inherent cost for a kitchen and all
 
04:06:08.389 --> 04:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
the other support facilities that are
 
04:06:10.729 --> 04:06:10.739 align:start position:0%
necessary to have patient one is right
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
is there is there a base slash margin
 
04:06:16.010 --> 04:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
model that also could work and would be
 
04:06:18.769 --> 04:06:18.779 align:start position:0%
legal I would definitely say that's not
 
04:06:22.729 --> 04:06:22.739 align:start position:0%
a Medicaid rate because the Medicaid
 
04:06:23.990 --> 04:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
rate and what we're looking at today
 
04:06:26.210 --> 04:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
does not include room and board so when
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a lot of those
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
overhead expenses that are room and
 
04:06:31.070 --> 04:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
board this is for the Residential Care
 
04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
room and board is not reimbursed through
 
04:06:36.769 --> 04:06:36.779 align:start position:0%
Medicaid unless it's an Institutional
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
rate so that would really only be for a
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
few facilities like hospitals nursing
 
04:06:43.429 --> 04:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
facilities and like
 
04:06:45.530 --> 04:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
I think when we were taught
 
04:06:47.150 --> 04:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
the one we were talking about a
 
04:06:49.130 --> 04:06:49.140 align:start position:0%
cost-based methodology it was moving in
 
04:06:50.809 --> 04:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
the direction that you're suggesting
 
04:06:53.110 --> 04:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
which is being able to take into account
 
04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable costs for the volume that
 
04:06:58.269 --> 04:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
that they're delivering
 
04:07:00.590 --> 04:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up it kind of along the same
 
04:07:03.349 --> 04:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
lines whether right I was using the
 
04:07:05.929 --> 04:07:05.939 align:start position:0%
analogy of of room and board related
 
04:07:07.969 --> 04:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
things but if you're sending someone in
 
04:07:10.490 --> 04:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
to serve one patient the cost for that
 
04:07:12.590 --> 04:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
one patient is significantly higher than
 
04:07:14.510 --> 04:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
them going to see three or four at the
 
04:07:18.490 --> 04:07:18.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
so correct right but so if you're
 
04:07:24.530 --> 04:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
talking about reimbursing a service I
 
04:07:27.229 --> 04:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
think now you're considering what is a
 
04:07:27.239 --> 04:07:28.370 align:start position:0%
think now you're considering what is a
reasonable

04:07:28.370 --> 04:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
Service employee to bed ratio right and
 
04:07:35.330 --> 04:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
then would the state want to look at a
 
04:07:37.670 --> 04:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
limit to that is it okay to have a
 
04:07:40.250 --> 04:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
one-to-one if really a you know one
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
service worker to four is adequate and
 
04:07:44.150 --> 04:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate and would you want to be
 
04:07:46.010 --> 04:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
paying for a one to one over one to four
 
04:07:47.389 --> 04:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
so I think there are definitely more
 
04:07:50.330 --> 04:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
intricacies to think about in that
 
04:07:52.969 --> 04:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
and we have done this in the nursing
 
04:07:52.979 --> 04:07:53.689 align:start position:0%
and we have done this in the nursing
home

04:07:53.689 --> 04:07:53.699 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
where we recognize for example Capital
 
04:07:59.450 --> 04:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
costs at a certain percentile so I think
 
04:08:01.490 --> 04:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
all these things are doable they're just
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
they take time to execute on
 
04:08:06.769 --> 04:08:06.779 align:start position:0%
so what I think I've heard is we're not
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
going to solve this today
 
04:08:10.610 --> 04:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
we're going to bring it back up on March
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
7th so Mr Ripple if we could add HB 527
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
back to the calendar on the 7th of March
 
04:08:18.479 --> 04:08:19.750 align:start position:0%
back to the calendar on the 7th of March
please

04:08:19.750 --> 04:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:08:19.760 --> 04:08:21.290 align:start position:0%
please
and

04:08:21.290 --> 04:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:08:23.750 --> 04:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
um you you have a last call you got
 
04:08:25.370 --> 04:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
anything you want to say there uh I'm
 
04:08:28.130 --> 04:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
all set thank you okay March 7th just to
 
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
be clear you're looking for what would
 
04:08:31.610 --> 04:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
be sort of a stop Gap
 
04:08:35.389 --> 04:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
answer on March 7th and yes and
 
04:08:38.090 --> 04:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
confirmation that you think you would be
 
04:08:40.370 --> 04:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
able to have a good answer
 
04:08:45.889 --> 04:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
an actionable answer by January of 2024.
 
04:08:48.290 --> 04:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
okay okay and and do you like your job
 
04:08:50.510 --> 04:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
if we give you 10 more are you going to
 
04:08:51.769 --> 04:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
stay or are you looking into
 
04:08:51.779 --> 04:08:54.229 align:start position:0%
stay or are you looking into
Massachusetts

04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
04:08:57.130 --> 04:08:57.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
very good very good all right well thank
 
04:09:04.750 --> 04:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
you so much and with that uh HP
 
04:09:04.760 --> 04:09:07.929 align:start position:0%
you so much and with that uh HP
527.

04:09:07.929 --> 04:09:07.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:11.570 --> 04:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
okay on my calendar which may be wrong I
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
show we have an hb527 next Monday is
 
04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
that really on Tuesday
 
04:09:17.870 --> 04:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
or did I just have something that
 
04:09:20.570 --> 04:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong there that was today's I
 
04:09:22.010 --> 04:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
think was the schedule for next week too
 
04:09:24.469 --> 04:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
yes oh uh well that was a mistake so
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll just delete it yes okay thanks
 
04:09:28.969 --> 04:09:28.979 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:09:34.130 --> 04:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
okay so we're gonna recess 527 till 7
 
04:09:37.729 --> 04:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
March at a time TBD
 
04:09:40.969 --> 04:09:40.979 align:start position:0%
with that I think we're ready to open at
 
04:09:43.189 --> 04:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
two o'clock we were scheduled to listen
 
04:09:46.429 --> 04:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
to the division of children youth and
 
04:09:46.439 --> 04:09:47.510 align:start position:0%
to the division of children youth and
Families

04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
Families
 
04:09:47.520 --> 04:10:08.830 align:start position:0%

04:10:11.269 --> 04:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
I didn't know what I was doing last year
 
04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
and it was so much easier
 
04:10:18.229 --> 04:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit of milk it is so dangerous
 
04:10:39.530 --> 04:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:42.410 --> 04:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
we're just having a sidebar we'll be
 
04:11:44.389 --> 04:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.399 --> 04:11:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's a little after two o'clock we're
 
04:11:54.410 --> 04:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
gonna open a work session division three
 
04:12:00.650 --> 04:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:02.689 --> 04:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh Nathan white Chief
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer Health and Human
 
04:12:03.840 --> 04:12:04.969 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer Health and Human
Services

04:12:04.969 --> 04:12:04.979 align:start position:0%
Services
 
04:12:06.769 --> 04:12:06.779 align:start position:0%
um before you there are a couple of
 
04:12:07.969 --> 04:12:07.979 align:start position:0%
documents and I just want to take a
 
04:12:10.070 --> 04:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
moment just to orient everybody to them
 
04:12:13.330 --> 04:12:13.340 align:start position:0%
so we have the PowerPoint presentation
 
04:12:17.090 --> 04:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
that and uh director ribsum is going to
 
04:12:20.030 --> 04:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
be going through that to orient you to
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
the appropriate page of the governor's
 
04:12:26.689 --> 04:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
recommended budget it's page 875 is
 
04:12:28.429 --> 04:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
where we start
 
04:12:33.110 --> 04:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
and we also provided you with a copy of
 
04:12:36.290 --> 04:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
the budget briefing book for for dcyf
 
04:12:38.450 --> 04:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
and and Prime that will primarily be
 
04:12:39.769 --> 04:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
there for reference unless there's
 
04:12:41.389 --> 04:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
specific questions
 
04:12:44.570 --> 04:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
and then we also provided to you a
 
04:12:46.309 --> 04:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
document this is the dcyf position
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
movement there were a number of
 
04:12:50.330 --> 04:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
positions that were being moved around
 
04:12:51.830 --> 04:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
through the accounts and I was kind of
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
envisioning how that conversation would
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
go and I probably wouldn't be able to
 
04:12:57.530 --> 04:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
explain it adequately so
 
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
um what we did is uh the team put this
 
04:13:02.330 --> 04:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
together Rebecca Lord and our finance
 
04:13:04.130 --> 04:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
director behind me I want to give her
 
04:13:05.689 --> 04:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
credit for this she put this together to
 
04:13:07.250 --> 04:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
try to answer those questions in advance
 
04:13:09.290 --> 04:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
so that when we do go through and we see
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
increases or reductions by each
 
04:13:13.250 --> 04:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
accounting unit and FTE we're able to
 
04:13:16.729 --> 04:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
track that so with no further Ado I will
 
04:13:20.110 --> 04:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
hand it over to Joe
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
great good afternoon everybody Joe rips
 
04:13:24.410 --> 04:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
I'm director dcif good to see you all
 
04:13:24.420 --> 04:13:25.729 align:start position:0%
I'm director dcif good to see you all
again

04:13:25.729 --> 04:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:13:25.739 --> 04:13:26.510 align:start position:0%
again
um

04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:28.849 --> 04:13:28.859 align:start position:0%
so I will start you know walking us
 
04:13:30.769 --> 04:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
through the presentation here I'm sure
 
04:13:33.229 --> 04:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
folks will have questions I'm at the
 
04:13:34.429 --> 04:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
discretion of the chair totally
 
04:13:36.170 --> 04:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
comfortable taking questions as we go
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
rather than waiting till the end
 
04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
um because I think that probably makes
 
04:13:41.570 --> 04:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
more sense for folks
 
04:13:44.210 --> 04:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
and you'll notice as you continue to go
 
04:13:46.370 --> 04:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
through these that the department tried
 
04:13:46.380 --> 04:13:47.450 align:start position:0%
through these that the department tried
to

04:13:47.450 --> 04:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
um create kind of a standardized format
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
for these presentations so you'll see I
 
04:13:54.170 --> 04:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
think some similarities in the way this
 
04:13:56.929 --> 04:13:56.939 align:start position:0%
is presented to the other divisions and
 
04:13:58.670 --> 04:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
probably some differences between how
 
04:13:59.929 --> 04:13:59.939 align:start position:0%
it's presented this year and how it was
 
04:14:02.090 --> 04:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
presented last year I'm sorry last
 
04:14:02.100 --> 04:14:03.650 align:start position:0%
presented last year I'm sorry last
biennium

04:14:03.650 --> 04:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
04:14:06.050 --> 04:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
so turn to page two this just is the the
 
04:14:08.210 --> 04:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
mission of the division and I'll move
 
04:14:09.229 --> 04:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
kind of quickly through this stuff
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
unless folks want me to go deeper we
 
04:14:12.830 --> 04:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
partner with families and communities
 
04:14:14.630 --> 04:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
provide resources and supports that lead
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
to the safety and healthy development of
 
04:14:18.830 --> 04:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
children youth and the communities in
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
which they thrive in which they live
 
04:14:22.849 --> 04:14:22.859 align:start position:0%
and then the next page kind of just
 
04:14:25.670 --> 04:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
talks about what the key page three
 
04:14:27.229 --> 04:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
talks about what kind of the key areas
 
04:14:31.790 --> 04:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
of focus dcyf has so dcyf really has
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
three key responsibilities Child
 
04:14:36.710 --> 04:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
Protective Services Juvenile Justice
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
Services and then the operation of sysc
 
04:14:40.910 --> 04:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
which this committee has spent a lot of
 
04:14:43.550 --> 04:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
time talking about already
 
04:14:45.170 --> 04:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
um almost everything else we do is just
 
04:14:46.729 --> 04:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
in service to better supporting those
 
04:14:47.870 --> 04:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
things you'll see we have multiple
 
04:14:49.610 --> 04:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
bureaus as I get through that but what
 
04:14:51.170 --> 04:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
those bureaus primarily do is provide
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
the back office support to make sure
 
04:14:54.349 --> 04:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
that those things that we do in the
 
04:14:56.210 --> 04:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
community through these my three kind of
 
04:14:58.189 --> 04:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
main operations
 
04:15:00.110 --> 04:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
um are functioning well so child
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
protective services this is
 
04:15:03.769 --> 04:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
investigating and assessing allegations
 
04:15:06.050 --> 04:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
of child abuse and neglect providing for
 
04:15:07.849 --> 04:15:07.859 align:start position:0%
the safety permanency and well-being of
 
04:15:09.590 --> 04:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
child victims or children at risk of
 
04:15:09.600 --> 04:15:10.729 align:start position:0%
child victims or children at risk of
maltreatment

04:15:10.729 --> 04:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
maltreatment
 
04:15:13.070 --> 04:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
so we get um and I'll go through this
 
04:15:14.330 --> 04:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
with the data but essentially the way
 
04:15:16.670 --> 04:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
Child Protection Services works we get
 
04:15:18.769 --> 04:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
calls to our child protection hotline
 
04:15:21.830 --> 04:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
make allegations of things that may or
 
04:15:23.929 --> 04:15:23.939 align:start position:0%
may not have happened at the hotline
 
04:15:26.150 --> 04:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
folks do an assessment either screen in
 
04:15:28.010 --> 04:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
or screen out or make a referral for
 
04:15:29.689 --> 04:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
some alternative service and I'll go
 
04:15:31.729 --> 04:15:31.739 align:start position:0%
deeper into some of this later if things
 
04:15:33.469 --> 04:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
get screened out they get assigned for
 
04:15:35.870 --> 04:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
an assessment or an investigation and
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
during that process staff are doing two
 
04:15:39.410 --> 04:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
different things one they're assessing
 
04:15:41.150 --> 04:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not abuse or neglect has
 
04:15:43.370 --> 04:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
occurred is defined by law and
 
04:15:45.229 --> 04:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
separately they're assessing kind of the
 
04:15:47.510 --> 04:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
the needs and risk profile of the family
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
using an Actuarial tool and based on
 
04:15:51.050 --> 04:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
what comes back from that information
 
04:15:53.269 --> 04:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
we'll then determine if we'll move
 
04:15:55.550 --> 04:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
forward with potentially a court case in
 
04:15:57.110 --> 04:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
rare instances a child being removed
 
04:15:58.429 --> 04:15:58.439 align:start position:0%
from their home that is actually quite
 
04:15:59.990 --> 04:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
rare right we do over ten thousand
 
04:16:02.269 --> 04:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
assessments a year removals are counted
 
04:16:03.769 --> 04:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
in the hundreds right so people often
 
04:16:05.330 --> 04:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
think that this is a system that removes
 
04:16:07.010 --> 04:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
children pretty regularly it's actually
 
04:16:08.570 --> 04:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
a pretty rare instance that children get
 
04:16:08.580 --> 04:16:10.250 align:start position:0%
a pretty rare instance that children get
removed

04:16:10.250 --> 04:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
removed
 
04:16:12.170 --> 04:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
um what happens more often than not is a
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
family is offered some type of services
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
either within the system or made a
 
04:16:18.050 --> 04:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
referral to something outside of the
 
04:16:20.389 --> 04:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
child protection system
 
04:16:22.610 --> 04:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
the next section here is Juvenile
 
04:16:24.170 --> 04:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
Justice Services support Children and
 
04:16:25.790 --> 04:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
Youth to remediate challenges with
 
04:16:27.769 --> 04:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
delinquency to promote child family and
 
04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
Community safety support Children and
 
04:16:31.189 --> 04:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
Youth identified as children in need of
 
04:16:31.199 --> 04:16:32.269 align:start position:0%
Youth identified as children in need of
services

04:16:32.269 --> 04:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:16:34.910 --> 04:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
so the typical pathway for Juvenile
 
04:16:36.950 --> 04:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
Justice case is a young person has
 
04:16:38.990 --> 04:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
contact with law enforcement
 
04:16:41.090 --> 04:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
law enforcement would then potentially
 
04:16:43.210 --> 04:16:43.220 align:start position:0%
file some type of petition
 
04:16:45.950 --> 04:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
and we would then you know if a petition
 
04:16:47.630 --> 04:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
is filed we get engaged at that point if
 
04:16:49.309 --> 04:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
the youth is put on probation or youth
 
04:16:51.050 --> 04:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
is sent to sysc were then engaged
 
04:16:53.330 --> 04:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
through those processes we did have a
 
04:16:55.490 --> 04:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
major change last year in this that I'll
 
04:16:56.990 --> 04:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
want to talk about in more depth as we
 
04:16:59.090 --> 04:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
get into this around a new process that
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
happens in juvenile justice that we call
 
04:17:02.990 --> 04:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
an assessment process whereas now when
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
law enforcement has contact with a young
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
person they then refer them to us to do
 
04:17:09.110 --> 04:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
a child adolescent needs and strengths
 
04:17:11.090 --> 04:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
assessment and we then use that
 
04:17:12.830 --> 04:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
assessment to make a recommendation back
 
04:17:14.450 --> 04:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
as to whether this child really needs
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
Court intervention or whether we can
 
04:17:17.150 --> 04:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of this child in the
 
04:17:19.370 --> 04:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
community and I have some data on how
 
04:17:20.750 --> 04:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
that new system is working it's been
 
04:17:22.250 --> 04:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
operational for only about a year at
 
04:17:23.809 --> 04:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
this point
 
04:17:25.550 --> 04:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
the last piece of your children in need
 
04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
of services
 
04:17:28.670 --> 04:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
that happens in a couple different ways
 
04:17:30.650 --> 04:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
there's what's called voluntary chins
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
children in need of services chins is
 
04:17:35.050 --> 04:17:35.060 align:start position:0%
how people refer to this that occurs
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
when a child is struggling sometimes in
 
04:17:38.809 --> 04:17:38.819 align:start position:0%
school or some other place and the
 
04:17:40.550 --> 04:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
family or the school is calling up for
 
04:17:42.050 --> 04:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
us to provide some additional support
 
04:17:44.510 --> 04:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
for that young person those voluntary
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
chins can only be in-home services they
 
04:17:48.590 --> 04:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
cannot be residential services and then
 
04:17:49.969 --> 04:17:49.979 align:start position:0%
there's something called
 
04:17:52.189 --> 04:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
which we refer to kind of a D2 chins or
 
04:17:55.309 --> 04:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
an involuntary chins that is where and
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
we see less and less of this thanks to
 
04:17:59.450 --> 04:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
the the new system of care that's been
 
04:18:01.550 --> 04:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
running for a few years now but that's
 
04:18:03.769 --> 04:18:03.779 align:start position:0%
where a family would go into court and
 
04:18:05.450 --> 04:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
have to make an allegation to a judge
 
04:18:07.490 --> 04:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
that their child is so out of control
 
04:18:09.050 --> 04:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
that they need the judge to put that
 
04:18:10.849 --> 04:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
child into residential treatment
 
04:18:13.550 --> 04:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
fortunately those happen less and less
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
today because the system of care has now
 
04:18:17.150 --> 04:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
offered an alternative pathway for those
 
04:18:19.010 --> 04:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
families to get help which is a great
 
04:18:21.050 --> 04:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
thing right imagine if you're the parent
 
04:18:23.210 --> 04:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
and you're trying to have this you know
 
04:18:25.849 --> 04:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
this care provided to your child and the
 
04:18:27.110 --> 04:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
only way you could do it is going to
 
04:18:28.490 --> 04:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
court and telling the court that your
 
04:18:29.689 --> 04:18:29.699 align:start position:0%
child is out of control and they're
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
dangerous that doesn't really lead to a
 
04:18:32.399 --> 04:18:33.189 align:start position:0%
dangerous that doesn't really lead to a
very

04:18:33.189 --> 04:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:18:35.150 --> 04:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
therapeutic productive relationship
 
04:18:36.830 --> 04:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
between the parent and child inclination
 
04:18:38.210 --> 04:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
the way that it needs to in order for
 
04:18:39.469 --> 04:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
that child to be able to safely come
 
04:18:40.969 --> 04:18:40.979 align:start position:0%
back to the community now with the
 
04:18:42.950 --> 04:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
system of care those kids can access
 
04:18:44.269 --> 04:18:44.279 align:start position:0%
that service through the new Care
 
04:18:45.650 --> 04:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
Management entities through the fast
 
04:18:48.050 --> 04:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
forward program and no longer have to go
 
04:18:49.969 --> 04:18:49.979 align:start position:0%
through that process so that's really a
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
great thing but this D2 chins process is
 
04:18:54.889 --> 04:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
still on the books and infrequently it
 
04:18:56.570 --> 04:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
is still used where we're not able to
 
04:18:59.929 --> 04:18:59.939 align:start position:0%
get a young person to voluntarily engage
 
04:19:01.189 --> 04:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
through the children's Behavioral Health
 
04:19:02.650 --> 04:19:02.660 align:start position:0%
Care system
 
04:19:05.570 --> 04:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
and then lastly sysc which we've spent a
 
04:19:06.830 --> 04:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
lot of time talking about over the last
 
04:19:08.570 --> 04:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
couple weeks but the purpose there
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
provide a safe and secure environment
 
04:19:11.510 --> 04:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
for detained and committed youth that
 
04:19:13.010 --> 04:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
receive Crisis Intervention mental
 
04:19:14.450 --> 04:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
health and treatment services in a
 
04:19:16.910 --> 04:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
secured setting ensure the safety and
 
04:19:18.290 --> 04:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
well-being of committed and detained
 
04:19:19.849 --> 04:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
Youth and the overall safety of the
 
04:19:23.689 --> 04:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
community what page does sysc start on
 
04:19:25.429 --> 04:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
well we mention it here on page three
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
but on in the actual powering point in
 
04:19:41.410 --> 04:19:41.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:46.510 --> 04:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:49.130 --> 04:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
and what's unusual there is I believe
 
04:19:52.849 --> 04:19:52.859 align:start position:0%
the actual sysc operating expenses are
 
04:19:58.510 --> 04:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:01.729 --> 04:20:01.739 align:start position:0%
which stems from last biennium's
 
04:20:01.739 --> 04:20:03.050 align:start position:0%
which stems from last biennium's
decision

04:20:03.050 --> 04:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:20:04.729 --> 04:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
um during the budget process that makes
 
04:20:07.130 --> 04:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
the budget to hb2
 
04:20:07.140 --> 04:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
the budget to hb2
yeah

04:20:07.380 --> 04:20:07.390 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:20:07.390 --> 04:20:08.870 align:start position:0%
yeah
[Music]

04:20:08.870 --> 04:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
it makes sense yeah so so that's why
 
04:20:14.030 --> 04:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at uh the the 24 and
 
04:20:17.990 --> 04:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:24.710 --> 04:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
keep going okay I'm going to move on to
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:34.309 --> 04:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
page four is just kind of the high level
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
organizational chart of the division
 
04:20:37.199 --> 04:20:38.150 align:start position:0%
organizational chart of the division
um

04:20:38.150 --> 04:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:40.010 --> 04:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
as I said kind of the the bulk of our
 
04:20:42.410 --> 04:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
work is child protection and Juvenile
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
Justice in the field and that falls
 
04:20:45.469 --> 04:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
under the second box here that says
 
04:20:47.150 --> 04:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
Field Services
 
04:20:48.590 --> 04:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
so all of our juvenile probation
 
04:20:50.990 --> 04:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
officers all of our cpsws all of our
 
04:20:53.150 --> 04:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
district offices they all fall into this
 
04:20:56.210 --> 04:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
this operation as field services and
 
04:20:58.010 --> 04:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
then sysc which we're all familiar with
 
04:20:59.750 --> 04:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
everything else here is really in
 
04:21:01.070 --> 04:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
support to making sure that those two
 
04:21:03.290 --> 04:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
things can work well so so if I wanted
 
04:21:05.090 --> 04:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
to look at the budget where it says
 
04:21:07.429 --> 04:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
Personnel for Field Services what page
 
04:21:10.849 --> 04:21:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:10.859 --> 04:21:12.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:14.689 --> 04:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen is is we're going
 
04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
to go to key challenges next and then
 
04:21:19.790 --> 04:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
and then beginning on slide seven
 
04:21:21.889 --> 04:21:21.899 align:start position:0%
um we have all of the accounting units
 
04:21:24.349 --> 04:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
listed for each Bureau area and then
 
04:21:26.090 --> 04:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to go through those in in
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:29.760 --> 04:21:32.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:21:32.450 --> 04:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:34.849 --> 04:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
so the other primary
 
04:21:38.689 --> 04:21:38.699 align:start position:0%
um operations within dcyf is our office
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
of Chief our chief of legal Regulatory
 
04:21:43.809 --> 04:21:43.819 align:start position:0%
and legislative affairs who
 
04:21:45.889 --> 04:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
interacts here with the legislature
 
04:21:47.269 --> 04:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
provides general counsel to the
 
04:21:48.650 --> 04:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
department oversees our policy
 
04:21:50.290 --> 04:21:50.300 align:start position:0%
operations and a handful of other
 
04:21:52.130 --> 04:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
regulatory development and things like
 
04:21:54.290 --> 04:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
that our chief of operations who
 
04:21:55.790 --> 04:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
oversees our Bureau of professional
 
04:21:58.250 --> 04:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
strategic development our Bureau of
 
04:21:59.809 --> 04:21:59.819 align:start position:0%
evaluation analytics and Reporting on
 
04:22:01.490 --> 04:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
our business Information Systems all of
 
04:22:02.809 --> 04:22:02.819 align:start position:0%
these are going to be gone into a little
 
04:22:04.010 --> 04:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
bit deeper this is just the high level
 
04:22:05.650 --> 04:22:05.660 align:start position:0%
to orient you
 
04:22:07.969 --> 04:22:07.979 align:start position:0%
our Bureau of community family and
 
04:22:09.650 --> 04:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
program support reports directly to
 
04:22:10.610 --> 04:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
Maine not through the chief of
 
04:22:12.290 --> 04:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
operations and that's the bureau that's
 
04:22:14.090 --> 04:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
really responsible for all of our
 
04:22:15.769 --> 04:22:15.779 align:start position:0%
services in the community all of our
 
04:22:17.269 --> 04:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
contracts for services all of our
 
04:22:19.370 --> 04:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
procurements for services they also
 
04:22:21.410 --> 04:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
oversee specialty areas like foster care
 
04:22:24.290 --> 04:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
adoption and things like that our youth
 
04:22:26.210 --> 04:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
our youth work our youth aging out of
 
04:22:28.309 --> 04:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
foster care work the Hope program which
 
04:22:30.530 --> 04:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
is voluntary foster care to age 21 which
 
04:22:32.510 --> 04:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
I can go into deeper later and then
 
04:22:34.670 --> 04:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
finally sysc which folks are familiar
 
04:22:34.680 --> 04:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
finally sysc which folks are familiar
with

04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
so page five no
 
04:22:46.550 --> 04:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
page five lays out uh kind of what we
 
04:22:48.110 --> 04:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
see as key accomplishments of the last
 
04:22:48.120 --> 04:22:50.030 align:start position:0%
see as key accomplishments of the last
biennium

04:22:50.030 --> 04:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
04:22:51.650 --> 04:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
and I broke these up into a couple
 
04:22:54.290 --> 04:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
different ways I'm one right this idea
 
04:22:55.969 --> 04:22:55.979 align:start position:0%
providing earlier supports that support
 
04:22:58.969 --> 04:22:58.979 align:start position:0%
children and strengthen families
 
04:22:58.979 --> 04:23:00.590 align:start position:0%
children and strengthen families
um

04:23:00.590 --> 04:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:02.030 --> 04:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
one of the key things that we're working
 
04:23:04.610 --> 04:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
on right now is a new procurement which
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
we're in final negotiations on for
 
04:23:07.969 --> 04:23:07.979 align:start position:0%
something called a community navigator
 
04:23:10.130 --> 04:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
at Child Protection intake that's been
 
04:23:12.170 --> 04:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
procured and is currently in negotiation
 
04:23:14.750 --> 04:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
what the community Navigator is is when
 
04:23:16.849 --> 04:23:16.859 align:start position:0%
somebody calls the hotline for child
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect and they make a
 
04:23:19.870 --> 04:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
they're making an allegation
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
historically we only had two options to
 
04:23:23.450 --> 04:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
offer that person either you're
 
04:23:24.590 --> 04:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
screening in and you're doing an
 
04:23:26.210 --> 04:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
investigation or you're screening out
 
04:23:28.250 --> 04:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
now we have a third option that's going
 
04:23:30.170 --> 04:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
to be available which is that we can
 
04:23:31.849 --> 04:23:31.859 align:start position:0%
then try to help connect that family to
 
04:23:33.710 --> 04:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
services so it's not uncommon at all
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
that we'll get a call to the hotline
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
where it doesn't it doesn't allege abuse
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
or neglect but there's clearly a need
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
for a family simple idea
 
04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
Teacher Calls because a child's coming
 
04:23:45.410 --> 04:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
to school without adequate breakfast in
 
04:23:46.309 --> 04:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
the morning
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's not really abuse or neglect
 
04:23:49.550 --> 04:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
typically what that typically is an
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
issue around poverty or an issue around
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
access to food security so in that
 
04:23:55.070 --> 04:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
instance the community Navigator could
 
04:23:56.450 --> 04:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
then work with that teacher to help that
 
04:23:57.889 --> 04:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
teacher figure out how do you get that
 
04:23:59.510 --> 04:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
family to the help that they need
 
04:24:01.250 --> 04:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
without having to have child protection
 
04:24:02.809 --> 04:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
go out and get involved in that family
 
04:24:02.819 --> 04:24:04.790 align:start position:0%
go out and get involved in that family
unnecessarily

04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
next big thing here community-based
 
04:24:08.990 --> 04:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary services this was a big deal a
 
04:24:10.570 --> 04:24:10.580 align:start position:0%
few years ago
 
04:24:14.030 --> 04:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
just four or five years ago before I got
 
04:24:16.670 --> 04:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
here and up until a year afterwards as a
 
04:24:18.290 --> 04:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
matter of law we were not allowed to
 
04:24:19.910 --> 04:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
provide a voluntary service to a family
 
04:24:22.010 --> 04:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
a family would come to our attention
 
04:24:25.490 --> 04:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
we'd conduct an assessment we would say
 
04:24:27.229 --> 04:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
it's not abuse or neglect but there's a
 
04:24:28.610 --> 04:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
whole lot of needs here
 
04:24:30.110 --> 04:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
there's high risk here we use an
 
04:24:32.150 --> 04:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
Actuarial tool that identifies whether
 
04:24:34.189 --> 04:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
there's risk in families but we wouldn't
 
04:24:35.630 --> 04:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
actually have the authority to provide
 
04:24:37.309 --> 04:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
any type of service to help support that
 
04:24:39.950 --> 04:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
family that was changed a few years ago
 
04:24:41.150 --> 04:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
in law and now we have a couple
 
04:24:42.590 --> 04:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
different Pathways what we call
 
04:24:44.030 --> 04:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
Community for what we call voluntary
 
04:24:45.530 --> 04:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
services that is the ability to work
 
04:24:47.689 --> 04:24:47.699 align:start position:0%
with the family on a voluntary basis
 
04:24:49.550 --> 04:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
One Is Us opening up our own voluntary
 
04:24:51.410 --> 04:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
case there's only a handful of those a
 
04:24:52.910 --> 04:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
year because of caseload issues and
 
04:24:54.110 --> 04:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
other things it's tough to open up too
 
04:24:55.910 --> 04:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
many of those the other is this new
 
04:24:57.590 --> 04:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
model called community-based voluntary
 
04:24:59.330 --> 04:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
Services where we contract with two
 
04:25:01.969 --> 04:25:01.979 align:start position:0%
major providers Waypoint for most of the
 
04:25:03.769 --> 04:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
state and the Family Resource Center
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
Center at Gorham for the North country
 
04:25:08.689 --> 04:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
so when we do an assessment we will
 
04:25:10.610 --> 04:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
identify that this is a family that has
 
04:25:12.769 --> 04:25:12.779 align:start position:0%
some needs that we're not going to be
 
04:25:14.570 --> 04:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
able to meet because right we're not
 
04:25:16.010 --> 04:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
opening up our own case we're not going
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
to court with this and that provider
 
04:25:19.429 --> 04:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
will then voluntarily work with that
 
04:25:20.870 --> 04:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
family to try to meet those needs
 
04:25:22.670 --> 04:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
identify what's going on strengthen that
 
04:25:24.050 --> 04:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
family and hopefully keep that family
 
04:25:26.450 --> 04:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
from coming back to us repeatedly as
 
04:25:28.969 --> 04:25:28.979 align:start position:0%
historically happened
 
04:25:31.070 --> 04:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
next big accomplishment here is the JJ
 
04:25:32.750 --> 04:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
assessment process which was Senate Bill
 
04:25:35.570 --> 04:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
94 from 2021 this is the one I talked
 
04:25:36.769 --> 04:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
about a little while ago and now
 
04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
implemented straight Statewide this is
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
when kids have contact with law
 
04:25:42.170 --> 04:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
enforcement they get referred to us and
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
we then conduct a cans child adolescent
 
04:25:47.330 --> 04:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
needs and strengths tool and use that to
 
04:25:49.070 --> 04:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
identify whether this is a young person
 
04:25:50.389 --> 04:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
who has needs that can be met in the
 
04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
community or these needs that really
 
04:25:54.349 --> 04:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
need to go to court and as I'll go
 
04:25:55.309 --> 04:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
through the data a little bit later
 
04:25:57.590 --> 04:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see overwhelmingly we've been
 
04:25:59.450 --> 04:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
able to identify young people and keep
 
04:26:01.670 --> 04:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
them out of the court process and send
 
04:26:03.649 --> 04:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
them on to community-based services to
 
04:26:05.030 --> 04:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
meet their needs instead of going to
 
04:26:07.490 --> 04:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
court last year which was the first year
 
04:26:09.530 --> 04:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
that we did this it started in January
 
04:26:11.889 --> 04:26:11.899 align:start position:0%
of last year in one third of the state
 
04:26:14.090 --> 04:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
July of last year went to the next third
 
04:26:15.950 --> 04:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
of the state October of last year went
 
04:26:17.689 --> 04:26:17.699 align:start position:0%
Statewide and last year we were able to
 
04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
conduct a little over a thousand
 
04:26:20.750 --> 04:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
assessments I do anticipate next year is
 
04:26:22.729 --> 04:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
going to be higher because it won't be a
 
04:26:24.229 --> 04:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
rolling implementation anymore it's just
 
04:26:25.490 --> 04:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
going to be the normal way that we do
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
business and there's data in here that
 
04:26:28.189 --> 04:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
talks about that a little bit more
 
04:26:28.199 --> 04:26:30.410 align:start position:0%
talks about that a little bit more
deeply

04:26:30.410 --> 04:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
deeply
 
04:26:33.110 --> 04:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
um next big thing here I talk about is
 
04:26:34.729 --> 04:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
the kinship Navigator programs which we
 
04:26:36.889 --> 04:26:36.899 align:start position:0%
stood up a few years ago in partnership
 
04:26:38.809 --> 04:26:38.819 align:start position:0%
with public health and with division of
 
04:26:40.870 --> 04:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
Economic and housing stability
 
04:26:43.570 --> 04:26:43.580 align:start position:0%
those are programs for
 
04:26:46.610 --> 04:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
grandparents Aunts Uncles anybody who is
 
04:26:48.429 --> 04:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
caring for a young person
 
04:26:50.809 --> 04:26:50.819 align:start position:0%
because of needs in that family outside
 
04:26:53.630 --> 04:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
of the formal child protection system so
 
04:26:55.610 --> 04:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
we often have kids come into foster care
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
but it's also very very common for young
 
04:26:59.990 --> 04:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
people to end up living with a
 
04:27:02.330 --> 04:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
grandmother without us being involved or
 
04:27:03.769 --> 04:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
living with an aunt or uncle or some
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
other person who cares for them without
 
04:27:09.469 --> 04:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:12.590 --> 04:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
of these four four bullets here under
 
04:27:15.490 --> 04:27:15.500 align:start position:0%
providing earlier supports
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
are all of these completely voluntary on
 
04:27:21.070 --> 04:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
the part of the family is there any
 
04:27:23.809 --> 04:27:23.819 align:start position:0%
coercion or compulsion in any of these
 
04:27:26.170 --> 04:27:26.180 align:start position:0%
no it's all completely voluntary
 
04:27:28.610 --> 04:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
families don't have to participate in
 
04:27:30.170 --> 04:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
any of these things so really it's a
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's a way of doing business which you
 
04:27:33.649 --> 04:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
know we think is going to be much more
 
04:27:35.330 --> 04:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
successful with families getting them
 
04:27:37.309 --> 04:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
the help that they need based on their
 
04:27:39.830 --> 04:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
desire to engage as opposed to thank you
 
04:27:42.349 --> 04:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
right when you have core involvement
 
04:27:44.210 --> 04:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
so this last program can ship a
 
04:27:46.010 --> 04:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
navigation though has been really huge
 
04:27:48.590 --> 04:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
in getting kids and families
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
um who are you know folks who are living
 
04:27:51.410 --> 04:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
with these grandparents and others the
 
04:27:53.450 --> 04:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
support that they need in order to try
 
04:27:55.010 --> 04:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
to help them you know navigate the
 
04:27:56.750 --> 04:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
benefit system if they qualify for TANF
 
04:27:58.370 --> 04:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
benefits Med navigate the court
 
04:27:59.570 --> 04:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
processes if they need to get
 
04:28:01.670 --> 04:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
guardianship for a young person help
 
04:28:03.410 --> 04:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
them through the school process help
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
them deal with the changing
 
04:28:06.710 --> 04:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
relationships that they're experiencing
 
04:28:07.910 --> 04:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
right you can imagine if you're a
 
04:28:09.889 --> 04:28:09.899 align:start position:0%
grandparent and all of a sudden you're
 
04:28:11.510 --> 04:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
caring for your grandchild as your own
 
04:28:13.490 --> 04:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
child that might put a strain on your
 
04:28:15.410 --> 04:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
relationship with your with your child
 
04:28:17.389 --> 04:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
of course right that's a different way
 
04:28:19.010 --> 04:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
of having to work with those folks and
 
04:28:21.290 --> 04:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
these Community these kinship navigation
 
04:28:24.110 --> 04:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
programs really help those folks manage
 
04:28:25.429 --> 04:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
these change Dynamics so they can
 
04:28:26.929 --> 04:28:26.939 align:start position:0%
provide care for their for their
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
grandchildren or other relatives or you
 
04:28:31.490 --> 04:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
know whatever that structure is within
 
04:28:33.469 --> 04:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
the family
 
04:28:35.510 --> 04:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
next big bucket here talking about
 
04:28:37.309 --> 04:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
higher quality supports when formal
 
04:28:39.170 --> 04:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
system involvement is required so
 
04:28:40.429 --> 04:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
everything I just spoke about there was
 
04:28:41.990 --> 04:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
really ways that we're trying to get to
 
04:28:44.030 --> 04:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
families before formal systems
 
04:28:46.370 --> 04:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
involvement or if they touch the formal
 
04:28:47.870 --> 04:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
system to try to divert them away from
 
04:28:49.790 --> 04:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
the formal system into community-based
 
04:28:49.800 --> 04:28:50.929 align:start position:0%
the formal system into community-based
supports

04:28:50.929 --> 04:28:50.939 align:start position:0%
supports
 
04:28:52.429 --> 04:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
the next big area that we've been
 
04:28:53.929 --> 04:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
working on is how do we improve for
 
04:28:55.309 --> 04:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
those handful of families that do need
 
04:28:57.469 --> 04:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
to formally come into the system
 
04:28:59.389 --> 04:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
um one big piece of this is the federal
 
04:29:01.189 --> 04:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
Family First preventative Services act
 
04:29:02.929 --> 04:29:02.939 align:start position:0%
prevention plan which we had approved by
 
04:29:05.750 --> 04:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
the feds in October of 2022 family first
 
04:29:08.030 --> 04:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
made really two big changes in federal
 
04:29:09.769 --> 04:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
law in the way that we have to operate
 
04:29:12.530 --> 04:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
our systems one for residential care put
 
04:29:14.149 --> 04:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
in a bunch of new requirements that
 
04:29:16.010 --> 04:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
we've operationalized through the Bureau
 
04:29:17.450 --> 04:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
of children's Behavioral Health they'll
 
04:29:20.330 --> 04:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
go into more depth about that but we
 
04:29:21.830 --> 04:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit at prior hearings
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
about the new contract process we went
 
04:29:25.189 --> 04:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
through there the new requirements on
 
04:29:26.809 --> 04:29:26.819 align:start position:0%
those programs that is all stuff that's
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
aligned with family first the new cat
 
04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
assessments that we talked about all of
 
04:29:31.969 --> 04:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
that stuff is part of the family first
 
04:29:34.429 --> 04:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
requirements for residential care the
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
other piece is that it allowed the
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
states to start to draw down federal
 
04:29:40.070 --> 04:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
funds to help support programs for
 
04:29:41.750 --> 04:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
families who are at risk of having their
 
04:29:44.149 --> 04:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
kids enter foster care and that's a
 
04:29:45.469 --> 04:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
somewhat more narrow definition than
 
04:29:46.910 --> 04:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
some people think some people thought
 
04:29:48.649 --> 04:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
that meant basically any family could
 
04:29:50.450 --> 04:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
receive these Services that's not the
 
04:29:52.490 --> 04:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
way the feds have defined it it really
 
04:29:54.649 --> 04:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
is families who come to our attention
 
04:29:55.790 --> 04:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
through say a child protection
 
04:29:57.950 --> 04:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
assessment we make a determination that
 
04:29:59.570 --> 04:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
they're at risk of entering foster care
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
as a result of that but if we put in XYZ
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
service we can keep those kids safe at
 
04:30:06.710 --> 04:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
home and then the feds will allow us to
 
04:30:08.750 --> 04:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
we'll reimburse us for part of the cost
 
04:30:11.090 --> 04:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
of evidence-based models that meet their
 
04:30:12.590 --> 04:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
criteria and they created an
 
04:30:13.910 --> 04:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
evidence-based Clearinghouse and
 
04:30:15.469 --> 04:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
identified which program models and
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
stuff that we could use we've
 
04:30:18.830 --> 04:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
implemented two and are in the process
 
04:30:20.510 --> 04:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
of implementing our third evidence-based
 
04:30:22.070 --> 04:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
program in the past couple years based
 
04:30:24.050 --> 04:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
off of this the first was multi-systemic
 
04:30:25.969 --> 04:30:25.979 align:start position:0%
therapy which is a program really
 
04:30:28.849 --> 04:30:28.859 align:start position:0%
targeted for those adolescents who
 
04:30:30.290 --> 04:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
typically folks would think of as having
 
04:30:31.670 --> 04:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know quote unquote Behavior
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
challenges that works closely and deeply
 
04:30:35.630 --> 04:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
with the family and the young person
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
around kind of stabilizing the home
 
04:30:39.769 --> 04:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
environment helping the the family unit
 
04:30:41.090 --> 04:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
understand how to manage The Young
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
Person's behaviors and helping the
 
04:30:45.530 --> 04:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
family then shape and and remold The
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
Young Person's behaviors towards things
 
04:30:49.610 --> 04:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
that we that we want Young Folks to do
 
04:30:51.410 --> 04:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
the next is one called Youth Villages
 
04:30:53.870 --> 04:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
intercept which has been procured in and
 
04:30:56.330 --> 04:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
implemented that one is a program that's
 
04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
more for use on the child protection
 
04:30:59.809 --> 04:30:59.819 align:start position:0%
side of the house focuses more on the
 
04:31:02.450 --> 04:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
parental supports necessary for families
 
04:31:04.250 --> 04:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
who are struggling with you know keeping
 
04:31:05.630 --> 04:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
their kids safe and doing the things
 
04:31:06.649 --> 04:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
that they need to do for their children
 
04:31:09.170 --> 04:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
Works closely with those families around
 
04:31:11.269 --> 04:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
those challenges and then the final one
 
04:31:12.830 --> 04:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
is the Healthy Families America program
 
04:31:15.530 --> 04:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
we procured that last summer in
 
04:31:17.929 --> 04:31:17.939 align:start position:0%
partnership with public health and that
 
04:31:20.410 --> 04:31:20.420 align:start position:0%
is a home visitation program
 
04:31:23.149 --> 04:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
the historical model only allowed them
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
to work with folks if they engaged in
 
04:31:26.630 --> 04:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
the program before the child was two
 
04:31:29.090 --> 04:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
weeks old you can imagine for our
 
04:31:31.309 --> 04:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
population trying to get to a child and
 
04:31:32.990 --> 04:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
getting a family engaged before a child
 
04:31:35.750 --> 04:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
is two weeks old is pretty difficult
 
04:31:37.670 --> 04:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
um so there is a there's a newer model
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
called the Child Welfare protocols that
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
have been approved under the family
 
04:31:42.590 --> 04:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
first Clearinghouse which allows you to
 
04:31:44.990 --> 04:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
to open up a program for a child up to
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
24 months old so we have actually a lot
 
04:31:49.010 --> 04:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
of families who would qualify for that
 
04:31:50.929 --> 04:31:50.939 align:start position:0%
program and that would then put a home
 
04:31:53.870 --> 04:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
visitor in to work with families who are
 
04:31:55.729 --> 04:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
at you know high risk oftentimes the
 
04:31:57.710 --> 04:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
families who benefit for this benefit
 
04:31:59.210 --> 04:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
from this are you know kids who are
 
04:32:01.490 --> 04:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
maybe born with substance exposure or
 
04:32:02.750 --> 04:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
kids who are born with other types of
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
challenges that are identified even at
 
04:32:05.750 --> 04:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
the moment of birth in the hospital and
 
04:32:06.889 --> 04:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
then we start working with the family
 
04:32:09.110 --> 04:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
and trying to put services in place to
 
04:32:11.450 --> 04:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
keep that family together
 
04:32:14.149 --> 04:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
other key um accomplishments that I
 
04:32:15.530 --> 04:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
would point to around this higher
 
04:32:17.210 --> 04:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
quality supports is the work with
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health on building
 
04:32:21.410 --> 04:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
out that system of care things like fast
 
04:32:22.790 --> 04:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
forward and track that we spoke about
 
04:32:25.130 --> 04:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
extensively over the past couple weeks
 
04:32:27.050 --> 04:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
things like the residential redesign and
 
04:32:28.250 --> 04:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
the cat assessments that we spoke about
 
04:32:30.290 --> 04:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
over the past couple weeks we've really
 
04:32:31.969 --> 04:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
built this system to be integrated with
 
04:32:33.889 --> 04:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
dcyf Juvenile Justice and child
 
04:32:35.330 --> 04:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
protection and not just being a
 
04:32:36.889 --> 04:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
standalone system but rather whenever
 
04:32:38.570 --> 04:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
kids have Behavioral Health Care needs
 
04:32:40.849 --> 04:32:40.859 align:start position:0%
we want them going there rather than
 
04:32:42.469 --> 04:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
coming to us to have those needs met
 
04:32:44.450 --> 04:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
because if they're with children's
 
04:32:46.490 --> 04:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health they can continue to
 
04:32:47.929 --> 04:32:47.939 align:start position:0%
have their needs met after we're done
 
04:32:49.729 --> 04:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
right child protection
 
04:32:51.530 --> 04:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
right that's about kids it's about
 
04:32:53.689 --> 04:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
keeping family about families it's about
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
what's happening in that household and
 
04:32:57.110 --> 04:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
parents Juvenile Justice it's about
 
04:32:59.149 --> 04:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
delinquency children's Behavioral Health
 
04:33:02.090 --> 04:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
happens throughout all of these but if
 
04:33:03.590 --> 04:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
we end up becoming the system that has
 
04:33:04.910 --> 04:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
to provide children's Behavioral Health
 
04:33:06.590 --> 04:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
Care then families have to stay engaged
 
04:33:08.810 --> 04:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
with us longer than necessary right we
 
04:33:10.250 --> 04:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
want to be able to close out our case as
 
04:33:11.150 --> 04:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
soon as we deal with the child
 
04:33:13.010 --> 04:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
protection issue but if that kid has a
 
04:33:14.330 --> 04:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
behavioral health need the system of
 
04:33:16.189 --> 04:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
care is still there closeout or
 
04:33:17.689 --> 04:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
delinquency case on the Juvenile Justice
 
04:33:19.369 --> 04:33:19.379 align:start position:0%
side as soon as that issue is resolved
 
04:33:21.170 --> 04:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
but if that kid has ongoing Behavioral
 
04:33:22.789 --> 04:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
Health Care needs the system of care is
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
still there historically that's not how
 
04:33:26.269 --> 04:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
the systems have worked historically
 
04:33:27.529 --> 04:33:27.539 align:start position:0%
we've had to keep cases open
 
04:33:29.209 --> 04:33:29.219 align:start position:0%
indefinitely just to provide these
 
04:33:30.709 --> 04:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
Services for Families and now we don't
 
04:33:34.369 --> 04:33:34.379 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:36.109 --> 04:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
um next key accomplishment this is a
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
statute that passed last year and we're
 
04:33:39.590 --> 04:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
in the process of a major procurement on
 
04:33:41.209 --> 04:33:41.219 align:start position:0%
this which is a kinship care expansion
 
04:33:43.189 --> 04:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
so we talked a little bit while ago
 
04:33:44.869 --> 04:33:44.879 align:start position:0%
about the kinship Navigator programs
 
04:33:47.689 --> 04:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
another key place that you use kin and
 
04:33:49.070 --> 04:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
that is anybody who really has a
 
04:33:50.570 --> 04:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
pre-existing loving caring relationship
 
04:33:51.769 --> 04:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
with a child and who would be an
 
04:33:53.869 --> 04:33:53.879 align:start position:0%
appropriate caregiver is in the actual
 
04:33:55.609 --> 04:33:55.619 align:start position:0%
foster care system so if a child does
 
04:33:57.769 --> 04:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
have to come into our custody the best
 
04:33:59.209 --> 04:33:59.219 align:start position:0%
thing that we want to do is identify
 
04:34:00.890 --> 04:34:00.900 align:start position:0%
someone who already knows and loves that
 
04:34:02.810 --> 04:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
child and keep that child with that
 
04:34:04.429 --> 04:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
person right whether that's grand mom
 
04:34:06.650 --> 04:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
whether that's Aunt or Uncle whether
 
04:34:08.269 --> 04:34:08.279 align:start position:0%
that's the neighbor who's been involved
 
04:34:10.310 --> 04:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
in this kid's life forever whatever it
 
04:34:11.449 --> 04:34:11.459 align:start position:0%
is whether it's a member of the faith
 
04:34:13.369 --> 04:34:13.379 align:start position:0%
community we want to think of these
 
04:34:15.051 --> 04:34:15.061 align:start position:0%
things broadly obviously relatives are
 
04:34:16.730 --> 04:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
the most common but they're not the only
 
04:34:19.131 --> 04:34:19.141 align:start position:0%
type and law was changed last year to
 
04:34:20.631 --> 04:34:20.641 align:start position:0%
allow us to think more broadly about
 
04:34:22.730 --> 04:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
these kinship providers to include these
 
04:34:24.890 --> 04:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
other types of folks and we're in the
 
04:34:26.810 --> 04:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
process of we've already procured we're
 
04:34:28.609 --> 04:34:28.619 align:start position:0%
in the negotiation process with a vendor
 
04:34:30.109 --> 04:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
to provide additional support for these
 
04:34:31.670 --> 04:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
folks and to be able to actually license
 
04:34:34.070 --> 04:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
these folks as a special type of kinship
 
04:34:35.269 --> 04:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
foster parent
 
04:34:36.890 --> 04:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
which will provide them additional
 
04:34:38.689 --> 04:34:38.699 align:start position:0%
support training in a way that we
 
04:34:40.250 --> 04:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to do before and the
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
hopes of this is that by providing this
 
04:34:43.551 --> 04:34:43.561 align:start position:0%
additional supports and training we'll
 
04:34:44.810 --> 04:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
be able to increase the number of kids
 
04:34:46.970 --> 04:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
in kinship care which is good for the
 
04:34:49.010 --> 04:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
kid it's less trauma
 
04:34:50.929 --> 04:34:50.939 align:start position:0%
tend to have shorter lengths of stay in
 
04:34:52.189 --> 04:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
foster care when you're working with Ken
 
04:34:54.109 --> 04:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
even if that child reunifies they tend
 
04:34:55.849 --> 04:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
to reunify back home with their parents
 
04:34:57.170 --> 04:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
and they've built a support system with
 
04:34:59.150 --> 04:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
that caregiver whether it's Grandma or
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
whomever else
 
04:35:02.449 --> 04:35:02.459 align:start position:0%
but it's also really good because we
 
04:35:04.310 --> 04:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
have real challenges right now around
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
finding placements for young people
 
04:35:08.449 --> 04:35:08.459 align:start position:0%
entering foster care right the number of
 
04:35:10.010 --> 04:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
foster homes is kind of diminished or
 
04:35:12.769 --> 04:35:12.779 align:start position:0%
decreased During the covid period we've
 
04:35:14.929 --> 04:35:14.939 align:start position:0%
also had real challenges around
 
04:35:16.670 --> 04:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
Residential Care as we've spoken about
 
04:35:16.680 --> 04:35:17.510 align:start position:0%
Residential Care as we've spoken about
here

04:35:17.510 --> 04:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:35:19.551 --> 04:35:19.561 align:start position:0%
so by increasing the number of kids with
 
04:35:21.470 --> 04:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
kin we can decrease the pressures on
 
04:35:22.730 --> 04:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
those other parts of the system that are
 
04:35:24.890 --> 04:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
really struggling to keep up as I recall
 
04:35:28.730 --> 04:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
the foster parent program was under a
 
04:35:30.830 --> 04:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
lot of stress before the pandemic that
 
04:35:33.470 --> 04:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
we were seeing declining interest in the
 
04:35:36.289 --> 04:35:36.299 align:start position:0%
Foster program on the part of host
 
04:35:39.109 --> 04:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
families prior to the pandemic I don't I
 
04:35:40.730 --> 04:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
don't think the data supports it I think
 
04:35:42.590 --> 04:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
what we really saw was when the pandemic
 
04:35:44.689 --> 04:35:44.699 align:start position:0%
hit the recruitment levels come down and
 
04:35:46.189 --> 04:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
I can I can go back and pull the old
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
data books on that but
 
04:35:50.631 --> 04:35:50.641 align:start position:0%
the the number of licensed foster
 
04:35:52.429 --> 04:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
parents really was steadily increasing
 
04:35:57.769 --> 04:35:57.779 align:start position:0%
from about 20 17 18 19 and then really
 
04:36:00.289 --> 04:36:00.299 align:start position:0%
took a hit during the pandemic
 
04:36:03.230 --> 04:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
so but currently we think we have an
 
04:36:06.410 --> 04:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
inadequate supply of foster parents I
 
04:36:10.490 --> 04:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
yes I think right now 20 more 50 more
 
04:36:14.750 --> 04:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
100 what do you oh I would say probably
 
04:36:16.910 --> 04:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
I would like to see 50 more you know
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
what you want to see is do you want to
 
04:36:19.849 --> 04:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
have enough foster homes available so
 
04:36:21.170 --> 04:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
there are multiple options in every
 
04:36:22.970 --> 04:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
Community for every kid
 
04:36:25.250 --> 04:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
that being said there's multiple ways to
 
04:36:26.990 --> 04:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
get to that problem right one way is
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
about recruiting foster parents but
 
04:36:30.109 --> 04:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
another key way is about increasing
 
04:36:32.029 --> 04:36:32.039 align:start position:0%
kinship care which is probably the
 
04:36:33.769 --> 04:36:33.779 align:start position:0%
preferred option for all kids right if
 
04:36:35.689 --> 04:36:35.699 align:start position:0%
you have an available kin that's willing
 
04:36:37.189 --> 04:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
to care for that child that's the best
 
04:36:39.051 --> 04:36:39.061 align:start position:0%
place for the child debate currently we
 
04:36:40.369 --> 04:36:40.379 align:start position:0%
only get about a third of our kids in
 
04:36:42.289 --> 04:36:42.299 align:start position:0%
kinship Care New Jersey where I came
 
04:36:43.990 --> 04:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
from we got about half of our kids there
 
04:36:46.670 --> 04:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
some places like Allegheny County who've
 
04:36:47.929 --> 04:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
implemented this model that we're
 
04:36:50.269 --> 04:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
working on implementing right now get 70
 
04:36:52.189 --> 04:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
plus percent of their kids you can ship
 
04:36:54.769 --> 04:36:54.779 align:start position:0%
care out of state yes and actually we
 
04:36:56.750 --> 04:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
just entered into what is called a
 
04:36:58.010 --> 04:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
provisional placement agreement with
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for that exact purpose
 
04:37:03.709 --> 04:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
okay because the can the kinship even if
 
04:37:05.390 --> 04:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
they're out of state there's some still
 
04:37:07.970 --> 04:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
some supervisory role that the state
 
04:37:10.189 --> 04:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
provides under the interstate compact
 
04:37:11.810 --> 04:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
for the placement of children the other
 
04:37:14.029 --> 04:37:14.039 align:start position:0%
state has a responsibility to help do
 
04:37:15.650 --> 04:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
the licensure process for that kinship
 
04:37:17.810 --> 04:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
provider and help provide supervision
 
04:37:20.330 --> 04:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
for that kinship provider representative
 
04:37:21.769 --> 04:37:21.779 align:start position:0%
just that we're talking the same
 
04:37:24.529 --> 04:37:24.539 align:start position:0%
language can you better Define who was
 
04:37:26.631 --> 04:37:26.641 align:start position:0%
included in kinship right obviously
 
04:37:28.369 --> 04:37:28.379 align:start position:0%
immediate family but how much broader
 
04:37:30.170 --> 04:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
does it go yeah so statute was changed
 
04:37:31.551 --> 04:37:31.561 align:start position:0%
last year on top of my head I'm not
 
04:37:33.890 --> 04:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
remembering the the citation of that but
 
04:37:36.410 --> 04:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
I can get that for you and um the
 
04:37:38.150 --> 04:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
language is quite broad it basically is
 
04:37:40.189 --> 04:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
anybody who has a pre-existing caring
 
04:37:41.449 --> 04:37:41.459 align:start position:0%
relationship with a child or their
 
04:37:44.449 --> 04:37:44.459 align:start position:0%
parents right so the most common is a
 
04:37:45.769 --> 04:37:45.779 align:start position:0%
grandparent but it could be a member of
 
04:37:47.269 --> 04:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
the faith community it could be a family
 
04:37:47.279 --> 04:37:48.349 align:start position:0%
the faith community it could be a family
friend

04:37:48.349 --> 04:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
friend
 
04:37:50.269 --> 04:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
it could be anybody who has that
 
04:37:52.010 --> 04:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
pre-existing relationship with the
 
04:37:53.449 --> 04:37:53.459 align:start position:0%
parent and family
 
04:37:53.459 --> 04:37:54.769 align:start position:0%
parent and family
follow-up

04:37:54.769 --> 04:37:54.779 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:37:56.449 --> 04:37:56.459 align:start position:0%
do you remember what that statute change
 
04:37:58.789 --> 04:37:58.799 align:start position:0%
was I'll have I'll have to look it up I
 
04:38:00.170 --> 04:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
can give you the citation though as part
 
04:38:01.609 --> 04:38:01.619 align:start position:0%
of a big piece of legislation that
 
04:38:02.810 --> 04:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
passed last year with a whole lot of
 
04:38:04.670 --> 04:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
Human Services stuff in it
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
should be two
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
it wasn't hb2 it was I don't remember
 
04:38:09.529 --> 04:38:09.539 align:start position:0%
the number so the key thing I'm hearing
 
04:38:12.410 --> 04:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
you say is the eligibility under the
 
04:38:15.529 --> 04:38:15.539 align:start position:0%
Kinship Program really has very little
 
04:38:18.109 --> 04:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
to do with being a blood relationship of
 
04:38:20.209 --> 04:38:20.219 align:start position:0%
any kind it's just right it's a
 
04:38:22.789 --> 04:38:22.799 align:start position:0%
friendship relationship is even adequate
 
04:38:24.769 --> 04:38:24.779 align:start position:0%
right any type of kind of again
 
04:38:26.631 --> 04:38:26.641 align:start position:0%
pre-existing caring relationship with
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
the child and or the family so you know
 
04:38:31.551 --> 04:38:31.561 align:start position:0%
we hear stories and we've seen kids have
 
04:38:33.709 --> 04:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
very successful opportunities with the
 
04:38:35.570 --> 04:38:35.580 align:start position:0%
person who was the school bus driver who
 
04:38:37.910 --> 04:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
knew this kid for six years you know you
 
04:38:39.470 --> 04:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
see lots of really really interesting
 
04:38:40.970 --> 04:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
things come up
 
04:38:42.949 --> 04:38:42.959 align:start position:0%
show the hair on the back of my neck
 
04:38:45.949 --> 04:38:45.959 align:start position:0%
goes up here in that but so we're doing
 
04:38:49.070 --> 04:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
this in a safe way where kids are
 
04:38:51.529 --> 04:38:51.539 align:start position:0%
I don't know why that just made me yeah
 
04:38:54.590 --> 04:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
so part of this new process is actually
 
04:38:56.449 --> 04:38:56.459 align:start position:0%
to have those folks go through a
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
licensure process which wasn't right
 
04:39:00.529 --> 04:39:00.539 align:start position:0%
before this law change we didn't have a
 
04:39:02.150 --> 04:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
licensure process so it really was
 
04:39:04.609 --> 04:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
limited to only relatives now with this
 
04:39:05.869 --> 04:39:05.879 align:start position:0%
new change these folks will go through
 
04:39:07.250 --> 04:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
the full licensure process which
 
04:39:09.170 --> 04:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
includes a home study we always did a
 
04:39:10.369 --> 04:39:10.379 align:start position:0%
basic criminal background check but
 
04:39:11.810 --> 04:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
includes all those types of things as
 
04:39:11.820 --> 04:39:16.189 align:start position:0%
includes all those types of things as
well

04:39:16.189 --> 04:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:16.199 --> 04:39:19.609 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:39:19.609 --> 04:39:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
sure you you you haven't you have a new
 
04:39:24.890 --> 04:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
director it looks like from this bullet
 
04:39:26.029 --> 04:39:26.039 align:start position:0%
you have a new director and you're
 
04:39:28.390 --> 04:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
already implementing the
 
04:39:31.369 --> 04:39:31.379 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed therapeutic we're trying
 
04:39:32.990 --> 04:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
our best as I talked about here right
 
04:39:34.551 --> 04:39:34.561 align:start position:0%
there's limitations of how far we can go
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
but we did hire a new director in August
 
04:39:38.448 --> 04:39:38.458 align:start position:0%
our prior director
 
04:39:41.570 --> 04:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
um retired last December or January I'm
 
04:39:43.610 --> 04:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
not remembering right now the new
 
04:39:45.470 --> 04:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
director does have a clinical background
 
04:39:48.110 --> 04:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
themselves which is great this is the
 
04:39:49.368 --> 04:39:49.378 align:start position:0%
first time we had a clinician actually
 
04:39:51.230 --> 04:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
in charge of the facility and we've been
 
04:39:53.390 --> 04:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
able to finally as of two weeks ago fill
 
04:39:56.208 --> 04:39:56.218 align:start position:0%
the clinical positions through our
 
04:39:57.530 --> 04:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
contract with Dartmouth we have a
 
04:39:58.730 --> 04:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
contract with Dartmouth to have
 
04:40:02.448 --> 04:40:02.458 align:start position:0%
clinicians and a psychologist on site it
 
04:40:05.630 --> 04:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
took them over a year almost a year to
 
04:40:07.368 --> 04:40:07.378 align:start position:0%
fill the first clinical positions and
 
04:40:09.050 --> 04:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
the over position and over a year to
 
04:40:10.670 --> 04:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
fill the second one but we now do have a
 
04:40:12.770 --> 04:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
full team of clinicians director
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
position are you requiring an advanced
 
04:40:17.750 --> 04:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
degree a PhD what do you what what kind
 
04:40:20.090 --> 04:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
of job qualification is that yeah so we
 
04:40:21.830 --> 04:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
were so the requirement I think was a
 
04:40:23.930 --> 04:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
master's level but what I was really
 
04:40:25.550 --> 04:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
looking for was somebody who was a
 
04:40:27.230 --> 04:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
licensed clinician themselves who also
 
04:40:29.390 --> 04:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
had experience leading
 
04:40:31.010 --> 04:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
um you know a clinical residential
 
04:40:33.288 --> 04:40:33.298 align:start position:0%
program which this individual does
 
04:40:35.810 --> 04:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
those are hard to find even they are and
 
04:40:36.770 --> 04:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons I think it
 
04:40:38.810 --> 04:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
took eight ten months to fill it
 
04:40:38.820 --> 04:40:41.270 align:start position:0%
took eight ten months to fill it
representable

04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
representable
 
04:40:43.730 --> 04:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman I believe I met this
 
04:40:46.670 --> 04:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
new director Mr Thursday what was her
 
04:40:49.490 --> 04:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
name Mr Rocha wrote Gerald Roche is the
 
04:40:51.170 --> 04:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
director and Samantha Morin's the
 
04:40:52.490 --> 04:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
psychologist I think you met both of
 
04:40:55.850 --> 04:40:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:55.860 --> 04:40:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:40:59.208 --> 04:40:59.218 align:start position:0%
um the other big thing on here we jumped
 
04:41:00.770 --> 04:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
ahead a little bit to sysc was the
 
04:41:03.170 --> 04:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice rules of probation so
 
04:41:04.730 --> 04:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
we were able to work with the courts to
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
change the rules of probation for
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
juveniles um so even when a young person
 
04:41:09.650 --> 04:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
does go to court historically there was
 
04:41:12.410 --> 04:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
20 set in stone rules that never changed
 
04:41:14.030 --> 04:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
no matter what the underlying issue was
 
04:41:15.110 --> 04:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't make a whole lot of
 
04:41:17.448 --> 04:41:17.458 align:start position:0%
sense for young people we were able to
 
04:41:19.128 --> 04:41:19.138 align:start position:0%
change that with the Supreme Court
 
04:41:21.650 --> 04:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
approving the rule change to have them
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
be customized based on what the child
 
04:41:24.948 --> 04:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
actually did and what their needs
 
04:41:27.350 --> 04:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
actually are and the cans assessment
 
04:41:29.090 --> 04:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
helps inform what the individualized
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
rules of probation are for young people
 
04:41:31.910 --> 04:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
there are some that are standard right
 
04:41:33.470 --> 04:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
we don't want kids having weapons we
 
04:41:34.970 --> 04:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
don't want kids doing drugs but there's
 
04:41:36.590 --> 04:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that are customized
 
04:41:41.330 --> 04:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
based on what the underlying offense is
 
04:41:43.250 --> 04:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
and then the last big bucket here of
 
04:41:44.330 --> 04:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
accomplishments I would talk about
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
additional support for transition aged
 
04:41:46.080 --> 04:41:47.628 align:start position:0%
additional support for transition aged
youth

04:41:47.628 --> 04:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
youth
 
04:41:50.030 --> 04:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
so a few years ago we were able to
 
04:41:53.030 --> 04:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
expand the Foster Care Program in the
 
04:41:55.010 --> 04:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
state to include voluntary foster care
 
04:41:57.948 --> 04:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
for young people up to age 21. so before
 
04:42:00.410 --> 04:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
that at age 18 unless you were still in
 
04:42:01.310 --> 04:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
high school and then you could stay
 
04:42:03.410 --> 04:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
until you graduated high school you were
 
04:42:04.970 --> 04:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
let go out of the system at that point
 
04:42:06.770 --> 04:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
and you were on your own and for a lot
 
04:42:08.030 --> 04:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
of our young people
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
they were not successful a lot of young
 
04:42:12.350 --> 04:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
people ended up homeless ended up in
 
04:42:13.970 --> 04:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
lots of bad places because they weren't
 
04:42:17.090 --> 04:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
ready at 18 to be able to do this with
 
04:42:19.128 --> 04:42:19.138 align:start position:0%
the expansion of voluntary foster care
 
04:42:20.930 --> 04:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
to age 21 which are young people named
 
04:42:22.490 --> 04:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
The Hope program
 
04:42:25.368 --> 04:42:25.378 align:start position:0%
stands for housing and opportunities for
 
04:42:28.128 --> 04:42:28.138 align:start position:0%
personal Excellence that was they came
 
04:42:30.770 --> 04:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
up with that not me and I think it's
 
04:42:30.780 --> 04:42:31.750 align:start position:0%
up with that not me and I think it's
great

04:42:31.750 --> 04:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
but with that we now have you know quite
 
04:42:37.010 --> 04:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
a few young people who at 18 decide to
 
04:42:39.288 --> 04:42:39.298 align:start position:0%
stay with us and will then continue to
 
04:42:41.330 --> 04:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
support them up through age 21 you know
 
04:42:43.310 --> 04:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
if they choose to it's not it's not
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
required and you'll as we talk a little
 
04:42:47.750 --> 04:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
bit further through this you'll see some
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
other things that are changing in the
 
04:42:50.690 --> 04:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
system that we're asking for to try to
 
04:42:52.128 --> 04:42:52.138 align:start position:0%
better support those young people as we
 
04:42:53.930 --> 04:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
move on
 
04:42:55.730 --> 04:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hole for a
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
question sure on this voluntary program
 
04:43:00.590 --> 04:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
is the state picking up the call so just
 
04:43:02.030 --> 04:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
help me understand the foster care
 
04:43:03.770 --> 04:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
system right I believe the state picks
 
04:43:05.690 --> 04:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
up some of the costs for children up
 
04:43:07.850 --> 04:43:07.860 align:start position:0%
through 18 does that then go on in this
 
04:43:10.550 --> 04:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
program 321 or is it just allowing them
 
04:43:12.530 --> 04:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
to stay there because they've chosen to
 
04:43:15.708 --> 04:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
stay there no so it does there is
 
04:43:17.628 --> 04:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
um the way Foster Care is funded is
 
04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
primarily through something called title
 
04:43:21.230 --> 04:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
IV of the Social Security Act
 
04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
and title 4E is just like Medicaid kind
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
of a a matched entitlement program right
 
04:43:29.390 --> 04:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
so for you for families who qualify
 
04:43:30.948 --> 04:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
um half of the cost is picked up by the
 
04:43:32.270 --> 04:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
federal government the other half of the
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
cost is picked up by the state so the um
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
the expansion of this program we then
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
modified our plan with the feds to be
 
04:43:40.610 --> 04:43:40.620 align:start position:0%
able to include this population in that
 
04:43:42.288 --> 04:43:42.298 align:start position:0%
program so the feds do pay for part of
 
04:43:44.208 --> 04:43:44.218 align:start position:0%
it but just like other foster care they
 
04:43:48.050 --> 04:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:49.250 --> 04:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
um the housing opportunities for young
 
04:43:50.810 --> 04:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
people there could be foster homes could
 
04:43:52.550 --> 04:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
be group homes could be new Independent
 
04:43:53.930 --> 04:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
Living programs that we've set up but
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
for some other young people who are
 
04:43:56.570 --> 04:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
ready for it we'll be able to support
 
04:43:59.270 --> 04:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
them in moving into Apartments
 
04:44:00.830 --> 04:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
um if they're going to college support
 
04:44:03.170 --> 04:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
them through their on-campus housing
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
and other shared uh shared living
 
04:44:07.250 --> 04:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
arrangements so sometimes young people
 
04:44:09.650 --> 04:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
choose to to live together you know
 
04:44:10.730 --> 04:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
they'll choose to rent an apartment
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
together and we can help support that
 
04:44:13.610 --> 04:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
process through this
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
another big change over the past couple
 
04:44:17.270 --> 04:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
years was the implementation of
 
04:44:18.770 --> 04:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
something called Youth Villages life set
 
04:44:20.750 --> 04:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
YB life set which is an evidence-based
 
04:44:22.190 --> 04:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
program for transitioned youth
 
04:44:25.070 --> 04:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
transition aged youth to kind of help
 
04:44:26.750 --> 04:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
them do the type of planning and get
 
04:44:28.490 --> 04:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
ready for independent successful
 
04:44:30.530 --> 04:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
adulthood the way that you know all of
 
04:44:32.390 --> 04:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
us would want to do with our own kids
 
04:44:34.850 --> 04:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
and then last big partnership has been
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
with the housing authorities over the
 
04:44:37.570 --> 04:44:37.580 align:start position:0%
past couple years
 
04:44:40.610 --> 04:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
both the local and the state to be able
 
04:44:43.070 --> 04:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
to apply to HUD for different types of
 
04:44:44.570 --> 04:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
housing vouchers to support young people
 
04:44:46.670 --> 04:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
who have aged out of foster care or
 
04:44:48.590 --> 04:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
families who are at risk of entering
 
04:44:50.208 --> 04:44:50.218 align:start position:0%
foster care as a result of housing
 
04:44:50.218 --> 04:44:53.270 align:start position:0%
foster care as a result of housing
instability

04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:54.770 --> 04:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
and if there's no other questions on
 
04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
that I'll move on to the next page which
 
04:44:58.010 --> 04:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
is key challenges
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
age six correct yes that's right thank
 
04:45:00.360 --> 04:45:02.030 align:start position:0%
age six correct yes that's right thank
you

04:45:02.030 --> 04:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:45:04.128 --> 04:45:04.138 align:start position:0%
okay key challenges
 
04:45:05.330 --> 04:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
um I think the biggest one that I put
 
04:45:06.890 --> 04:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
forward is Workforce which I think
 
04:45:08.570 --> 04:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
you've heard in a lot of other forums as
 
04:45:10.788 --> 04:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
well hiring and retaining child
 
04:45:12.948 --> 04:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
protection and sysc staff remains a
 
04:45:14.690 --> 04:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
significant challenge we're actually
 
04:45:16.250 --> 04:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
doing better with child protection staff
 
04:45:18.050 --> 04:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
than we had been in years past I think
 
04:45:19.670 --> 04:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
the current vacancy rate is about 15
 
04:45:21.708 --> 04:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
percent which while still tough is
 
04:45:23.810 --> 04:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
better than I think the Department's
 
04:45:25.250 --> 04:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
average vacancy rate and better than the
 
04:45:26.570 --> 04:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
state's average vacancy rate at this
 
04:45:28.550 --> 04:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
point which is you know saying something
 
04:45:30.470 --> 04:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
given um you know kind of how far behind
 
04:45:32.570 --> 04:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
we were just a few years ago but we
 
04:45:35.810 --> 04:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
still need to get those positions filled
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
um recent data shows that actually we
 
04:45:39.110 --> 04:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
have an increasing demand and I'll walk
 
04:45:40.670 --> 04:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
through this data with folks but an
 
04:45:42.590 --> 04:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
increasing demand at intake that's at
 
04:45:44.208 --> 04:45:44.218 align:start position:0%
the hotline for call volume and
 
04:45:45.410 --> 04:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
increasing demand for no child
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
protection assessments and then
 
04:45:48.708 --> 04:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
increasing demand for family service
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
cases those are the cases that actually
 
04:45:51.890 --> 04:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
do have to get brought in and go to
 
04:45:54.288 --> 04:45:54.298 align:start position:0%
court over the past year adding
 
04:45:57.050 --> 04:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
additional pressure to the system
 
04:45:59.288 --> 04:45:59.298 align:start position:0%
some things that have helped we have had
 
04:46:01.368 --> 04:46:01.378 align:start position:0%
pain enhancements through the last
 
04:46:03.650 --> 04:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
biennium for child protection and sysc
 
04:46:07.448 --> 04:46:07.458 align:start position:0%
staff and that has helped I think reduce
 
04:46:10.250 --> 04:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
the vacancy rate and improve stability
 
04:46:12.050 --> 04:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
of the workforce there and probably why
 
04:46:14.570 --> 04:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
we're better than we were a couple years
 
04:46:16.128 --> 04:46:16.138 align:start position:0%
ago and maybe better than the Statewide
 
04:46:18.470 --> 04:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
average but we're still not quite where
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
we need to be and I'm hopeful that
 
04:46:22.970 --> 04:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
between those increases and through
 
04:46:25.128 --> 04:46:25.138 align:start position:0%
salary increases that have been part of
 
04:46:27.128 --> 04:46:27.138 align:start position:0%
the collecting bargaining program will
 
04:46:30.708 --> 04:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
will see increased retention increase
 
04:46:34.490 --> 04:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
hiring capacity for these key positions
 
04:46:36.350 --> 04:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
um we did ask for in our prioritized
 
04:46:38.208 --> 04:46:38.218 align:start position:0%
needs a couple different things one was
 
04:46:39.650 --> 04:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
to create something called an impact
 
04:46:41.570 --> 04:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
team to help mitigate the cascading
 
04:46:43.250 --> 04:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
impact of turnover over the past few
 
04:46:45.708 --> 04:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
years and this is a model that we used
 
04:46:48.050 --> 04:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
in New Jersey to try to help stabilize
 
04:46:50.090 --> 04:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
uh when you start seeing turnover in the
 
04:46:52.310 --> 04:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
field so you can imagine if you're
 
04:46:53.750 --> 04:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
working in a district office and a
 
04:46:56.090 --> 04:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
couple people leave all their work gets
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
redistributed to other staff that then
 
04:47:00.350 --> 04:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
actually in many instances has actually
 
04:47:02.270 --> 04:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
contributed to increased turnover where
 
04:47:04.128 --> 04:47:04.138 align:start position:0%
those other staff feel overwhelmed and
 
04:47:06.350 --> 04:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
then they look to leave too what the
 
04:47:08.208 --> 04:47:08.218 align:start position:0%
impact team would be and what we set up
 
04:47:09.650 --> 04:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
in New Jersey to try to prevent that
 
04:47:11.810 --> 04:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
from happening it's a central Statewide
 
04:47:13.368 --> 04:47:13.378 align:start position:0%
group that could be deployed to those
 
04:47:15.530 --> 04:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
offices when those things happen so that
 
04:47:17.150 --> 04:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
you could prevent that kind of overflow
 
04:47:19.610 --> 04:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
and that overwhelming of staff that then
 
04:47:22.010 --> 04:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
leads to cascading and growing turnover
 
04:47:24.410 --> 04:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
within those offices so we did put in a
 
04:47:26.330 --> 04:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs request for that we
 
04:47:27.890 --> 04:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
also put in a prioritize needs request
 
04:47:30.650 --> 04:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
for 12 additional case Aid positions so
 
04:47:32.270 --> 04:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
this is a new position we created first
 
04:47:34.128 --> 04:47:34.138 align:start position:0%
time a few years ago it's kind of like a
 
04:47:36.230 --> 04:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional type perfect position
 
04:47:38.690 --> 04:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
for child protection workers oftentimes
 
04:47:40.610 --> 04:47:40.620 align:start position:0%
we'll get Young Folks younger folks in
 
04:47:42.650 --> 04:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
there who maybe finished an associate's
 
04:47:43.970 --> 04:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
degree or something like that and want
 
04:47:46.010 --> 04:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
to go on to get a bachelor's degree and
 
04:47:47.930 --> 04:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
to become Child Protection workers and
 
04:47:49.368 --> 04:47:49.378 align:start position:0%
they'll step into these roles where they
 
04:47:50.810 --> 04:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
can you know help transport kids
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
supervise visits help with paperwork
 
04:47:54.650 --> 04:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
whatever it is it's more of a
 
04:47:57.170 --> 04:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional role and then a lot of
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
times we're actually seeing these people
 
04:48:00.110 --> 04:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
then be able to move up into the child
 
04:48:01.550 --> 04:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
protection positions which is really
 
04:48:02.990 --> 04:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
great to have that kind of stepping
 
04:48:04.368 --> 04:48:04.378 align:start position:0%
stone for folks to have some career
 
04:48:04.378 --> 04:48:05.510 align:start position:0%
stone for folks to have some career
advancement

04:48:05.510 --> 04:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
advancement
 
04:48:06.770 --> 04:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
um in a way that we haven't had before
 
04:48:08.930 --> 04:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
the hope is that if we're able to add
 
04:48:10.070 --> 04:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
some more of these folks it would
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
relieve some pressure from our Frontline
 
04:48:13.128 --> 04:48:13.138 align:start position:0%
staff which have been harder positions
 
04:48:16.310 --> 04:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative talerski for a question
 
04:48:21.470 --> 04:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you regarding the staff challenges
 
04:48:25.430 --> 04:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
at um the youth center I recall you
 
04:48:27.470 --> 04:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
saying that you remove workers got moved
 
04:48:29.090 --> 04:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
around different places to cover some
 
04:48:31.128 --> 04:48:31.138 align:start position:0%
severe needs where there were vacancies
 
04:48:34.010 --> 04:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
where all those workers compensated at a
 
04:48:35.810 --> 04:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
level that they should have been or did
 
04:48:37.550 --> 04:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
you have to use enhancements to get them
 
04:48:39.530 --> 04:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
to cover those spots or are there
 
04:48:39.540 --> 04:48:40.390 align:start position:0%
to cover those spots or are there
different

04:48:40.390 --> 04:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:48:43.610 --> 04:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
problems that come up with that yes so
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
at sysc as we as we've shared here
 
04:48:47.990 --> 04:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
before right we're running with a major
 
04:48:49.850 --> 04:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
major vacancies right we need about 40
 
04:48:52.070 --> 04:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
to 45 front line youth counselors we
 
04:48:54.230 --> 04:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
call them we have I think it's 17 on the
 
04:48:55.550 --> 04:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
books today although we have a couple in
 
04:48:57.470 --> 04:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
the pipeline that are that look like
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a couple of the
 
04:49:02.150 --> 04:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
positions filled um which is great
 
04:49:03.708 --> 04:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
um not anywhere near what we need but
 
04:49:04.970 --> 04:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
it's good to finally see some people
 
04:49:06.770 --> 04:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
applying for and starting to jump into
 
04:49:08.330 --> 04:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
these jobs
 
04:49:08.340 --> 04:49:08.868 align:start position:0%
these jobs
um

04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:10.910 --> 04:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
so we've been filling those gaps with
 
04:49:13.990 --> 04:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of overtime over time
 
04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
offered to folks who work elsewhere in
 
04:49:19.550 --> 04:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
DHHS and also over time to folks who
 
04:49:21.530 --> 04:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
have been mandated to work down there so
 
04:49:24.170 --> 04:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
our juvenile probation staff have
 
04:49:25.850 --> 04:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
sometimes been mandated to work done
 
04:49:27.948 --> 04:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
there we're currently operating under a
 
04:49:30.470 --> 04:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
mandate meaning that if we're short we
 
04:49:33.350 --> 04:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
will require staff based in seniority
 
04:49:34.970 --> 04:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
order we go through the list to go down
 
04:49:36.230 --> 04:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
there and cover shifts and pick up
 
04:49:38.448 --> 04:49:38.458 align:start position:0%
fortunately the last few weeks we've had
 
04:49:39.890 --> 04:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
enough volunteers that nobody had to be
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
mandated but it's still kind of a threat
 
04:49:44.208 --> 04:49:44.218 align:start position:0%
at any given time that if the census
 
04:49:46.128 --> 04:49:46.138 align:start position:0%
goes up and we need additional staff to
 
04:49:48.050 --> 04:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
keep it safe or if we don't have enough
 
04:49:49.550 --> 04:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
volunteers at any given time that we
 
04:49:51.650 --> 04:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
could be mandating staff to go in so
 
04:49:53.750 --> 04:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
those staff do get time and a half for
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
their time there but I think there's a
 
04:49:57.410 --> 04:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
lot of frustration amongst a lot of
 
04:50:00.050 --> 04:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
those staff because I spoke before about
 
04:50:01.550 --> 04:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
the enhancements that are occurring
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
right so our child protection staff are
 
04:50:05.750 --> 04:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
receiving enhancements and our youth
 
04:50:07.128 --> 04:50:07.138 align:start position:0%
counselors are receiving enhancements
 
04:50:09.670 --> 04:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
but the juvenile probation staff do not
 
04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
so I think there's you know it's
 
04:50:13.010 --> 04:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
definitely had a morale hit on those
 
04:50:14.448 --> 04:50:14.458 align:start position:0%
folks who really feel like they've been
 
04:50:16.550 --> 04:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
stepping up and and doing more but they
 
04:50:17.930 --> 04:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
don't qualify for those enhancements
 
04:50:20.990 --> 04:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
follow up thanks can you explain why
 
04:50:24.530 --> 04:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
they don't qualify for that
 
04:50:27.170 --> 04:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
sure so the enhancement process as I
 
04:50:28.490 --> 04:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
best understand it and I'm not the
 
04:50:31.128 --> 04:50:31.138 align:start position:0%
expert but the enhancement process is
 
04:50:33.708 --> 04:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
the statutory process where when you
 
04:50:35.390 --> 04:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
look at certain types of positions and
 
04:50:37.070 --> 04:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
there's critical levels of vacancy as
 
04:50:40.190 --> 04:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
you can go before dop and then GNC to
 
04:50:42.948 --> 04:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
get approval for a salary enhancement to
 
04:50:44.930 --> 04:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
bring those levels to a bring that pay
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
to a level where you can hire additional
 
04:50:48.650 --> 04:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
staff the juvenile probation officers
 
04:50:50.690 --> 04:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
those positions are actually been pretty
 
04:50:53.030 --> 04:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
well staffed which is great but they
 
04:50:55.070 --> 04:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
don't quite fit into that categorization
 
04:50:57.230 --> 04:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
of of being so short staffed that they
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
would require an enhancement to get
 
04:51:01.368 --> 04:51:01.378 align:start position:0%
those positions filled while that makes
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
sense to me from the way that that
 
04:51:04.490 --> 04:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
process works it does definitely have
 
04:51:06.770 --> 04:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
you know morale impacts across across
 
04:51:08.208 --> 04:51:08.218 align:start position:0%
staff feeling like they're not being
 
04:51:09.770 --> 04:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
treated you know equally across the
 
04:51:09.780 --> 04:51:15.708 align:start position:0%
treated you know equally across the
division

04:51:15.708 --> 04:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:17.090 --> 04:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
um where was I
 
04:51:19.070 --> 04:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
okay I was moving on to the next section
 
04:51:20.330 --> 04:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
which was additional support for
 
04:51:22.850 --> 04:51:22.860 align:start position:0%
alternative caregivers
 
04:51:24.288 --> 04:51:24.298 align:start position:0%
um what we've seen in the past few years
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
so caregivers when I talk about
 
04:51:27.170 --> 04:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
caregivers I'm talking about lots of
 
04:51:28.850 --> 04:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
different places these are folks who are
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
caring for children that are not their
 
04:51:32.868 --> 04:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
own right it could be foster parents
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
could be adoptive parents could be in a
 
04:51:36.530 --> 04:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
residential program
 
04:51:37.970 --> 04:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
um lots of different places but we have
 
04:51:39.770 --> 04:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
seen caregivers being under increased
 
04:51:42.590 --> 04:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
Financial stress in recent years due to
 
04:51:45.470 --> 04:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
Major economic shifts and local Regional
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
and National shortages of options for
 
04:51:49.368 --> 04:51:49.378 align:start position:0%
children in need of out of home care so
 
04:51:50.510 --> 04:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
basically what I'm talking about here is
 
04:51:51.470 --> 04:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
what we're just talking about a minute
 
04:51:53.868 --> 04:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
ago right foster care not quite having
 
04:51:55.128 --> 04:51:55.138 align:start position:0%
enough foster parents that we need
 
04:51:57.250 --> 04:51:57.260 align:start position:0%
foster parents not having
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates that align with the
 
04:52:00.708 --> 04:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
current costs of raising children
 
04:52:04.730 --> 04:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
anymore and residential programs not
 
04:52:06.288 --> 04:52:06.298 align:start position:0%
having the workforce necessary to have
 
04:52:07.670 --> 04:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
their beds open to meet all the needs
 
04:52:09.530 --> 04:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
and that puts a lot of pressure on our
 
04:52:10.910 --> 04:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
staff when they're trying to find a safe
 
04:52:12.650 --> 04:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
place for a child to be in a crisis
 
04:52:15.708 --> 04:52:15.718 align:start position:0%
situation we did have we do have a
 
04:52:18.250 --> 04:52:18.260 align:start position:0%
prioritized need in the budget request
 
04:52:20.868 --> 04:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
to increase foster care rates to align
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
with the USDA media cost of raising a
 
04:52:24.530 --> 04:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
child in New Hampshire
 
04:52:26.868 --> 04:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
and I believe the governor did identify
 
04:52:29.150 --> 04:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
that one in the governor's proposed
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
budget as one to fund so I'd hope to
 
04:52:33.948 --> 04:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
continue to have support for that
 
04:52:36.110 --> 04:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
there's also a prioritized need in the
 
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
behavioral health budget which I'm sure
 
04:52:39.470 --> 04:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
they'll go into more deeply around doing
 
04:52:41.330 --> 04:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
a similar thing for residential programs
 
04:52:43.730 --> 04:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned before right Behavioral
 
04:52:45.170 --> 04:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
Health we've kind of intentionally put
 
04:52:46.730 --> 04:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health in charge of things
 
04:52:48.890 --> 04:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
like residential care because right if a
 
04:52:50.448 --> 04:52:50.458 align:start position:0%
kid's going there it's because yes they
 
04:52:51.770 --> 04:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
need a place to live but also because
 
04:52:54.050 --> 04:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
they need treatment so we intentionally
 
04:52:55.610 --> 04:52:55.620 align:start position:0%
have moved oversight of those away from
 
04:52:57.530 --> 04:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
dcyf into children's Behavioral Health
 
04:53:00.110 --> 04:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
but a lot of the kids they serve are our
 
04:53:02.868 --> 04:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
kids right they're the dcyf kids and
 
04:53:05.208 --> 04:53:05.218 align:start position:0%
those programs are really struggling to
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
open up all their beds because of
 
04:53:08.390 --> 04:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
Workforce issues
 
04:53:12.948 --> 04:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
I mentioned before this um in the key uh
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
in the key accomplishments the work
 
04:53:16.670 --> 04:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
around Kinship Caregivers so we are
 
04:53:18.110 --> 04:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
going to be creating a new kinship
 
04:53:22.010 --> 04:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
caregiver license type which will allow
 
04:53:23.750 --> 04:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
allows us to waive some of the things
 
04:53:25.610 --> 04:53:25.620 align:start position:0%
that are required for regular foster
 
04:53:27.470 --> 04:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
parents things like room sizes and stuff
 
04:53:29.990 --> 04:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
like that that isn't really key to a
 
04:53:31.550 --> 04:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
child's safety or well-being and when
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
you're kind of balancing you know the
 
04:53:35.090 --> 04:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
size of a bedroom for staying with
 
04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
Grandmom it should be a pretty easy
 
04:53:38.150 --> 04:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
decision for most people that even if
 
04:53:39.288 --> 04:53:39.298 align:start position:0%
the bedroom's smaller staying with
 
04:53:40.610 --> 04:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
Grandma's probably the best thing for
 
04:53:43.490 --> 04:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
the kid well historically you couldn't
 
04:53:45.050 --> 04:53:45.060 align:start position:0%
actually make that decision and license
 
04:53:46.730 --> 04:53:46.740 align:start position:0%
that grandmother if her room size wasn't
 
04:53:48.650 --> 04:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
right the feds allow you to waive things
 
04:53:50.510 --> 04:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
like that for kin so we're going through
 
04:53:52.610 --> 04:53:52.620 align:start position:0%
creating a new licensure scheme for
 
04:53:54.708 --> 04:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
those Kinship Caregivers So eventually
 
04:53:56.330 --> 04:53:56.340 align:start position:0%
when that's ready that'll be coming back
 
04:53:58.190 --> 04:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
to the legislature through jail car to
 
04:53:59.930 --> 04:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
take a look at that
 
04:53:59.940 --> 04:54:01.190 align:start position:0%
take a look at that
um

04:54:01.190 --> 04:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:03.288 --> 04:54:03.298 align:start position:0%
it is going to be slightly delayed from
 
04:54:04.670 --> 04:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
where we originally thought because the
 
04:54:06.050 --> 04:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
feds are actually in the process of
 
04:54:08.330 --> 04:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
redoing their regs related to this and
 
04:54:09.288 --> 04:54:09.298 align:start position:0%
we don't want to put out a new
 
04:54:11.510 --> 04:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
regulatory scheme and then find out six
 
04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
months later that we did something that
 
04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
has to be Rewritten all over again so
 
04:54:15.830 --> 04:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to wait to see what the feds
 
04:54:17.330 --> 04:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
do before we bring that back here the
 
04:54:18.770 --> 04:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
original goal was to get that to the
 
04:54:20.390 --> 04:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
legislature this spring but it'll
 
04:54:21.650 --> 04:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
probably be a little more like this fall
 
04:54:22.970 --> 04:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
while we wait for the feds to finish
 
04:54:24.770 --> 04:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
their piece of it
 
04:54:27.890 --> 04:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
and then there is a piece of legislation
 
04:54:29.330 --> 04:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
out there that I think is also helpful
 
04:54:33.470 --> 04:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
for caregivers SB 172. and what this
 
04:54:35.090 --> 04:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
would do is it would allow the TANF
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
benefit that currently can go to like
 
04:54:40.430 --> 04:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
grandparents and relative caregivers to
 
04:54:42.410 --> 04:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
also go to those fictive kin caregivers
 
04:54:43.610 --> 04:54:43.620 align:start position:0%
right those people that we were just
 
04:54:45.050 --> 04:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
talking about like the the neighbor
 
04:54:46.550 --> 04:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
who's been involved in the child's life
 
04:54:49.070 --> 04:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
we heard lots of testimony from these
 
04:54:50.448 --> 04:54:50.458 align:start position:0%
folks who have stepped up to care for
 
04:54:51.948 --> 04:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
kids but they don't qualify for that
 
04:54:54.288 --> 04:54:54.298 align:start position:0%
benefit the feds would allow us to use
 
04:54:56.090 --> 04:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
TANF dollars for that purpose but we do
 
04:54:57.708 --> 04:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
need to change our statute to align with
 
04:54:59.390 --> 04:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
that so that's a piece of legislation
 
04:55:01.970 --> 04:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
that I anticipate will clear the Senate
 
04:55:04.090 --> 04:55:04.100 align:start position:0%
and be coming over here at some point
 
04:55:10.490 --> 04:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
and then lastly in the key challenges
 
04:55:14.270 --> 04:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
area it's additional support for
 
04:55:17.208 --> 04:55:17.218 align:start position:0%
children youth and families so
 
04:55:19.550 --> 04:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
recent unanticipated system changes have
 
04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
shifted Demand on necessary programs and
 
04:55:23.208 --> 04:55:23.218 align:start position:0%
services to support children youth and
 
04:55:24.770 --> 04:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
families outside of the formal child
 
04:55:26.868 --> 04:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
protection of Juvenile Justice System
 
04:55:28.910 --> 04:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
you do have a prioritized need in our
 
04:55:31.610 --> 04:55:31.620 align:start position:0%
request for Statewide Juvenile Diversion
 
04:55:33.650 --> 04:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
programming one of the things that we're
 
04:55:34.788 --> 04:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
seeing as we're going through the new
 
04:55:36.170 --> 04:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
assessment process is that we're
 
04:55:37.788 --> 04:55:37.798 align:start position:0%
identifying kids who need a diversion
 
04:55:39.470 --> 04:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
program and what diversion programs do
 
04:55:41.390 --> 04:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
is a restorative justice program with
 
04:55:43.310 --> 04:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
young people
 
04:55:44.868 --> 04:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately we don't have those
 
04:55:46.070 --> 04:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
programs all over the state because
 
04:55:47.330 --> 04:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
they're locally funded and some
 
04:55:48.770 --> 04:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
communities choose to do them and other
 
04:55:50.390 --> 04:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
communities don't choose to do them so
 
04:55:52.190 --> 04:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
we're doing now a Statewide process to
 
04:55:55.430 --> 04:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
assess needs but not every kid depending
 
04:55:57.050 --> 04:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
on where they live has access to that
 
04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
kind of service which is a problem so
 
04:56:01.610 --> 04:56:01.620 align:start position:0%
the hope is for support to be able to
 
04:56:03.470 --> 04:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
fund a Statewide Juvenile Diversion
 
04:56:05.030 --> 04:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
program to be able to provide that
 
04:56:06.830 --> 04:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
service equitably across the state to
 
04:56:08.510 --> 04:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
all of our kids
 
04:56:10.788 --> 04:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to piggyback off of your
 
04:56:14.208 --> 04:56:14.218 align:start position:0%
use of the word equity and just ask if
 
04:56:16.850 --> 04:56:16.860 align:start position:0%
you're working with the the new director
 
04:56:20.690 --> 04:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
Reuben Hampton to make sure that that
 
04:56:24.350 --> 04:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
any gaps that we have or he can help
 
04:56:28.310 --> 04:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
identify and re settle down on fixing
 
04:56:30.830 --> 04:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
those yep absolutely and honestly I
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
haven't I've met Reuben but he and I
 
04:56:33.770 --> 04:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
haven't had our kind of first one-to-one
 
04:56:35.030 --> 04:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
intro meeting I think it's on the books
 
04:56:36.530 --> 04:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
for later this week so I'm looking
 
04:56:39.050 --> 04:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
forward to that but yes that'll be a key
 
04:56:42.530 --> 04:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:44.690 --> 04:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
um there was our next one here
 
04:56:46.730 --> 04:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
um there's a prioritized need that will
 
04:56:47.930 --> 04:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
be coming forward from the division of
 
04:56:49.550 --> 04:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
economic stability to better support
 
04:56:52.010 --> 04:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers so I talked a
 
04:56:53.570 --> 04:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
little bit a little while ago about the
 
04:56:55.070 --> 04:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
new community Navigator program that
 
04:56:57.170 --> 04:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
we're standing up we anticipate that
 
04:56:58.550 --> 04:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
with that we're going to have more and
 
04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
more referrals to Our Family Resource
 
04:57:02.570 --> 04:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
Centers but historically again the state
 
04:57:04.310 --> 04:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
hasn't actually funded their operations
 
04:57:06.350 --> 04:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
they're locally funded some are better
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
resourced than others some places of the
 
04:57:10.310 --> 04:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
state we don't have access at all and
 
04:57:11.990 --> 04:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
you'll hear more about that when when
 
04:57:14.090 --> 04:57:14.100 align:start position:0%
economic stability comes forward to to
 
04:57:16.550 --> 04:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
give their presentation and then lastly
 
04:57:17.868 --> 04:57:17.878 align:start position:0%
there is a bill moving through the
 
04:57:20.510 --> 04:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
Senate right now Senate Bill 154 it's in
 
04:57:21.890 --> 04:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
partnership with UNH in the community
 
04:57:24.350 --> 04:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
college system and it authorizes an
 
04:57:26.270 --> 04:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
expansion of the tuition waiver program
 
04:57:26.280 --> 04:57:28.070 align:start position:0%
expansion of the tuition waiver program
so

04:57:28.070 --> 04:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:28.080 --> 04:57:29.448 align:start position:0%
so
yes

04:57:29.448 --> 04:57:29.458 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:57:31.368 --> 04:57:31.378 align:start position:0%
are we going to ask anything in return
 
04:57:33.590 --> 04:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of families that
 
04:57:35.868 --> 04:57:35.878 align:start position:0%
would like some tuition assistance if
 
04:57:37.010 --> 04:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to provide tuition
 
04:57:39.590 --> 04:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
assistance are we going to receive
 
04:57:41.990 --> 04:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
something back like you know they're
 
04:57:44.270 --> 04:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
going to go into a shortage area like
 
04:57:46.970 --> 04:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
health care or so this is this is a
 
04:57:48.470 --> 04:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
program that already exists on the books
 
04:57:50.390 --> 04:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
for young people who are aging out of
 
04:57:52.070 --> 04:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
foster care who were adopted out of
 
04:57:55.310 --> 04:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
foster care and it has I think about 30
 
04:57:58.730 --> 04:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
or 35 slots right now and what we've
 
04:58:00.170 --> 04:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
seen with the expansion of the Hope
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
program is the ability of more and more
 
04:58:05.270 --> 04:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
young people to actually enter a program
 
04:58:07.250 --> 04:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
is there any obligated service any
 
04:58:09.410 --> 04:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
payback on their part the obligated
 
04:58:11.090 --> 04:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
service of the payback I think is
 
04:58:12.530 --> 04:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
actually having our young people leave
 
04:58:14.448 --> 04:58:14.458 align:start position:0%
foster care and be productive members of
 
04:58:16.490 --> 04:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
society oh no so there's not a
 
04:58:19.010 --> 04:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
requirement that they do XYZ thing after
 
04:58:21.470 --> 04:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
they complete the program now okay I
 
04:58:23.390 --> 04:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
mean in the military people go to
 
04:58:25.550 --> 04:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan in order to get some help
 
04:58:28.010 --> 04:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
with college I don't think leaving
 
04:58:30.590 --> 04:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
foster care quite Rises to that level
 
04:58:33.770 --> 04:58:33.780 align:start position:0%
but I you know I think we have a lot of
 
04:58:35.868 --> 04:58:35.878 align:start position:0%
young folks who have for a long time
 
04:58:37.730 --> 04:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
struggled to be able to get on their
 
04:58:39.948 --> 04:58:39.958 align:start position:0%
feet and don't have all the advantages
 
04:58:41.270 --> 04:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
that a lot of other folks have when
 
04:58:42.948 --> 04:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
entering um you know trying to figure
 
04:58:44.930 --> 04:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
out how to enter the workforce and such
 
04:58:47.150 --> 04:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
and this is a program that the
 
04:58:48.530 --> 04:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
university system the community college
 
04:58:50.590 --> 04:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
system is eager to support us with
 
04:58:52.910 --> 04:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually require the state to
 
04:58:54.890 --> 04:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
put additional resources into it thank
 
04:58:57.708 --> 04:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
you yep
 
04:59:00.590 --> 04:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
and I will move on to page seven if
 
04:59:00.600 --> 04:59:02.390 align:start position:0%
and I will move on to page seven if
folks

04:59:02.390 --> 04:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
folks
 
04:59:07.850 --> 04:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:11.690 --> 04:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:14.208 --> 04:59:14.218 align:start position:0%
I can try to talk more quickly those two
 
04:59:16.128 --> 04:59:16.138 align:start position:0%
slides were the dense system Mr Ripple
 
04:59:18.410 --> 04:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
in in two years if we're back at this
 
04:59:18.420 --> 04:59:20.030 align:start position:0%
in in two years if we're back at this
again

04:59:20.030 --> 04:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:59:22.550 --> 04:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
this this stuff that we heard up until
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
now is all great material but this would
 
04:59:27.410 --> 04:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
be really good to have before the budget
 
04:59:29.990 --> 04:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
shows up because because I these were
 
04:59:32.810 --> 04:59:32.820 align:start position:0%
not Financial numbers you know these are
 
04:59:35.330 --> 04:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
programs accomplishments all great
 
04:59:37.910 --> 04:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
information but we have such a scarce
 
04:59:39.650 --> 04:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
amount of time to deal with the budget
 
04:59:43.070 --> 04:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
that uh if we could you know shift it in
 
04:59:45.530 --> 04:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
the future that would be great
 
04:59:45.540 --> 04:59:47.448 align:start position:0%
the future that would be great
sure

04:59:47.448 --> 04:59:47.458 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:59:49.610 --> 04:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
all right so this is kind of just
 
04:59:50.930 --> 04:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
showing you where everything exists
 
04:59:52.010 --> 04:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
within the Bureau of field services
 
04:59:53.810 --> 04:59:53.820 align:start position:0%
budget again field service is
 
04:59:55.490 --> 04:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
responsible for all Juvenile Justice and
 
04:59:56.948 --> 04:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
Child Protection field operations
 
04:59:59.270 --> 04:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
exercise Statewide through our district
 
05:00:00.948 --> 05:00:00.958 align:start position:0%
office structure
 
05:00:02.448 --> 05:00:02.458 align:start position:0%
um that includes our assessments our
 
05:00:04.490 --> 05:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
ongoing cases Court work service
 
05:00:06.890 --> 05:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
matching placements etc for both
 
05:00:09.890 --> 05:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice and child protection I
 
05:00:10.970 --> 05:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
don't know Nathan if you're going to
 
05:00:13.970 --> 05:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:16.310 --> 05:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
to Chairman Edwards would you like us to
 
05:00:17.990 --> 05:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
go through each account
 
05:00:19.788 --> 05:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
or or would you like to keep it at a
 
05:00:21.708 --> 05:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
higher level
 
05:00:24.110 --> 05:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
I you know I definitely want to hit some
 
05:00:26.570 --> 05:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
some of the high points here like uh I'd
 
05:00:29.208 --> 05:00:29.218 align:start position:0%
like to crosswalk these Personnel lines
 
05:00:32.208 --> 05:00:32.218 align:start position:0%
because as I I just was trying to do it
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
um ad hoc earlier I didn't I didn't see
 
05:00:37.788 --> 05:00:37.798 align:start position:0%
how the where the numbers lined up for
 
05:00:40.910 --> 05:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
the personnel and then I noticed that in
 
05:00:43.788 --> 05:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
between Pages there's the domestic
 
05:00:46.730 --> 05:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
violence program that I don't see listed
 
05:00:50.270 --> 05:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
amongst these and so I I I'd like to ask
 
05:00:51.890 --> 05:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
about that too since we're covering
 
05:00:55.788 --> 05:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
those pages sure so um if you turn to
 
05:00:57.948 --> 05:00:57.958 align:start position:0%
page 875 of the governor's recommended
 
05:00:57.958 --> 05:00:59.448 align:start position:0%
page 875 of the governor's recommended
budget

05:00:59.448 --> 05:00:59.458 align:start position:0%
budget
 
05:01:01.610 --> 05:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
um the the first accounting unit there
 
05:01:05.390 --> 05:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
the emergency cyf fund this is actually
 
05:01:08.030 --> 05:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
part of uh hb2 from this past
 
05:01:10.128 --> 05:01:10.138 align:start position:0%
legislative session and this was
 
05:01:12.050 --> 05:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
established it was a fun to support
 
05:01:15.288 --> 05:01:15.298 align:start position:0%
families in emergency situations
 
05:01:19.430 --> 05:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
the the second if if you turn to the the
 
05:01:23.570 --> 05:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:25.310 --> 05:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
um this is the this is the overall
 
05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
Office of the director
 
05:01:29.150 --> 05:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there are any
 
05:01:32.570 --> 05:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
specific questions uh there we do have
 
05:01:34.850 --> 05:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
some position movements
 
05:01:36.708 --> 05:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
um and on the on the position movement
 
05:01:39.650 --> 05:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
document that I that I handed out
 
05:01:41.930 --> 05:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of positions that
 
05:01:44.270 --> 05:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
that are moving into this accounting
 
05:01:45.890 --> 05:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
unit and then we've identified the
 
05:01:47.090 --> 05:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
accounting units that they come from
 
05:01:50.270 --> 05:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
there are also two full-time temporary
 
05:01:52.070 --> 05:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
positions that will be being converted
 
05:01:55.550 --> 05:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
to full-time authorized positions one
 
05:01:56.750 --> 05:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
thing just to keep in mind for the
 
05:01:58.490 --> 05:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
entirety of dcyf and this is my
 
05:01:58.500 --> 05:01:59.810 align:start position:0%
entirety of dcyf and this is my
oversight

05:01:59.810 --> 05:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
05:02:01.490 --> 05:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
um we do have 50 positions that are
 
05:02:04.310 --> 05:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
being abolished from sysc that that are
 
05:02:07.070 --> 05:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
not filled today and we had talked about
 
05:02:08.750 --> 05:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
that I think last week or the week
 
05:02:08.760 --> 05:02:09.770 align:start position:0%
that I think last week or the week
before

05:02:09.770 --> 05:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:02:09.780 --> 05:02:12.050 align:start position:0%
before
so

05:02:12.050 --> 05:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:02:15.050 --> 05:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
so I I do have your your sheet on the
 
05:02:17.708 --> 05:02:17.718 align:start position:0%
Manpower and and so when I look at page
 
05:02:22.490 --> 05:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh 876 number of positions I guess
 
05:02:25.190 --> 05:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's the office of the director
 
05:02:28.490 --> 05:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
um there's a plus-up of of eight in
 
05:02:28.500 --> 05:02:29.990 align:start position:0%
um there's a plus-up of of eight in
there

05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:02:31.910 --> 05:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
um am I supposed to see that on this
 
05:02:35.270 --> 05:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
sheet somewhere yes so so if you turn to
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
Au 2956 the yellow highlighted box in
 
05:02:40.788 --> 05:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
the top left there we have the three
 
05:02:43.310 --> 05:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
positions transferred from 295 seven the
 
05:02:46.850 --> 05:02:46.860 align:start position:0%
two from 2960 the one from 7905 and then
 
05:02:49.368 --> 05:02:49.378 align:start position:0%
the two temporary and when we say nine T
 
05:02:51.470 --> 05:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're the temporary full-time
 
05:02:54.170 --> 05:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
positions that were converted so so that
 
05:02:56.330 --> 05:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
that is your eight
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay because I I count
 
05:03:03.410 --> 05:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
I count three two one I think that's six
 
05:03:06.170 --> 05:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
but I'm seeing eight
 
05:03:08.270 --> 05:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm not I'm not I'm not trying
 
05:03:09.890 --> 05:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
to Sharp shoot it I'm just trying to
 
05:03:11.750 --> 05:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand the numbers and
 
05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
and then if you look at page 876
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
um under Office of the director
 
05:03:18.770 --> 05:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
accounting unit two nine five six down
 
05:03:20.868 --> 05:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of that page you'll see
 
05:03:22.670 --> 05:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
the state fiscal year 23 adjusted
 
05:03:24.770 --> 05:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
authorized you'll see the 27 positions
 
05:03:28.368 --> 05:03:28.378 align:start position:0%
and then in 24 and 25 you see the total
 
05:03:31.310 --> 05:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
35 positions right so that's that's plus
 
05:03:33.110 --> 05:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
eight right yes
 
05:03:37.250 --> 05:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
so I see a plus six under Au 2956 I
 
05:03:39.948 --> 05:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
don't see plus eight so there's there's
 
05:03:41.570 --> 05:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
the the six positions that you
 
05:03:44.330 --> 05:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
identified plus the two conversions so
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
that those so six plus two and then we
 
05:03:48.650 --> 05:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
have those two conversions becoming new
 
05:03:50.810 --> 05:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
authorized oh so the conversions aren't
 
05:03:52.190 --> 05:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
on this sheet
 
05:03:55.510 --> 05:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
yes they're they're they're right there
 
05:03:58.190 --> 05:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
the 290 conversions
 
05:03:58.200 --> 05:04:00.288 align:start position:0%
the 290 conversions
oh

05:04:00.288 --> 05:04:00.298 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:04:00.298 --> 05:04:02.570 align:start position:0%
oh
okay

05:04:02.570 --> 05:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:04:04.190 --> 05:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
they are there
 
05:04:07.850 --> 05:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
so two what is the nine one what's the
 
05:04:09.470 --> 05:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
nine one mean
 
05:04:11.930 --> 05:04:11.940 align:start position:0%
is that a nine one my eyes aren't the
 
05:04:17.150 --> 05:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
nine t en nine T yeah it's it's a Tango
 
05:04:21.470 --> 05:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh temporary but yeah it's it's it's a
 
05:04:23.628 --> 05:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
common uh nomenclature that that's right
 
05:04:26.330 --> 05:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
I'm just using the all right I I can now
 
05:04:28.010 --> 05:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
read your chart and and the numbers
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
crosswalk thank you excellent
 
05:04:32.810 --> 05:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
um the office of the director is is
 
05:04:32.820 --> 05:04:34.430 align:start position:0%
um the office of the director is is
primarily

05:04:34.430 --> 05:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
primarily
 
05:04:34.440 --> 05:04:35.090 align:start position:0%
primarily
um

05:04:35.090 --> 05:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:37.490 --> 05:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
as you'll see it's it's it's primarily
 
05:04:40.610 --> 05:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits is the key driver
 
05:04:44.090 --> 05:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
um behind that and when you look at the
 
05:04:47.628 --> 05:04:47.638 align:start position:0%
the the total funding for 24
 
05:04:51.288 --> 05:04:51.298 align:start position:0%
um it is uh about 30 federal funds 60
 
05:04:54.410 --> 05:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
General funds just so so in general
 
05:04:59.150 --> 05:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
we've got a A plus up in overhead and I
 
05:05:01.190 --> 05:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
know nobody likes to hear it like that
 
05:05:04.128 --> 05:05:04.138 align:start position:0%
but so can you explain what the value
 
05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:11.570 --> 05:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
I I'll defer to to Joe on on the
 
05:05:13.190 --> 05:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
rationale behind centralizing those
 
05:05:13.200 --> 05:05:15.530 align:start position:0%
rationale behind centralizing those
positions

05:05:15.530 --> 05:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
positions
 
05:05:18.110 --> 05:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
so these are mostly transfers from other
 
05:05:20.930 --> 05:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
parts of the division into
 
05:05:24.050 --> 05:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
um Supervision in this so our chief
 
05:05:25.730 --> 05:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
legal officer
 
05:05:28.250 --> 05:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
um who reports to me now oversees our
 
05:05:29.628 --> 05:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
policy development which I don't think
 
05:05:31.310 --> 05:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
was true in the last biennium so those
 
05:05:34.070 --> 05:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
positions moved over also oversees the
 
05:05:35.750 --> 05:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
central registry that's the registry for
 
05:05:37.788 --> 05:05:37.798 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect so those positions
 
05:05:39.288 --> 05:05:39.298 align:start position:0%
moved over so really it was a round
 
05:05:41.750 --> 05:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
moving folks under the supervision of a
 
05:05:44.270 --> 05:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
new person so we're not taking anyone
 
05:05:47.990 --> 05:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
out of direct Client Services these were
 
05:05:49.550 --> 05:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
roles that already existed that were
 
05:05:51.830 --> 05:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
just situated elsewhere in the division
 
05:05:53.510 --> 05:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
that we just moved under a different
 
05:05:57.708 --> 05:05:57.718 align:start position:0%
leader okay all right got it
 
05:06:01.250 --> 05:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
excellent if you turn to page 877 of the
 
05:06:03.590 --> 05:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget there is
 
05:06:07.330 --> 05:06:07.340 align:start position:0%
the the child protection account
 
05:06:10.368 --> 05:06:10.378 align:start position:0%
that you will see in the class 10 you
 
05:06:13.010 --> 05:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
will see a higher than than I guess what
 
05:06:16.368 --> 05:06:16.378 align:start position:0%
you would expect to be increase in the
 
05:06:17.990 --> 05:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
class 10 line there and and then
 
05:06:20.448 --> 05:06:20.458 align:start position:0%
concurrently with the benefits but what
 
05:06:22.670 --> 05:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing there earlier when
 
05:06:26.270 --> 05:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
Joe was was referencing the enhancements
 
05:06:28.250 --> 05:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
um these that is that is the cost
 
05:06:30.410 --> 05:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
associated with those enhancements for
 
05:06:32.930 --> 05:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
the child protective service workers and
 
05:06:35.150 --> 05:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
the supervisors um and that's what
 
05:06:36.770 --> 05:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
you're seeing show up in that class 10
 
05:06:36.780 --> 05:06:38.390 align:start position:0%
you're seeing show up in that class 10
line

05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:06:38.400 --> 05:06:40.330 align:start position:0%
line
um

05:06:40.330 --> 05:06:40.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:42.530 --> 05:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know if are there any other
 
05:06:44.448 --> 05:06:44.458 align:start position:0%
specific questions about the numbers for
 
05:06:44.458 --> 05:06:46.070 align:start position:0%
specific questions about the numbers for
2957

05:06:46.070 --> 05:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
2957
 
05:06:46.080 --> 05:06:47.330 align:start position:0%
2957
okay

05:06:47.330 --> 05:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:06:49.788 --> 05:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
so can we get to the domestic violence
 
05:06:52.970 --> 05:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
programs on the 2959 I don't think
 
05:06:55.490 --> 05:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
that's in your budget book but it's on
 
05:06:57.470 --> 05:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
page 879
 
05:07:07.030 --> 05:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
are we going to have domestic violence
 
05:07:13.368 --> 05:07:13.378 align:start position:0%
program on another day or so there is it
 
05:07:15.410 --> 05:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
there's a they do show up in a later
 
05:07:17.150 --> 05:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
slide under the bureau that oversees
 
05:07:18.530 --> 05:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
that work if we want to talk about it
 
05:07:20.208 --> 05:07:20.218 align:start position:0%
then or if we want to move to that way I
 
05:07:23.208 --> 05:07:23.218 align:start position:0%
just got a short question I uh under
 
05:07:26.390 --> 05:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
area or excuse me agency income I see
 
05:07:31.970 --> 05:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
federal state and 22 I see 523 thousand
 
05:07:35.208 --> 05:07:35.218 align:start position:0%
dollars that goes to zero what happened
 
05:07:37.610 --> 05:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
to the other funds I know these are
 
05:07:39.230 --> 05:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
these have at least three different
 
05:07:41.930 --> 05:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
other funds that feed them where's that
 
05:07:44.690 --> 05:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:47.448 --> 05:07:47.458 align:start position:0%
it's got two types of marriage licensure
 
05:07:50.090 --> 05:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
and it's got the domestic violence
 
05:07:52.550 --> 05:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
surcharge of fifty dollars
 
05:07:52.560 --> 05:07:53.690 align:start position:0%
surcharge of fifty dollars
yeah

05:07:53.690 --> 05:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:07:53.700 --> 05:07:58.910 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

05:07:58.910 --> 05:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:01.128 --> 05:08:01.138 align:start position:0%
part of my commitment to these folks was
 
05:08:03.410 --> 05:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
to protect that
 
05:08:06.650 --> 05:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
those other sources of revenue and I
 
05:08:09.530 --> 05:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
don't see them yeah so so this this
 
05:08:12.170 --> 05:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
account is funded through a variety of
 
05:08:12.180 --> 05:08:13.250 align:start position:0%
account is funded through a variety of
funds

05:08:13.250 --> 05:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
funds
 
05:08:14.868 --> 05:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
um we receive fifty dollars from
 
05:08:16.490 --> 05:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
Joshua's Law
 
05:08:18.830 --> 05:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
and I believe it's a domestic violence
 
05:08:23.448 --> 05:08:23.458 align:start position:0%
surcharge yes yep and I would I would
 
05:08:25.670 --> 05:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
have to go back to get an answer for you
 
05:08:28.070 --> 05:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
on that the other one is from marriage
 
05:08:30.288 --> 05:08:30.298 align:start position:0%
licenses it gets a big percentage of the
 
05:08:32.208 --> 05:08:32.218 align:start position:0%
marriage license and it gets a big a
 
05:08:34.368 --> 05:08:34.378 align:start position:0%
much bigger percentage of the officiate
 
05:08:37.010 --> 05:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
marriage officiate license correct and
 
05:08:39.770 --> 05:08:39.780 align:start position:0%
and all those are pretty strong sources
 
05:08:40.910 --> 05:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
of revenue
 
05:08:44.030 --> 05:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
and it says zero in the budget so I'm
 
05:08:46.310 --> 05:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
just curious well what do they want it
 
05:08:49.250 --> 05:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
that's the adjusted authorized um I I
 
05:08:50.690 --> 05:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
would have to go back and and look at
 
05:08:52.310 --> 05:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
the history behind why that adjusted
 
05:08:54.770 --> 05:08:54.780 align:start position:0%
authorizes zero I think we hit a bill
 
05:08:56.930 --> 05:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
last year to say stop taking it away
 
05:08:59.440 --> 05:08:59.450 align:start position:0%
from marriage licenses
 
05:08:59.450 --> 05:09:00.550 align:start position:0%
from marriage licenses
[Music]

05:09:00.550 --> 05:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:09:03.350 --> 05:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
I sponsored that bill and it did not
 
05:09:03.360 --> 05:09:04.490 align:start position:0%
I sponsored that bill and it did not
pass

05:09:04.490 --> 05:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:09:07.368 --> 05:09:07.378 align:start position:0%
information so and and while we were
 
05:09:09.470 --> 05:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
having that debate I promised that I
 
05:09:11.090 --> 05:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
wasn't coming after their money right
 
05:09:13.310 --> 05:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
but now that it's gone I want to make
 
05:09:18.708 --> 05:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:18.718 --> 05:09:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:09:19.430 --> 05:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:09:23.810 --> 05:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
um so uh Rebecca Lorden Finance director
 
05:09:27.350 --> 05:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
um so this is the special officiant and
 
05:09:29.868 --> 05:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
that law was new so we hadn't budgeted
 
05:09:33.170 --> 05:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
anything but we were earning um Revenue
 
05:09:36.170 --> 05:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
so this is uh fiscal year 23 so we
 
05:09:38.330 --> 05:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
currently are earning Revenue in that
 
05:09:41.030 --> 05:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
category but we just didn't budget any
 
05:09:43.850 --> 05:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
estimated Revenue yet
 
05:09:45.650 --> 05:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
it was something that came in the middle
 
05:09:49.610 --> 05:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
of the um biennium but okay so I'll buy
 
05:09:51.910 --> 05:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
that on the officiant
 
05:09:54.110 --> 05:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
but there is the other marriage license
 
05:09:56.208 --> 05:09:56.218 align:start position:0%
money that's been there for years and
 
05:09:58.910 --> 05:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
years so it should be in that line
 
05:10:00.890 --> 05:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
yes and that's why there's three
 
05:10:03.230 --> 05:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
different agency incomes
 
05:10:05.930 --> 05:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
there's one for the marriage license one
 
05:10:07.788 --> 05:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
for the Joshua law and one for the
 
05:10:10.250 --> 05:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
officiant yes ma'am yes so it's still
 
05:10:18.590 --> 05:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:22.010 --> 05:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
one is the Joshua law the zero zero
 
05:10:26.990 --> 05:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:30.910 --> 05:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
that was the question I was asking
 
05:10:33.890 --> 05:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
no it's it's on the same page it's just
 
05:10:36.708 --> 05:10:36.718 align:start position:0%
a higher line
 
05:10:39.530 --> 05:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
so so which one of those is the uh
 
05:10:39.540 --> 05:10:41.150 align:start position:0%
so so which one of those is the uh
Joshua

05:10:41.150 --> 05:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
Joshua
 
05:10:44.810 --> 05:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:49.550 --> 05:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
okay so you you educated me thank you
 
05:10:51.230 --> 05:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative hole did you have a
 
05:10:55.150 --> 05:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:55.160 --> 05:10:56.810 align:start position:0%
 
excellent

05:10:56.810 --> 05:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
05:10:56.820 --> 05:11:01.810 align:start position:0%
excellent
okay

05:11:01.810 --> 05:11:01.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:04.730 --> 05:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
so if this is a topic for another day
 
05:11:06.410 --> 05:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
like you had intended to talk about it
 
05:11:08.570 --> 05:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
you can take it off of that list we just
 
05:11:10.610 --> 05:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
talked about it I think okay
 
05:11:16.128 --> 05:11:16.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:20.628 --> 05:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
so we were on 290 2957 previously uh
 
05:11:22.730 --> 05:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
turn in page 878 Child and Family
 
05:11:22.740 --> 05:11:24.050 align:start position:0%
turn in page 878 Child and Family
Services

05:11:24.050 --> 05:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
Services
 
05:11:27.410 --> 05:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know if if the committee has
 
05:11:27.420 --> 05:11:29.628 align:start position:0%
I don't know if if the committee has
questions

05:11:29.628 --> 05:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:11:36.830 --> 05:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:39.170 --> 05:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to have questions until we
 
05:11:42.830 --> 05:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
get to page 893 I just want to look at
 
05:11:47.570 --> 05:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
the positions the 107 positions okay
 
05:11:49.850 --> 05:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
um but just because I'm rushing through
 
05:11:52.730 --> 05:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
that does not mean other reps should
 
05:11:54.410 --> 05:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
rush through
 
05:11:56.330 --> 05:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
if you end up with questions in between
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:04.970 --> 05:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
were there any questions
 
05:12:07.510 --> 05:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
um so we covered the domestic violence
 
05:12:10.610 --> 05:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
program or let me see here we covered
 
05:12:10.620 --> 05:12:11.990 align:start position:0%
program or let me see here we covered
that

05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:12:13.788 --> 05:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
um on page 880 the governor's
 
05:12:15.788 --> 05:12:15.798 align:start position:0%
recommended budget we have
 
05:12:18.110 --> 05:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
Organization for Learning and quality
 
05:12:20.628 --> 05:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
management and and this accounting unit
 
05:12:23.330 --> 05:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
was actually broken up into three or
 
05:12:25.250 --> 05:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
sorry two accounting units three two two
 
05:12:28.128 --> 05:12:28.138 align:start position:0%
zero and three two two one
 
05:12:31.970 --> 05:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
um and on the on the document in front
 
05:12:34.550 --> 05:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
of you you will see down at the bottom
 
05:12:37.810 --> 05:12:37.820 align:start position:0%
left the 2960 accounting unit
 
05:12:40.128 --> 05:12:40.138 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll see the positions that
 
05:12:43.368 --> 05:12:43.378 align:start position:0%
were moved to the two of the new seven
 
05:12:45.110 --> 05:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
and eight were moved to two of the new
 
05:12:46.850 --> 05:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
accounting units then three of the
 
05:12:48.368 --> 05:12:48.378 align:start position:0%
positions were moved to two other
 
05:12:51.230 --> 05:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
accounting units as well
 
05:12:52.970 --> 05:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
um and those those funds were
 
05:12:58.610 --> 05:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:01.190 --> 05:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
on page 881 there's the Foster Care
 
05:13:02.628 --> 05:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
Health Program
 
05:13:04.628 --> 05:13:04.638 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's any questions
 
05:13:08.330 --> 05:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
there we did have a lower spend in FY 22
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
primarily due to vacancies that we were
 
05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:19.250 --> 05:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
on page 882 there's the unemployment
 
05:13:23.090 --> 05:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
compensation nothing too exciting there
 
05:13:25.730 --> 05:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
um page 883 there's the child Wells
 
05:13:29.030 --> 05:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
child welfare service
 
05:13:30.170 --> 05:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there's any questions
 
05:13:30.180 --> 05:13:33.350 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there's any questions
there

05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:33.360 --> 05:13:34.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:13:34.490 --> 05:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:13:39.050 --> 05:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
uh page 884 uh there's the accounting
 
05:13:42.650 --> 05:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
unit 260 or excuse me 2969 Child Abuse
 
05:13:45.470 --> 05:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
Prevention capta if there are any
 
05:13:48.430 --> 05:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
questions there I'm just
 
05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
three sentences yep what do we try to do
 
05:13:56.570 --> 05:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
under the guise of Child Abuse
 
05:14:01.990 --> 05:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:05.868 --> 05:14:05.878 align:start position:0%
so if you look at class 102 that is for
 
05:14:08.830 --> 05:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
an M ladak contract
 
05:14:14.030 --> 05:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
sure so the M laida contract is to have
 
05:14:15.410 --> 05:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
um Master's level drug and alcohol
 
05:14:17.690 --> 05:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
counselors co-locating district offices
 
05:14:19.430 --> 05:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
to work with families who have substance
 
05:14:21.350 --> 05:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
use disorders and to work with our staff
 
05:14:22.730 --> 05:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
in helping understand how to navigate
 
05:14:24.948 --> 05:14:24.958 align:start position:0%
those issues with our kids
 
05:14:28.010 --> 05:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
um but the capta grant funds a couple
 
05:14:29.628 --> 05:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
different things one of them is that
 
05:14:31.310 --> 05:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
Community Navigator program that I spoke
 
05:14:33.110 --> 05:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
about before
 
05:14:35.270 --> 05:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
um it funds I I'm off the top of my head
 
05:14:36.470 --> 05:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not remembering home but it funds
 
05:14:37.970 --> 05:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
different activities a host of different
 
05:14:40.430 --> 05:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
activities like that support for you
 
05:14:41.930 --> 05:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
know Family Resource Centers and things
 
05:14:42.910 --> 05:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
like that
 
05:14:45.590 --> 05:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
in order to try to you know try to help
 
05:14:47.390 --> 05:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
meet kids needs in the community before
 
05:14:50.208 --> 05:14:50.218 align:start position:0%
they come to us as a state we do a lot
 
05:14:51.948 --> 05:14:51.958 align:start position:0%
of things I'm just not sure which ones
 
05:14:53.090 --> 05:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
are funded through this grant versus
 
05:14:54.590 --> 05:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
other sources right the kinship
 
05:14:56.208 --> 05:14:56.218 align:start position:0%
Navigator programs I spoke about Family
 
05:14:58.550 --> 05:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers I spoke about the
 
05:15:00.230 --> 05:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
community Navigator program that I spoke
 
05:15:02.448 --> 05:15:02.458 align:start position:0%
about frankly in my view the entire
 
05:15:04.190 --> 05:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
system of care as a prevention activity
 
05:15:05.628 --> 05:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
because anything that you're doing to
 
05:15:07.250 --> 05:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
get kids and families the help that they
 
05:15:08.990 --> 05:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
need so they don't come to us the
 
05:15:10.850 --> 05:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
deepest end of the system in my view
 
05:15:12.890 --> 05:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
this isn't about the kids with needs
 
05:15:14.690 --> 05:15:14.700 align:start position:0%
this is about parents with problems
 
05:15:17.030 --> 05:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
right both that's a different problem
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's both though I I would say that it's
 
05:15:22.850 --> 05:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
both right because you have the way that
 
05:15:24.830 --> 05:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
the system of care works it recognizes
 
05:15:27.110 --> 05:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
that kids are within families and that
 
05:15:28.490 --> 05:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a strong family unit
 
05:15:29.868 --> 05:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
that understands how to manage those
 
05:15:32.270 --> 05:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
kids needs that you can't actually have
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
a healthy outcome for that young person
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
right so key component of the system of
 
05:15:37.610 --> 05:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
care is peer support for the families
 
05:15:38.930 --> 05:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
who are engaged in it to help the
 
05:15:39.948 --> 05:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
families figure out how to navigate
 
05:15:42.470 --> 05:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
things like multi-systemic therapy that
 
05:15:44.208 --> 05:15:44.218 align:start position:0%
I spoke about earlier it's really around
 
05:15:46.250 --> 05:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
helping caregivers learn how to help
 
05:15:47.868 --> 05:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
manage their kids Behavioral Health
 
05:15:49.788 --> 05:15:49.798 align:start position:0%
needs and redirect them and help help
 
05:15:52.010 --> 05:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
them have healthier outcomes so these
 
05:15:53.690 --> 05:15:53.700 align:start position:0%
things are yes about families and about
 
05:15:55.910 --> 05:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
parents and they're about kids because
 
05:15:59.170 --> 05:15:59.180 align:start position:0%
kids don't function without families
 
05:16:02.030 --> 05:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll come off it I'm just curious
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
how we tell an adult don't beat your
 
05:16:05.040 --> 05:16:06.530 align:start position:0%
how we tell an adult don't beat your
kids

05:16:06.530 --> 05:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
kids
 
05:16:09.708 --> 05:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
um and do that in an effective way I I'm
 
05:16:11.330 --> 05:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
just curious what that program does
 
05:16:14.090 --> 05:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
really yeah I mean so teaching people
 
05:16:18.730 --> 05:16:18.740 align:start position:0%
appropriate and safe and and healthy
 
05:16:21.110 --> 05:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
but that's so that's a key component of
 
05:16:22.250 --> 05:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
the Healthy Families America program
 
05:16:23.868 --> 05:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
that I spoke about before right helping
 
05:16:25.610 --> 05:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
teach parents how to how to
 
05:16:27.170 --> 05:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
appropriately discipline and get get
 
05:16:28.910 --> 05:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
Behavior changes from their children in
 
05:16:30.948 --> 05:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
order to reach the outcomes so the
 
05:16:32.270 --> 05:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
Healthy Families America home visiting
 
05:16:34.010 --> 05:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
program Youth Villages intercept program
 
05:16:35.628 --> 05:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
those are all key parts of that we have
 
05:16:37.010 --> 05:16:37.020 align:start position:0%
other programs called parent health
 
05:16:38.448 --> 05:16:38.458 align:start position:0%
support that go in and do that type of
 
05:16:40.070 --> 05:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
work with family and we're still all
 
05:16:40.080 --> 05:16:41.530 align:start position:0%
work with family and we're still all
involuntary

05:16:41.530 --> 05:16:41.540 align:start position:0%
involuntary
 
05:16:43.970 --> 05:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
relationships between the families and
 
05:16:46.430 --> 05:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
the state or at what point are we in the
 
05:16:49.010 --> 05:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
market right so the Healthy Families
 
05:16:51.050 --> 05:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
America program is is a voluntary
 
05:16:51.060 --> 05:16:51.890 align:start position:0%
America program is is a voluntary
program

05:16:51.890 --> 05:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:16:53.510 --> 05:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
but the intercept program that I
 
05:16:54.890 --> 05:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned is a program that gets put
 
05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
into place when there's an open child
 
05:16:58.910 --> 05:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
protection case so that could be in a
 
05:17:00.770 --> 05:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
voluntary open child protection case or
 
05:17:02.090 --> 05:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
it could be in a court involved Child
 
05:17:03.890 --> 05:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
Protection case but the program is the
 
05:17:05.868 --> 05:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
same based on the underlying need okay
 
05:17:08.628 --> 05:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
that that tells me what did you
 
05:17:10.010 --> 05:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
represent an ordering do you have a
 
05:17:10.020 --> 05:17:10.970 align:start position:0%
represent an ordering do you have a
question

05:17:10.970 --> 05:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:17:13.730 --> 05:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
stream yeah I I actually want to go back
 
05:17:16.250 --> 05:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
to 2961 before jumping ahead just one
 
05:17:19.310 --> 05:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
question on uh on what does the audit
 
05:17:23.570 --> 05:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
fund set aside uh represent or how does
 
05:17:24.590 --> 05:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
that come out and how does it get
 
05:17:27.590 --> 05:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
resolved yep so so you will see audit
 
05:17:29.330 --> 05:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
funds set aside in a number of our
 
05:17:31.490 --> 05:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
accounts and um the department of
 
05:17:33.350 --> 05:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
administrative Services tells every
 
05:17:35.208 --> 05:17:35.218 align:start position:0%
state agency for the federal dollars
 
05:17:37.490 --> 05:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
that we receive you need to set aside
 
05:17:40.310 --> 05:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
point one percent of those dollars for
 
05:17:42.470 --> 05:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
audit related purposes and then those
 
05:17:47.208 --> 05:17:47.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:50.208 --> 05:17:50.218 align:start position:0%
and then to tie that in representative
 
05:17:52.970 --> 05:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
Weiler chairs a committee that
 
05:17:55.368 --> 05:17:55.378 align:start position:0%
establishes which audits get conducted
 
05:17:59.030 --> 05:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
and so I think that money pays for those
 
05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
money goes to the LBA
 
05:18:04.610 --> 05:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
to going on at these they have they have
 
05:18:06.650 --> 05:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
a regular series they do like every five
 
05:18:09.530 --> 05:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
years on every agency and then if if
 
05:18:11.448 --> 05:18:11.458 align:start position:0%
there's something that they think needs
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
a performance on it that's another
 
05:18:15.110 --> 05:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
higher a little bit higher level a
 
05:18:17.150 --> 05:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
little more thorough and and this
 
05:18:18.890 --> 05:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
committee decides which ones get
 
05:18:21.708 --> 05:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
performance audits
 
05:18:21.718 --> 05:18:22.910 align:start position:0%
performance audits
question

05:18:22.910 --> 05:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:18:24.730 --> 05:18:24.740 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind
 
05:18:27.050 --> 05:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
aren't these audits specifically the
 
05:18:29.810 --> 05:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
ones for the federal government
 
05:18:32.510 --> 05:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
the the the funds that are set aside are
 
05:18:33.830 --> 05:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
federal funds used for the federal
 
05:18:36.708 --> 05:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
government so like kpmj that contracts
 
05:18:38.930 --> 05:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
with the state LBA pays keep you know
 
05:18:40.850 --> 05:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
they they pay them
 
05:18:42.830 --> 05:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
um through that the the legislative
 
05:18:44.810 --> 05:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
performance audits I I would have to
 
05:18:46.550 --> 05:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
defer to the LBA on the budget there but
 
05:18:48.530 --> 05:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
my assumption would be that would be
 
05:18:50.930 --> 05:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
separately separate Appropriations to
 
05:18:52.730 --> 05:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
the you know to the legislature I mean
 
05:18:54.110 --> 05:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
the idea here is they're auditing for
 
05:18:55.250 --> 05:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
the federal government to prove that
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
we're spending federal funds properly
 
05:18:58.550 --> 05:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
yes things single about it there's a
 
05:19:00.890 --> 05:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
single audit for all of federal funds so
 
05:19:06.890 --> 05:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:06.900 --> 05:19:08.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:19:08.030 --> 05:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:19:09.470 --> 05:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
um teen Independent Living is at the
 
05:19:11.810 --> 05:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
bottom of page 884.
 
05:19:14.448 --> 05:19:14.458 align:start position:0%
um you you will see on page 885 a pretty
 
05:19:16.670 --> 05:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
significant decrease
 
05:19:18.708 --> 05:19:18.718 align:start position:0%
um in the contract line those were covid
 
05:19:21.050 --> 05:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
funds one-time coveted dollars that will
 
05:19:24.128 --> 05:19:24.138 align:start position:0%
not show up in the upcoming biennium
 
05:19:29.930 --> 05:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
the uh 2971 on page 885 uh relatively
 
05:19:31.910 --> 05:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
small dollar amount there I don't know
 
05:19:34.730 --> 05:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:34.740 --> 05:19:36.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:19:36.650 --> 05:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:19:40.788 --> 05:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
um on page 886 there's accounting unit
 
05:19:40.798 --> 05:19:42.708 align:start position:0%
um on page 886 there's accounting unit
2972

05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
2972
 
05:19:44.810 --> 05:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's any questions this
 
05:19:46.430 --> 05:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
is primarily for housing employment life
 
05:19:46.440 --> 05:19:49.250 align:start position:0%
is primarily for housing employment life
skills

05:19:49.250 --> 05:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:49.260 --> 05:19:50.330 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:19:50.330 --> 05:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:19:53.270 --> 05:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
on page 8887 promoting safe stable
 
05:19:53.280 --> 05:19:54.650 align:start position:0%
on page 8887 promoting safe stable
families

05:19:54.650 --> 05:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
families
 
05:19:58.910 --> 05:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh accounting unit sorry like uh
 
05:19:58.920 --> 05:19:59.810 align:start position:0%
uh accounting unit sorry like uh
yeah

05:19:59.810 --> 05:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:20:02.208 --> 05:20:02.218 align:start position:0%
I apologize beginning on page 86 there's
 
05:20:04.310 --> 05:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
promoting safe Stables families this is
 
05:20:07.368 --> 05:20:07.378 align:start position:0%
a this is a federal award that we
 
05:20:07.378 --> 05:20:09.128 align:start position:0%
a this is a federal award that we
receive

05:20:09.128 --> 05:20:09.138 align:start position:0%
receive
 
05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
I have just a general question in this
 
05:20:16.610 --> 05:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
area Okay so a lot of this is our
 
05:20:18.890 --> 05:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
services that we contract out
 
05:20:22.190 --> 05:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure as part of our our contract
 
05:20:24.530 --> 05:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
work we make sure that there are metrics
 
05:20:26.150 --> 05:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
in place so that we know that they're
 
05:20:28.310 --> 05:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
delivering on the contract that we've
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
done with them
 
05:20:32.750 --> 05:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
do we have clawbacks if we give them
 
05:20:34.910 --> 05:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
performance measures and they end up
 
05:20:36.530 --> 05:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
because they end up having the same
 
05:20:38.448 --> 05:20:38.458 align:start position:0%
problems the state does they can't find
 
05:20:41.390 --> 05:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
enough people to build the capacity to
 
05:20:44.208 --> 05:20:44.218 align:start position:0%
meet the contract do do we end up
 
05:20:46.550 --> 05:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
getting this money back or is it how
 
05:20:48.170 --> 05:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
does that work
 
05:20:48.180 --> 05:20:49.368 align:start position:0%
does that work
yeah

05:20:49.368 --> 05:20:49.378 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:20:51.670 --> 05:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
um many of our contracts are actually
 
05:20:54.170 --> 05:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
on not on a cost reimbursement model
 
05:20:55.368 --> 05:20:55.378 align:start position:0%
where we're paying them and then having
 
05:20:57.590 --> 05:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
to call back but it's on a per de it's
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
on like a per diem rate so a contract
 
05:21:01.670 --> 05:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
for a program like uh intercept that I
 
05:21:03.770 --> 05:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
spoke about before we're actually paying
 
05:21:05.750 --> 05:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
them only for the families that they
 
05:21:07.550 --> 05:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
serve and the contract has a ceiling
 
05:21:09.230 --> 05:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
that we can't exceed
 
05:21:10.970 --> 05:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
but they don't get they don't get paid
 
05:21:12.170 --> 05:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
for the families that they don't serve
 
05:21:13.368 --> 05:21:13.378 align:start position:0%
they only get paid for the jobs that
 
05:21:15.410 --> 05:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
they for the work that they do
 
05:21:18.830 --> 05:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
so so then that's good so what's your
 
05:21:21.890 --> 05:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
what's our experience been are are we
 
05:21:23.930 --> 05:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
hitting a hundred percent of the maximum
 
05:21:27.110 --> 05:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh are we hitting half of that what I
 
05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
know it probably varies by contract but
 
05:21:31.250 --> 05:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious how this Manpower
 
05:21:32.990 --> 05:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
problem is affecting our ability
 
05:21:35.868 --> 05:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
contract as well it's it's impacting the
 
05:21:37.610 --> 05:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
child welfare system and the children's
 
05:21:39.110 --> 05:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health System all the way
 
05:21:40.730 --> 05:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
across the board right so all those
 
05:21:42.050 --> 05:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
things that I just spoke through those
 
05:21:43.490 --> 05:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
key accomplishments
 
05:21:46.788 --> 05:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
um you know honestly I think we've built
 
05:21:49.730 --> 05:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
an awesome system for the state I think
 
05:21:51.230 --> 05:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
that when this is fully operational
 
05:21:53.030 --> 05:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
because we have our Workforce issues met
 
05:21:54.470 --> 05:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to be leading the country
 
05:21:57.050 --> 05:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
and in lots and lots of areas but right
 
05:21:59.150 --> 05:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
now at every single turn of the system
 
05:22:00.830 --> 05:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
there's a Workforce issue preventing us
 
05:22:02.570 --> 05:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
from kind of hitting on all cylinders
 
05:22:04.128 --> 05:22:04.138 align:start position:0%
right from the child protection
 
05:22:05.868 --> 05:22:05.878 align:start position:0%
investigator to the child protection
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
case worker to the sysc staff to the
 
05:22:10.788 --> 05:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
in-home provider agencies to the
 
05:22:12.530 --> 05:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
residential provider agencies to our
 
05:22:14.090 --> 05:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
Care Management entities at fast forward
 
05:22:15.890 --> 05:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
right this Workforce issue is hitting
 
05:22:18.890 --> 05:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
every single contract that we have and
 
05:22:21.650 --> 05:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
having us not actually meet kind of
 
05:22:24.050 --> 05:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
where we're designed to go because if
 
05:22:25.490 --> 05:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
there's not enough staff to do all that
 
05:22:25.500 --> 05:22:30.650 align:start position:0%
there's not enough staff to do all that
work

05:22:30.650 --> 05:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:32.810 --> 05:22:32.820 align:start position:0%
on page 887 there's the adoption
 
05:22:35.990 --> 05:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
services account 2974 that this pays for
 
05:22:38.150 --> 05:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
an adoption incentive I don't know if
 
05:22:41.750 --> 05:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:47.208 --> 05:22:47.218 align:start position:0%
page 888 account unit 3220 this is the
 
05:22:49.128 --> 05:22:49.138 align:start position:0%
Bureau of professional and strategic
 
05:22:51.288 --> 05:22:51.298 align:start position:0%
development and this is a new accounting
 
05:22:53.270 --> 05:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
unit this is resulting from
 
05:22:56.510 --> 05:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
from uh the the splitting up of the
 
05:22:59.510 --> 05:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 2960 I'm not sure if
 
05:23:01.190 --> 05:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's any contracts or any questions
 
05:23:01.200 --> 05:23:02.628 align:start position:0%
there's any contracts or any questions
there

05:23:02.628 --> 05:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:23:04.330 --> 05:23:04.340 align:start position:0%
oh yeah that's
 
05:23:07.250 --> 05:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
that's another one on your sheet adding
 
05:23:10.070 --> 05:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
people think yes yes that yes that that
 
05:23:11.330 --> 05:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
is correct
 
05:23:12.948 --> 05:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
um it's it's in the top right corner
 
05:23:15.410 --> 05:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
there you'll see the the 11 total
 
05:23:16.970 --> 05:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
positions that are being moved into this
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
looks like you're creating a whole new
 
05:23:25.970 --> 05:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
program for 24 and 25.
 
05:23:27.890 --> 05:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
yeah essentially what that was is we had
 
05:23:29.750 --> 05:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
one Bureau that was overseeing a host of
 
05:23:29.760 --> 05:23:31.368 align:start position:0%
one Bureau that was overseeing a host of
activities

05:23:31.368 --> 05:23:31.378 align:start position:0%
activities
 
05:23:32.690 --> 05:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
um and we decided that we wanted to
 
05:23:34.070 --> 05:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
structure it differently so we just
 
05:23:35.628 --> 05:23:35.638 align:start position:0%
we're moving some of them into this
 
05:23:36.770 --> 05:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
place and some of them into that place
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
but it's the same amount of staff
 
05:23:40.970 --> 05:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
um it was we had one Bureau that oversaw
 
05:23:42.890 --> 05:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
kind of our training our professional
 
05:23:44.750 --> 05:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
development work they also oversaw kind
 
05:23:46.490 --> 05:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
of our data work our federal reporting
 
05:23:47.868 --> 05:23:47.878 align:start position:0%
and we thought you know we needed
 
05:23:48.890 --> 05:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
different leaders for those two
 
05:23:50.510 --> 05:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
functions and broke them out into two
 
05:23:52.550 --> 05:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
separate but it's the same staff overall
 
05:23:53.868 --> 05:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
just a different organization you need
 
05:23:57.288 --> 05:23:57.298 align:start position:0%
to go to hb2 to reorganize all this
 
05:23:59.570 --> 05:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
was it a separate legislation
 
05:23:59.580 --> 05:24:00.850 align:start position:0%
was it a separate legislation
no

05:24:00.850 --> 05:24:00.860 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:24:02.868 --> 05:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
this is that this is down at the account
 
05:24:05.208 --> 05:24:05.218 align:start position:0%
Bureau level so I don't believe that is
 
05:24:06.830 --> 05:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
required it's an excellent question
 
05:24:06.840 --> 05:24:10.788 align:start position:0%
required it's an excellent question
though

05:24:10.788 --> 05:24:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:13.550 --> 05:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
um at the at the bottom of page 888 this
 
05:24:16.970 --> 05:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
is 3221 and this is another uh new
 
05:24:18.590 --> 05:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
accounting unit where we were taking
 
05:24:21.288 --> 05:24:21.298 align:start position:0%
eight positions from from the from the
 
05:24:24.110 --> 05:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
former 2960.
 
05:24:28.670 --> 05:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:28.680 --> 05:24:30.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:24:30.110 --> 05:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:24:33.650 --> 05:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
if you turn to page 890 this is Child
 
05:24:37.550 --> 05:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:42.310 --> 05:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
um so can I come back yes there on 888
 
05:24:45.470 --> 05:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
I'm reading Bureau of looks like
 
05:24:49.910 --> 05:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
professional and strategic development
 
05:24:52.850 --> 05:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
am I reading that right the Bureau of
 
05:24:59.050 --> 05:24:59.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:01.368 --> 05:25:01.378 align:start position:0%
is that a renaming of something that's
 
05:25:03.170 --> 05:25:03.180 align:start position:0%
yeah that's one of the new so we had one
 
05:25:04.850 --> 05:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
Bureau Bureau of organizational learning
 
05:25:04.860 --> 05:25:05.690 align:start position:0%
Bureau Bureau of organizational learning
and

05:25:05.690 --> 05:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:08.270 --> 05:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
quality improvement now it's Bureau of
 
05:25:10.128 --> 05:25:10.138 align:start position:0%
professional strategic development and
 
05:25:11.930 --> 05:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
Bureau of evaluation analytics and
 
05:25:14.690 --> 05:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
Reporting so it was one now it's two but
 
05:25:17.030 --> 05:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's the same staff just organized
 
05:25:18.890 --> 05:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
differently under different leadership
 
05:25:23.208 --> 05:25:23.218 align:start position:0%
much cooler title though okay all right
 
05:25:24.830 --> 05:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
well I think the folks really liked the
 
05:25:26.448 --> 05:25:26.458 align:start position:0%
Bureau of evaluation analytics and
 
05:25:28.670 --> 05:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
Reporting because the acronym of that is
 
05:25:28.680 --> 05:25:30.110 align:start position:0%
Reporting because the acronym of that is
bear

05:25:30.110 --> 05:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
bear
 
05:25:32.030 --> 05:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
so folks really really liked that and I
 
05:25:33.530 --> 05:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
had a different name for it I think it
 
05:25:34.970 --> 05:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
was reporting evaluation and something
 
05:25:36.830 --> 05:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
else and they came back to me and said
 
05:25:38.570 --> 05:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
no you have a terrible idea and bear is
 
05:25:40.850 --> 05:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
a much better name so don't don't poke
 
05:25:43.788 --> 05:25:43.798 align:start position:0%
the bear all right thanks
 
05:25:49.610 --> 05:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:51.770 --> 05:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
three two two one the one I think he was
 
05:25:53.690 --> 05:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
just talking about there's quite a big
 
05:25:57.288 --> 05:25:57.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:59.750 --> 05:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
in in three two two one three two two
 
05:26:02.090 --> 05:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
one am I reading that wrong so so that
 
05:26:05.150 --> 05:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
that is a new accounting unit yeah
 
05:26:05.160 --> 05:26:07.910 align:start position:0%
that is a new accounting unit yeah
um

05:26:07.910 --> 05:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:12.530 --> 05:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:16.368 --> 05:26:16.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:18.410 --> 05:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
oh for the whole something oh that's
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
child protect no and for child
 
05:26:19.920 --> 05:26:22.970 align:start position:0%
child protect no and for child
protection

05:26:22.970 --> 05:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:25.788 --> 05:26:25.798 align:start position:0%
so where it is
 
05:26:25.798 --> 05:26:30.170 align:start position:0%
so where it is
okay

05:26:30.170 --> 05:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:33.170 --> 05:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so so you you're looking at the
 
05:26:35.208 --> 05:26:35.218 align:start position:0%
uh the 79 million figure in state fiscal
 
05:26:38.570 --> 05:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
year 24 for General funds from the 73
 
05:26:41.448 --> 05:26:41.458 align:start position:0%
yeah and and earlier
 
05:26:43.368 --> 05:26:43.378 align:start position:0%
um you know what one of the one of the
 
05:26:45.410 --> 05:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
key drivers behind that you know was was
 
05:26:47.150 --> 05:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
the enhancements I I forget the
 
05:26:49.190 --> 05:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
accounting unit off the top of my head
 
05:26:51.050 --> 05:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
um but but that was one of the key
 
05:26:52.670 --> 05:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
primary drivers behind what you're
 
05:26:54.890 --> 05:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
seeing there okay so so this is the
 
05:26:56.270 --> 05:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
total for the whole department for his
 
05:27:00.310 --> 05:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:04.850 --> 05:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
yes for for that for for 42 10 10 for
 
05:27:07.010 --> 05:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
child protection yes but there are there
 
05:27:09.530 --> 05:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
are other accounts that are within dcyf
 
05:27:12.470 --> 05:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:15.470 --> 05:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
at the activity level
 
05:27:15.480 --> 05:27:17.930 align:start position:0%
at the activity level
okay

05:27:17.930 --> 05:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:17.940 --> 05:27:19.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:27:19.310 --> 05:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:27:19.320 --> 05:27:21.170 align:start position:0%
okay
um

05:27:21.170 --> 05:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:23.510 --> 05:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
all right and then if you skip ahead
 
05:27:27.970 --> 05:27:27.980 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry I'm a little slow again
 
05:27:31.730 --> 05:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
on page 888 for the Bureau of
 
05:27:34.430 --> 05:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
professional and strategic development
 
05:27:38.770 --> 05:27:38.780 align:start position:0%
up above on line zero seven zero
 
05:27:41.810 --> 05:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
in-state travel reimbursement
 
05:27:47.090 --> 05:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
am I right to be reading it's 513 024
 
05:27:53.448 --> 05:27:53.458 align:start position:0%
and 565 and 25 or yeah yes
 
05:27:56.570 --> 05:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
that's that's sounds like a lot of money
 
05:27:58.730 --> 05:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
for in-state travel
 
05:28:01.610 --> 05:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll let Joe speak to the the
 
05:28:04.190 --> 05:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
work that that his team does but it
 
05:28:07.010 --> 05:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
often involves uh going across the state
 
05:28:09.288 --> 05:28:09.298 align:start position:0%
uh two individuals homes on a regular
 
05:28:10.970 --> 05:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
basis so some of these people are out
 
05:28:13.368 --> 05:28:13.378 align:start position:0%
there almost every single day and then
 
05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
we reimburse them at the federal rate
 
05:28:17.448 --> 05:28:17.458 align:start position:0%
for their travel
 
05:28:20.390 --> 05:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
so they're going to people's homes are
 
05:28:22.128 --> 05:28:22.138 align:start position:0%
they going to employees go ahead let's
 
05:28:24.650 --> 05:28:24.660 align:start position:0%
go ahead Mr ribson yeah this is this is
 
05:28:26.270 --> 05:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
the travel related to training
 
05:28:29.030 --> 05:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
activities so when we have
 
05:28:31.128 --> 05:28:31.138 align:start position:0%
um new staff right they have to go
 
05:28:32.990 --> 05:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
through three months of training this is
 
05:28:34.310 --> 05:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
the travel costs that are associated
 
05:28:35.570 --> 05:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
with that the travel cost that Nathan
 
05:28:36.708 --> 05:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
was referring to or elsewhere in the
 
05:28:38.030 --> 05:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
budget for staff who are moving around
 
05:28:40.610 --> 05:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
visiting kids and things like that we
 
05:28:41.930 --> 05:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
actually don't have a fleet of State
 
05:28:43.910 --> 05:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
cars for our staff the way that you know
 
05:28:45.830 --> 05:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions do so we reimburse
 
05:28:45.840 --> 05:28:46.550 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions do so we reimburse
them

05:28:46.550 --> 05:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:28:48.410 --> 05:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
um mileage rates
 
05:28:50.990 --> 05:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
that three months is in person in
 
05:28:53.150 --> 05:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
Concord or something or much of it is
 
05:28:55.070 --> 05:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
some of it is remote but much of it's in
 
05:28:56.868 --> 05:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
person some of it's in Concord some of
 
05:28:58.970 --> 05:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
it's actually down on the sysc campus
 
05:29:00.050 --> 05:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
where we use some of those older
 
05:29:01.310 --> 05:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
buildings as kind of mock interview
 
05:29:03.170 --> 05:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
sites for you know a mock home
 
05:29:05.448 --> 05:29:05.458 align:start position:0%
inspection and things like that so there
 
05:29:07.670 --> 05:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
are different parts in the state but but
 
05:29:09.650 --> 05:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
yes a lot of it's in person a lot of it
 
05:29:12.050 --> 05:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
requires you know significant travel
 
05:29:15.230 --> 05:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
okay because I don't have a 22 and 23
 
05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
number to compare it to the numbers just
 
05:29:19.850 --> 05:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
jumping out at me
 
05:29:22.250 --> 05:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
um I I'm just going to ask the question
 
05:29:24.110 --> 05:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
have you all really looked at that hard
 
05:29:27.110 --> 05:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that in the post-pandemic
 
05:29:28.788 --> 05:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
era where we all zoom and everything
 
05:29:31.190 --> 05:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
that that we really need to be moving
 
05:29:34.250 --> 05:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
humans all over the state yeah you know
 
05:29:35.690 --> 05:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
some of the charts some of it is remote
 
05:29:37.730 --> 05:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
and during the pandemic almost all of it
 
05:29:40.368 --> 05:29:40.378 align:start position:0%
was remote but people have provided very
 
05:29:42.350 --> 05:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
strong feedback that in-person training
 
05:29:45.350 --> 05:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
is far superior to the to the zoom
 
05:29:45.360 --> 05:29:47.510 align:start position:0%
is far superior to the to the zoom
options

05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
options
 
05:29:50.270 --> 05:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
now just to quote a famous man I can't
 
05:29:52.010 --> 05:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
help but to think of who's zoom and ho
 
05:29:52.020 --> 05:29:58.690 align:start position:0%
help but to think of who's zoom and ho
but

05:29:58.690 --> 05:29:58.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:04.190 --> 05:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
sure if if you turn to page 893
 
05:30:06.170 --> 05:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
um we we pick up with accounting unit
 
05:30:10.490 --> 05:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
7905 this is juvenile Field Services
 
05:30:12.470 --> 05:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know if if there are are there
 
05:30:21.590 --> 05:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:25.970 --> 05:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
on page 894 there's ojjdp
 
05:30:29.750 --> 05:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
and and this is a um primarily what you
 
05:30:32.030 --> 05:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
see here is a is a Federal Grant
 
05:30:40.208 --> 05:30:40.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:45.590 --> 05:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
may I inquire what ojj the p is
 
05:30:48.650 --> 05:30:48.660 align:start position:0%
it's the federal office of Juvenile
 
05:30:51.170 --> 05:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
Justice and delinquency prevention thank
 
05:30:51.180 --> 05:30:53.570 align:start position:0%
Justice and delinquency prevention thank
you

05:30:53.570 --> 05:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:58.010 --> 05:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
and then on page 896 you will see the
 
05:30:59.990 --> 05:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
sunini Youth Services Center and as we
 
05:31:01.368 --> 05:31:01.378 align:start position:0%
already discussed for the current
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
biennium there was an hb2 provision
 
05:31:06.230 --> 05:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
funding the operations and uh you you
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
will see an appropriation uh in hb2 as
 
05:31:12.708 --> 05:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
well funding those operations can you
 
05:31:14.810 --> 05:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
give us a preview of coming attractions
 
05:31:17.270 --> 05:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
on hb2 what what what's that operational
 
05:31:19.910 --> 05:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
budget going to look like
 
05:31:21.890 --> 05:31:21.900 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
05:31:24.590 --> 05:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
a standard annual
 
05:31:28.368 --> 05:31:28.378 align:start position:0%
13 million dollar sure so the the
 
05:31:32.570 --> 05:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's included in or will
 
05:31:35.750 --> 05:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
be included in hb2 is 11.1 million
 
05:31:39.230 --> 05:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
dollars primarily of General funds in
 
05:31:43.310 --> 05:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 24 and 11.4 million in
 
05:31:46.208 --> 05:31:46.218 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 25 again primarily
 
05:31:49.070 --> 05:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
General funds in the past we did have
 
05:31:52.850 --> 05:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
more offset revenue from from kids
 
05:31:54.288 --> 05:31:54.298 align:start position:0%
coming from Vermont and they would pay
 
05:31:56.930 --> 05:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
us on a daily basis we really don't have
 
05:31:58.730 --> 05:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
that anymore so we don't have that
 
05:32:00.590 --> 05:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
roughly million dollars plus available
 
05:32:02.930 --> 05:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
so now it's primarily generally funds
 
05:32:05.930 --> 05:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
earlier I heard that we took 50
 
05:32:09.530 --> 05:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
positions away from here what what it
 
05:32:11.628 --> 05:32:11.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel like that had a huge impact
 
05:32:14.330 --> 05:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
on how much we're budgeting though
 
05:32:16.788 --> 05:32:16.798 align:start position:0%
yeah so they were actually unfunded
 
05:32:19.788 --> 05:32:19.798 align:start position:0%
positions right in previous biniums so
 
05:32:21.170 --> 05:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
they didn't they were positions that
 
05:32:22.490 --> 05:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
existed on the books but they were not
 
05:32:23.990 --> 05:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
positions that were funded in the budget
 
05:32:25.970 --> 05:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
so if you'll recall you know you've
 
05:32:27.288 --> 05:32:27.298 align:start position:0%
you've gone through this a couple times
 
05:32:29.868 --> 05:32:29.878 align:start position:0%
there's been multiple cuts to syc's
 
05:32:31.190 --> 05:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
budget over the years but there haven't
 
05:32:32.990 --> 05:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
been cut to the positions allocated to
 
05:32:34.970 --> 05:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
sysc at the same time so what would
 
05:32:36.770 --> 05:32:36.780 align:start position:0%
happen is positions would become
 
05:32:38.410 --> 05:32:38.420 align:start position:0%
unfunded to be able to meet those
 
05:32:40.910 --> 05:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
targets that were set through the budget
 
05:32:42.590 --> 05:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
process and those positions would end up
 
05:32:44.330 --> 05:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
living on the books kind of making
 
05:32:45.830 --> 05:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
people think that the Staffing numbers
 
05:32:47.030 --> 05:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
were a lot higher than they actually
 
05:32:49.128 --> 05:32:49.138 align:start position:0%
were and we wanted to clean that up so
 
05:32:51.530 --> 05:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
now that it's clean uh how many
 
05:32:54.650 --> 05:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
personnel do we think are authorized for
 
05:32:54.660 --> 05:32:56.090 align:start position:0%
personnel do we think are authorized for
sysc

05:32:56.090 --> 05:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
sysc
 
05:32:58.310 --> 05:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
it was somewhere around 85 I could be
 
05:33:00.708 --> 05:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
off by a couple
 
05:33:04.490 --> 05:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
87. how did you guys know 87 so fast
 
05:33:12.190 --> 05:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:14.990 --> 05:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
okay the positions are still listed in
 
05:33:17.750 --> 05:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
the HP one okay and and that's a
 
05:33:19.250 --> 05:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
function of the state's budget system
 
05:33:22.910 --> 05:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
you the positions have to show up there
 
05:33:26.330 --> 05:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
okay great did you have a question I do
 
05:33:29.330 --> 05:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you so of this 87 that's showing
 
05:33:29.340 --> 05:33:30.650 align:start position:0%
thank you so of this 87 that's showing
here

05:33:30.650 --> 05:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:33:32.930 --> 05:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
two questions first one is what
 
05:33:35.448 --> 05:33:35.458 align:start position:0%
positions are filled currently and what
 
05:33:37.310 --> 05:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
is needed to run the current facility
 
05:33:38.628 --> 05:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
where it's at
 
05:33:40.970 --> 05:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
so what's in what's what's in the budget
 
05:33:43.910 --> 05:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
that 87 is is what we think we need to
 
05:33:46.670 --> 05:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
fully run the current facility I'd have
 
05:33:48.530 --> 05:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
to double check back on what's actually
 
05:33:50.270 --> 05:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
filled right now my guess would be that
 
05:33:51.770 --> 05:33:51.780 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere in the
 
05:33:56.090 --> 05:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
probably total of 40 to 50ish Ballpark
 
05:33:57.948 --> 05:33:57.958 align:start position:0%
um that's not just front line staff but
 
05:33:59.990 --> 05:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's other positions right nutrition
 
05:34:02.390 --> 05:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance all those other things that
 
05:34:03.650 --> 05:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
happen at the facility the front line
 
05:34:05.208 --> 05:34:05.218 align:start position:0%
staff as we've talked about before I
 
05:34:08.150 --> 05:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
think are currently 17 on the books that
 
05:34:09.590 --> 05:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
are filled
 
05:34:11.390 --> 05:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
um so that's why I'm getting to we're
 
05:34:12.770 --> 05:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
probably somewhere around that 50 number
 
05:34:14.270 --> 05:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
but it could be a little bit less than
 
05:34:15.890 --> 05:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
that I can get you an exact number on
 
05:34:15.900 --> 05:34:16.610 align:start position:0%
that I can get you an exact number on
that

05:34:16.610 --> 05:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:34:16.620 --> 05:34:19.610 align:start position:0%
that
hmm

05:34:19.610 --> 05:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:22.250 --> 05:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
in earlier I think I saw the number six
 
05:34:25.730 --> 05:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
you have six new you correct me so you
 
05:34:28.368 --> 05:34:28.378 align:start position:0%
had six new clinicians to help you
 
05:34:31.730 --> 05:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
transition over to the therapeutic based
 
05:34:31.740 --> 05:34:32.690 align:start position:0%
transition over to the therapeutic based
model

05:34:32.690 --> 05:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
model
 
05:34:35.030 --> 05:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where you got that number
 
05:34:36.890 --> 05:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
six from but what we so the way the
 
05:34:38.810 --> 05:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
clinical programs design I'm remembering
 
05:34:40.970 --> 05:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
your text from earlier in the slide deck
 
05:34:42.708 --> 05:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's not six we have the way
 
05:34:44.750 --> 05:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
that the clinical program at sysc is now
 
05:34:46.910 --> 05:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
designed is we've actually eliminated
 
05:34:48.948 --> 05:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
the state staff clinical positions as
 
05:34:50.270 --> 05:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
part of the last
 
05:34:52.070 --> 05:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
reductions that happened after the last
 
05:34:53.690 --> 05:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
budget and we entered into a contract
 
05:34:55.910 --> 05:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
with Dartmouth for fewer licensed
 
05:34:58.010 --> 05:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
clinicians to support the facility So
 
05:35:01.368 --> 05:35:01.378 align:start position:0%
currently there is a a part-time 10-hour
 
05:35:03.170 --> 05:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
week psychiatrist that supports the
 
05:35:05.750 --> 05:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
facility a full-time psychologist and
 
05:35:09.830 --> 05:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:12.530 --> 05:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
so I've heard and I have believed that
 
05:35:15.650 --> 05:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
because of the instability of the sununu
 
05:35:18.590 --> 05:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
plan that we were running into trouble
 
05:35:21.770 --> 05:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
keeping folks from Trading
 
05:35:24.948 --> 05:35:24.958 align:start position:0%
if we're if we're relying on and I I
 
05:35:26.628 --> 05:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
knew this to be true I had forgotten
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
that we're really relying on Dartmouth
 
05:35:31.250 --> 05:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
to provide much of the professional
 
05:35:34.070 --> 05:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
support wouldn't they be pretty immune
 
05:35:37.070 --> 05:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
to all the tribulation we've undertaken
 
05:35:40.128 --> 05:35:40.138 align:start position:0%
and and shouldn't we have the ability
 
05:35:42.530 --> 05:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
already to be converting to a
 
05:35:45.470 --> 05:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
therapeutic based model so Dartmouth
 
05:35:47.810 --> 05:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
only provides those kind of licensed
 
05:35:50.390 --> 05:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
clinical level supports at sysc not the
 
05:35:51.948 --> 05:35:51.958 align:start position:0%
front line staff the front line staff
 
05:35:54.470 --> 05:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
for state employees so that includes as
 
05:35:56.090 --> 05:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
I said before 10 hours a week of a
 
05:35:58.788 --> 05:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist full-time psychologist two
 
05:36:00.830 --> 05:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
licensed full-time clinicians there's
 
05:36:02.448 --> 05:36:02.458 align:start position:0%
also a couple Physicians that come
 
05:36:03.770 --> 05:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
through the facility that check on the
 
05:36:05.810 --> 05:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
kids physical health I'm not even sure
 
05:36:07.430 --> 05:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
how many hours they they log but it's
 
05:36:08.750 --> 05:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know a couple hours a week a few
 
05:36:10.550 --> 05:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
hours a week those are all contracted
 
05:36:12.590 --> 05:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
through Dartmouth the other positions
 
05:36:15.650 --> 05:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
are State positions the front line youth
 
05:36:18.110 --> 05:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
counselors who do the primary day-to-day
 
05:36:21.050 --> 05:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
24 7 regular interaction with kids those
 
05:36:22.850 --> 05:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
are State positions not contracted with
 
05:36:22.860 --> 05:36:31.670 align:start position:0%
are State positions not contracted with
Dartmouth

05:36:31.670 --> 05:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:34.550 --> 05:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
so we've we've covered the the
 
05:36:36.830 --> 05:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
accounting unit level detail
 
05:36:40.730 --> 05:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
um and the the the presentation that
 
05:36:42.830 --> 05:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
that that Joe had
 
05:36:42.840 --> 05:36:43.368 align:start position:0%
that that Joe had
um

05:36:43.368 --> 05:36:43.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:46.128 --> 05:36:46.138 align:start position:0%
there there are a number of uh charts
 
05:36:48.410 --> 05:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
and performance uh indicators I don't
 
05:36:50.030 --> 05:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
know if you'd like to cover those now
 
05:36:51.708 --> 05:36:51.718 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a host of kind of data in
 
05:36:53.030 --> 05:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
here to kind of walk through so people
 
05:36:54.410 --> 05:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
can see what's happening within the
 
05:36:56.330 --> 05:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
system right now I'm more than happy to
 
05:36:58.368 --> 05:36:58.378 align:start position:0%
go through that although I also get the
 
05:37:00.530 --> 05:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
sense that folks are have had a long day
 
05:37:06.110 --> 05:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
so you advise I I um I'm gonna I'm gonna
 
05:37:09.470 --> 05:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
give division three like two minutes to
 
05:37:11.208 --> 05:37:11.218 align:start position:0%
flip through the graphs
 
05:37:16.368 --> 05:37:16.378 align:start position:0%
uh uh up through Page 20 and if you have
 
05:37:19.250 --> 05:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
any questions on any of the graphs we we
 
05:37:27.110 --> 05:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:29.810 --> 05:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
each graph is worth at least a thousand
 
05:37:54.770 --> 05:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:54.780 --> 05:37:56.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:37:56.470 --> 05:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:37:58.850 --> 05:37:58.860 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you a question I'm going to
 
05:38:04.250 --> 05:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:07.128 --> 05:38:07.138 align:start position:0%
this this chart looks interesting the
 
05:38:09.948 --> 05:38:09.958 align:start position:0%
one on the left in particular
 
05:38:14.510 --> 05:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:17.868 --> 05:38:17.878 align:start position:0%
so this is going into our new Juvenile
 
05:38:20.030 --> 05:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
Justice assessment work which is brand
 
05:38:22.850 --> 05:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
new as of last year right so I probably
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
will have a hard time explaining that
 
05:38:26.030 --> 05:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
one without going through the first page
 
05:38:27.890 --> 05:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
a little bit just to orient folks to
 
05:38:29.270 --> 05:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
what's happening in that system if folks
 
05:38:32.208 --> 05:38:32.218 align:start position:0%
want to turn back to 16 really quick
 
05:38:34.250 --> 05:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
so again the brand new system that we're
 
05:38:35.810 --> 05:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
setting up using a child adolescent
 
05:38:37.250 --> 05:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
needs and strengths tool whenever a kid
 
05:38:38.868 --> 05:38:38.878 align:start position:0%
has contact with law enforcement to try
 
05:38:40.730 --> 05:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
to divert them deflect them away from
 
05:38:42.410 --> 05:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
the formal court system and towards
 
05:38:45.050 --> 05:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
Services what you see on the very first
 
05:38:47.090 --> 05:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
slide is just how many each district
 
05:38:49.070 --> 05:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
office had and you'll see some of those
 
05:38:50.708 --> 05:38:50.718 align:start position:0%
numbers are really small that's because
 
05:38:53.270 --> 05:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
it was rolled out in kind of a you know
 
05:38:54.830 --> 05:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
one third of the state at a time right
 
05:38:56.810 --> 05:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
so that's just the total number the next
 
05:38:59.208 --> 05:38:59.218 align:start position:0%
page is of all the times law enforcement
 
05:39:01.310 --> 05:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
referred a family to us because this is
 
05:39:03.050 --> 05:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
voluntary families could say nope I'm
 
05:39:04.970 --> 05:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
not interested in which case law
 
05:39:06.230 --> 05:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement can move forward with their
 
05:39:07.310 --> 05:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
traditional process and their
 
05:39:09.708 --> 05:39:09.718 align:start position:0%
traditional decision but when law
 
05:39:11.510 --> 05:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement made that referral test 72
 
05:39:13.250 --> 05:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
percent of the times the family said yes
 
05:39:15.050 --> 05:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
I want to go through this process I want
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
to have the cans done and see if we can
 
05:39:19.788 --> 05:39:19.798 align:start position:0%
you know come to a to an alternate way
 
05:39:22.128 --> 05:39:22.138 align:start position:0%
of of resolving this then that leads us
 
05:39:24.470 --> 05:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
to the next page
 
05:39:27.650 --> 05:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
so the next page is recommended
 
05:39:29.330 --> 05:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
interventions following the cans
 
05:39:31.970 --> 05:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
assessment so of those 72 percent of the
 
05:39:33.890 --> 05:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
families that said yes and that we've
 
05:39:35.570 --> 05:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
completed the process for so you'll see
 
05:39:38.270 --> 05:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
this the net here doesn't add up to the
 
05:39:39.890 --> 05:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
total conducted during that year because
 
05:39:41.868 --> 05:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
it's about a 60-day process to go
 
05:39:42.830 --> 05:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
through this
 
05:39:44.990 --> 05:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
but this is kind of what we're seeing is
 
05:39:46.610 --> 05:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
of all those families that come to us
 
05:39:48.830 --> 05:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
only about 28 are being recommended to
 
05:39:51.050 --> 05:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
go to court involvement
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
about 14 are being recommended for kind
 
05:39:54.890 --> 05:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
of lower level Behavioral Health
 
05:39:56.390 --> 05:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
intervention that's that green box there
 
05:39:57.590 --> 05:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
where it says community-based mental
 
05:39:58.850 --> 05:39:58.860 align:start position:0%
health really what we're talking about
 
05:40:00.890 --> 05:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
there is individualized counseling
 
05:40:02.868 --> 05:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
that's probably one of the greatest pain
 
05:40:04.550 --> 05:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
points right now of getting kids
 
05:40:06.890 --> 05:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
Services because typically what that is
 
05:40:08.390 --> 05:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's a referral to Community Mental
 
05:40:09.288 --> 05:40:09.298 align:start position:0%
Health Center and they're really
 
05:40:12.050 --> 05:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
struggling to get kids into those slots
 
05:40:14.090 --> 05:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
to get individual counseling services so
 
05:40:16.070 --> 05:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
if there's a place in here that I think
 
05:40:18.230 --> 05:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
really needs some some propping up it's
 
05:40:19.910 --> 05:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
that piece of the system to get kids
 
05:40:21.650 --> 05:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
that individual level counseling that
 
05:40:23.510 --> 05:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
they need and that we're identifying
 
05:40:24.890 --> 05:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
that they need but they end up on wait
 
05:40:26.510 --> 05:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
lists for a long time
 
05:40:28.610 --> 05:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
so I hear you the problem statement
 
05:40:31.010 --> 05:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
what's your solution recommendation I
 
05:40:32.270 --> 05:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
think that's something that you know
 
05:40:34.250 --> 05:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
really talking through this with our
 
05:40:35.448 --> 05:40:35.458 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Partners is probably
 
05:40:36.590 --> 05:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
better than anything that I'm going to
 
05:40:37.970 --> 05:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
come up with since I oversee the
 
05:40:40.850 --> 05:40:40.860 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Services but
 
05:40:43.190 --> 05:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
that is definitely that is definitely
 
05:40:45.590 --> 05:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
probably our biggest area of need is
 
05:40:47.390 --> 05:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
access to individual outpatient services
 
05:40:49.970 --> 05:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
for kids and it's really not even just
 
05:40:51.230 --> 05:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
the Community Mental Health Centers
 
05:40:53.150 --> 05:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
that's the primary place but you see
 
05:40:55.250 --> 05:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
this phenomena happening of private
 
05:40:56.750 --> 05:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
providers refusing to take any insurance
 
05:40:58.670 --> 05:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
at this point right going solely to
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
private pay which for many of our
 
05:41:02.810 --> 05:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
families is not an option
 
05:41:04.850 --> 05:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's it's a big issue in the
 
05:41:07.670 --> 05:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
mental health space right now so so I'm
 
05:41:10.190 --> 05:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
just trying to also understand if if
 
05:41:11.868 --> 05:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
there's some good news buried in this
 
05:41:15.230 --> 05:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
pie chart that the 28 percent of the
 
05:41:18.770 --> 05:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
court involved this is based off of the
 
05:41:21.770 --> 05:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
711 or the 72 percent that the family
 
05:41:24.708 --> 05:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
agreed to get involved with that means
 
05:41:27.890 --> 05:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
they had a real relatively positive
 
05:41:31.128 --> 05:41:31.138 align:start position:0%
outcome for their kid except for 28
 
05:41:33.650 --> 05:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
percent of the time correct yeah I think
 
05:41:35.510 --> 05:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is really really promising data
 
05:41:37.128 --> 05:41:37.138 align:start position:0%
about the way that this new program is
 
05:41:38.570 --> 05:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
working in terms of being able to
 
05:41:40.490 --> 05:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
identify alternatives to court
 
05:41:42.708 --> 05:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
involvement for young people and what I
 
05:41:44.208 --> 05:41:44.218 align:start position:0%
think is really exciting about this when
 
05:41:46.368 --> 05:41:46.378 align:start position:0%
I think about the next few years is that
 
05:41:47.810 --> 05:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
these are young people who this is
 
05:41:49.670 --> 05:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes their very first interaction
 
05:41:51.288 --> 05:41:51.298 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement what would
 
05:41:52.850 --> 05:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
typically happen is young person might
 
05:41:54.050 --> 05:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
have an interacted with law enforcement
 
05:41:56.330 --> 05:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
law enforcement might
 
05:41:58.190 --> 05:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
just say look they'll talk to the
 
05:41:59.510 --> 05:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
parents they're not going to prosecute
 
05:42:01.070 --> 05:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
them but these kids will come back
 
05:42:02.390 --> 05:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
they'll come back they'll come back and
 
05:42:03.770 --> 05:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
nobody will have ever done an assessment
 
05:42:05.090 --> 05:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
of what's really going on there and what
 
05:42:07.128 --> 05:42:07.138 align:start position:0%
these kids need now we're actually doing
 
05:42:08.570 --> 05:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
that assessment getting those families
 
05:42:09.948 --> 05:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
engaged with Services when these kids
 
05:42:12.230 --> 05:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
are young so I think this is kind of
 
05:42:13.788 --> 05:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
where when I talk about you know five
 
05:42:15.170 --> 05:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
years from now our system being
 
05:42:16.550 --> 05:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
different this is one of the key things
 
05:42:17.868 --> 05:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
that I think is going to get us there is
 
05:42:20.030 --> 05:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
those families who historically might
 
05:42:21.530 --> 05:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
have had repeated contacts with law
 
05:42:23.090 --> 05:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
enforcement before anybody even bothered
 
05:42:24.590 --> 05:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
to look at look at what those kids
 
05:42:26.868 --> 05:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
needed are now having that work done now
 
05:42:28.850 --> 05:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
and this assessment process it doesn't
 
05:42:30.770 --> 05:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
only do the assessment and identify the
 
05:42:32.510 --> 05:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
resource but they'll stay open for a
 
05:42:33.650 --> 05:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
period of time to make sure the family
 
05:42:35.570 --> 05:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
is connected to the resource which is
 
05:42:37.250 --> 05:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
where I get this data from around or
 
05:42:39.410 --> 05:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
this anecdotal data around the biggest
 
05:42:41.628 --> 05:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
pain point being for outpatient services
 
05:42:43.430 --> 05:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
for kids because our staff are telling
 
05:42:44.868 --> 05:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
me that's the thing they can't get their
 
05:42:47.690 --> 05:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
kids into of all these services so with
 
05:42:50.390 --> 05:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
all this priority on finding other
 
05:42:50.400 --> 05:42:52.550 align:start position:0%
all this priority on finding other
avenues

05:42:52.550 --> 05:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
avenues
 
05:42:55.490 --> 05:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
um what what kind of scenario
 
05:42:58.670 --> 05:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
um is is leaving that 28 percent there
 
05:43:00.650 --> 05:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
what what what kind of
 
05:43:02.990 --> 05:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
immovable Force are we dealing with so
 
05:43:04.490 --> 05:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
what the assessment's really looking at
 
05:43:05.868 --> 05:43:05.878 align:start position:0%
is a couple things right it's looking at
 
05:43:07.730 --> 05:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
the needs of the young person
 
05:43:09.410 --> 05:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
the strengths that we can build upon
 
05:43:11.448 --> 05:43:11.458 align:start position:0%
with a young person and also the needs
 
05:43:13.368 --> 05:43:13.378 align:start position:0%
and strengths of the family unit
 
05:43:16.368 --> 05:43:16.378 align:start position:0%
so what would what typically you're
 
05:43:17.750 --> 05:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
looking at here is you know young person
 
05:43:18.948 --> 05:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
had contact with law enforcement
 
05:43:20.810 --> 05:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there's some type of violent
 
05:43:21.890 --> 05:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
element of that right they're going to
 
05:43:23.090 --> 05:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
fight after school or something like
 
05:43:24.410 --> 05:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
that that brought law enforcement to
 
05:43:26.390 --> 05:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
their door when they're coming to us
 
05:43:28.310 --> 05:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
we're doing our assessment we're not
 
05:43:29.930 --> 05:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
seeing a long list of violence we're
 
05:43:31.368 --> 05:43:31.378 align:start position:0%
seeing kids with high levels of
 
05:43:33.050 --> 05:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
depression and anxiety and other types
 
05:43:34.610 --> 05:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
of you know challenges like that and
 
05:43:36.590 --> 05:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
we're making referrals out to that that
 
05:43:38.690 --> 05:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
28 typically what you're seeing there
 
05:43:40.788 --> 05:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
are either you know more serious
 
05:43:40.798 --> 05:43:41.948 align:start position:0%
are either you know more serious
offenses

05:43:41.948 --> 05:43:41.958 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
05:43:46.070 --> 05:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
or kids and families who are
 
05:43:49.070 --> 05:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
so an armed robbery right something like
 
05:43:50.810 --> 05:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
that that's going to definitely go get
 
05:43:54.048 --> 05:43:54.058 align:start position:0%
into this or you know sexually based
 
05:43:55.910 --> 05:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
offenses where you know somebody is you
 
05:43:57.288 --> 05:43:57.298 align:start position:0%
know a sexual assault of another
 
05:43:59.030 --> 05:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
individual things like that are going to
 
05:44:01.010 --> 05:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
fall into this category it's not just
 
05:44:02.868 --> 05:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
defense based though it also looks at
 
05:44:04.490 --> 05:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
the Readiness and willingness of the
 
05:44:05.690 --> 05:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
family and the youth to engage
 
05:44:08.628 --> 05:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
voluntarily in services so if you have a
 
05:44:10.850 --> 05:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
situation where yes they agreed to go
 
05:44:13.010 --> 05:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
through this process but what the
 
05:44:14.330 --> 05:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
results are telling us is that this
 
05:44:15.830 --> 05:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
young person this family are not going
 
05:44:17.510 --> 05:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
to actually show up to individual
 
05:44:18.708 --> 05:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
counseling they're not going to actually
 
05:44:20.390 --> 05:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
show up to the fast forward program that
 
05:44:22.190 --> 05:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
we're recommending then that's a
 
05:44:23.330 --> 05:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
situation where you know Court
 
05:44:25.010 --> 05:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
involvement is helpful because the judge
 
05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
can then kind of
 
05:44:28.850 --> 05:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
get those services in place so that's
 
05:44:30.410 --> 05:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
what that 28 is looking at
 
05:44:33.770 --> 05:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative question uh yes just
 
05:44:35.570 --> 05:44:35.580 align:start position:0%
understand here you got a body of people
 
05:44:35.580 --> 05:44:36.410 align:start position:0%
understand here you got a body of people
here

05:44:36.410 --> 05:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:44:38.270 --> 05:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
you got a body of people here are those
 
05:44:42.110 --> 05:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
the same people or or is they are
 
05:44:47.570 --> 05:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
so this is a subset of the big box here
 
05:44:47.580 --> 05:44:48.770 align:start position:0%
so this is a subset of the big box here
right

05:44:48.770 --> 05:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:44:50.810 --> 05:44:50.820 align:start position:0%
this is a subset but this has more
 
05:44:51.890 --> 05:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
people in it
 
05:44:53.810 --> 05:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
this has over a thousand people in it
 
05:44:56.510 --> 05:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
and this has uh what is it got um no I
 
05:44:59.090 --> 05:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
think what you're seeing here is these
 
05:45:00.770 --> 05:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
are not all unique so a young person can
 
05:45:02.330 --> 05:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
go through a service or go through this
 
05:45:04.850 --> 05:45:04.860 align:start position:0%
process and have multiple referrals
 
05:45:07.070 --> 05:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
okay so you could have one young person
 
05:45:08.750 --> 05:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
who were saying they need to be involved
 
05:45:10.850 --> 05:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
in individual mental health counseling
 
05:45:12.350 --> 05:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
and they also should be part of a
 
05:45:13.910 --> 05:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
restorative practice through a diversion
 
05:45:15.650 --> 05:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
program okay so that's why the numbers
 
05:45:18.770 --> 05:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
this is 72 this is the set this is a
 
05:45:20.868 --> 05:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
part of the 72 because these are the
 
05:45:23.628 --> 05:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
completed assessments and the 72 is
 
05:45:25.310 --> 05:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
everything that walked in the door and
 
05:45:26.628 --> 05:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
what happened to the others the ones
 
05:45:28.490 --> 05:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
that didn't get uncompleted they're they
 
05:45:29.750 --> 05:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
were still in process at the end of the
 
05:45:31.250 --> 05:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
calendar year so this is calendar year
 
05:45:33.288 --> 05:45:33.298 align:start position:0%
one data so people who walked in the
 
05:45:35.510 --> 05:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
door and say December weren't done yet
 
05:45:37.190 --> 05:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
in January when this data was pulled
 
05:45:41.030 --> 05:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:42.948 --> 05:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
um but the other big things here right a
 
05:45:44.628 --> 05:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
lot of kids are being identified for
 
05:45:46.250 --> 05:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
higher end Mental Health Services that's
 
05:45:48.048 --> 05:45:48.058 align:start position:0%
that orange bucket here for things like
 
05:45:49.730 --> 05:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
fast forward that's the kind of formal
 
05:45:52.010 --> 05:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
big system of care that we talk about
 
05:45:53.990 --> 05:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of kids actually just showing up
 
05:45:55.368 --> 05:45:55.378 align:start position:0%
saying that they need to have some kind
 
05:45:57.230 --> 05:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
of involvement in some community-based
 
05:45:58.850 --> 05:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
activity right which could be a Boys and
 
05:46:00.830 --> 05:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
Girls Club it could just be get the kid
 
05:46:02.030 --> 05:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
involved in Little League so they have
 
05:46:03.530 --> 05:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
some kind of pro-social activity that
 
05:46:05.330 --> 05:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
gets them out of doing nonsense right
 
05:46:06.470 --> 05:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
and gets them into something that's
 
05:46:08.030 --> 05:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
healthy for them
 
05:46:09.890 --> 05:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
um you see a big category here for other
 
05:46:11.750 --> 05:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of creative thinking from
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
our staff about ways that ways that
 
05:46:15.708 --> 05:46:15.718 align:start position:0%
young people can kind of heal the the
 
05:46:17.448 --> 05:46:17.458 align:start position:0%
damage that they caused you know a lot
 
05:46:18.650 --> 05:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
of times kids have contact with law
 
05:46:19.610 --> 05:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
enforcement because they did something
 
05:46:19.620 --> 05:46:20.868 align:start position:0%
enforcement because they did something
foolish

05:46:20.868 --> 05:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
foolish
 
05:46:22.430 --> 05:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
they might not have a big Behavioral
 
05:46:24.048 --> 05:46:24.058 align:start position:0%
Health need they were being impulsive
 
05:46:25.310 --> 05:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
they were following the lead of their
 
05:46:27.230 --> 05:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
peers you know going through the
 
05:46:29.390 --> 05:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system or even a big
 
05:46:31.368 --> 05:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
formal intervention isn't necessary but
 
05:46:32.990 --> 05:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
you know working with that young person
 
05:46:35.208 --> 05:46:35.218 align:start position:0%
to figure out how do you how do you kind
 
05:46:37.310 --> 05:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
of cure whatever damage you caused with
 
05:46:38.690 --> 05:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
the people that you harmed through your
 
05:46:38.700 --> 05:46:40.128 align:start position:0%
the people that you harmed through your
behaviors

05:46:40.128 --> 05:46:40.138 align:start position:0%
behaviors
 
05:46:41.690 --> 05:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
um and then the smaller sliver here for
 
05:46:43.548 --> 05:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
voluntary JJ Services you see that's
 
05:46:45.288 --> 05:46:45.298 align:start position:0%
only two percent early on I talked about
 
05:46:47.270 --> 05:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
something called voluntary chins
 
05:46:49.368 --> 05:46:49.378 align:start position:0%
so if we want to get a person into a
 
05:46:51.708 --> 05:46:51.718 align:start position:0%
very intensive evidence-based model like
 
05:46:53.208 --> 05:46:53.218 align:start position:0%
multi-systemic therapy that I spoke
 
05:46:54.948 --> 05:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
about at the beginning of it this is the
 
05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
pathway to do that because right now
 
05:46:58.310 --> 05:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
that model is only available through a
 
05:47:00.650 --> 05:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
formal Juvenile Justice case at some
 
05:47:01.788 --> 05:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
point in the future I would love to be
 
05:47:03.890 --> 05:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
able to move that program into being
 
05:47:05.208 --> 05:47:05.218 align:start position:0%
accessible through the system of care
 
05:47:06.890 --> 05:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
but we're just not there yet in terms of
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
implementing this new model for folks
 
05:47:11.270 --> 05:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and then the diversion programs
 
05:47:12.530 --> 05:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
that's what I talked about before those
 
05:47:13.910 --> 05:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
are kind of restorative justice type
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
models for kids in the community that's
 
05:47:18.708 --> 05:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
the place where we do have a prioritized
 
05:47:20.208 --> 05:47:20.218 align:start position:0%
need to try to beef that up a little bit
 
05:47:22.430 --> 05:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
because we have real challenges with
 
05:47:24.048 --> 05:47:24.058 align:start position:0%
Equity across the state in providing
 
05:47:25.670 --> 05:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
those Services you have some parts of
 
05:47:27.350 --> 05:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
the state that locally fund these things
 
05:47:29.270 --> 05:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
and do a great job and you have other
 
05:47:30.410 --> 05:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
parts of the state where young people
 
05:47:31.910 --> 05:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
just don't have access to the service
 
05:47:34.070 --> 05:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
because it's it's not a local priority
 
05:47:36.650 --> 05:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
so it's getting close to four o'clock
 
05:47:36.660 --> 05:47:38.230 align:start position:0%
so it's getting close to four o'clock
so

05:47:38.230 --> 05:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:47:40.730 --> 05:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
if is there are there any questions in
 
05:47:41.750 --> 05:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
this area
 
05:47:46.368 --> 05:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm going to jump to 22.
 
05:47:49.430 --> 05:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
slide 22 and I am jumping a whole lot of
 
05:47:52.788 --> 05:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
information there but
 
05:47:55.368 --> 05:47:55.378 align:start position:0%
um in the Bureau of community family and
 
05:47:58.430 --> 05:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
program support one of the things that
 
05:48:00.650 --> 05:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
these community-based Services is meant
 
05:48:05.208 --> 05:48:05.218 align:start position:0%
to do is to help us get uh involved in
 
05:48:08.230 --> 05:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
interrupt human trafficking
 
05:48:11.208 --> 05:48:11.218 align:start position:0%
what's our New Hampshire experience is
 
05:48:13.930 --> 05:48:13.940 align:start position:0%
this is this a
 
05:48:18.350 --> 05:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
even a case is a big deal but is this uh
 
05:48:20.930 --> 05:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
how how would you re-rate New Hampshire
 
05:48:23.150 --> 05:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
relative to other states
 
05:48:25.548 --> 05:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
so we definitely see cases through the
 
05:48:27.288 --> 05:48:27.298 align:start position:0%
child protection system of kids who are
 
05:48:29.650 --> 05:48:29.660 align:start position:0%
engaged in traffic and kids who
 
05:48:32.208 --> 05:48:32.218 align:start position:0%
oftentimes what you see is folks who are
 
05:48:33.530 --> 05:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
looking for kids who are vulnerable
 
05:48:34.788 --> 05:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
because they're part of the juvenile
 
05:48:36.350 --> 05:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
justice system or the child protection
 
05:48:38.208 --> 05:48:38.218 align:start position:0%
system they don't have strong adult
 
05:48:40.190 --> 05:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
supports around them and they try to get
 
05:48:42.410 --> 05:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
those kids engaged in commercial sex
 
05:48:44.690 --> 05:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
activities and things like that we see
 
05:48:46.610 --> 05:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
you know I wouldn't say a massive number
 
05:48:49.010 --> 05:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
but probably at least a dozen instances
 
05:48:50.750 --> 05:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
like that each year for young folks in
 
05:48:51.708 --> 05:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:48:53.810 --> 05:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
where that's a where that's a serious
 
05:48:56.390 --> 05:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern so those are tend to
 
05:48:58.970 --> 05:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
be organic kids that have grown up here
 
05:49:01.730 --> 05:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
that have been brought in or enticed as
 
05:49:03.410 --> 05:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
opposed to somebody who's been brought
 
05:49:06.590 --> 05:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
across the board or the state lines to
 
05:49:09.948 --> 05:49:09.958 align:start position:0%
correct okay yeah and we have a we have
 
05:49:12.110 --> 05:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
a staff person who focuses specifically
 
05:49:14.150 --> 05:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
on that work and engages in there's a
 
05:49:15.770 --> 05:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
task force a state task force around
 
05:49:17.628 --> 05:49:17.638 align:start position:0%
this issue that coordinates with law
 
05:49:18.770 --> 05:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement around investigation
 
05:49:20.628 --> 05:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
prosecution and all that stuff and I
 
05:49:22.190 --> 05:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
would assume there's a high correlation
 
05:49:26.270 --> 05:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
with the drug use yes all right yeah
 
05:49:28.910 --> 05:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay are are there
 
05:49:32.930 --> 05:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
other issues questions representable
 
05:49:36.530 --> 05:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you back to Pages 19 and 20. right
 
05:49:39.048 --> 05:49:39.058 align:start position:0%
great page 19 we've seen this graph
 
05:49:41.628 --> 05:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
before multiple times
 
05:49:43.548 --> 05:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
um page 20 looks like there's an
 
05:49:46.070 --> 05:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
averaging per month for that same data
 
05:49:46.080 --> 05:49:47.948 align:start position:0%
averaging per month for that same data
set

05:49:47.948 --> 05:49:47.958 align:start position:0%
set
 
05:49:50.330 --> 05:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
if if I'm reading the graph correctly
 
05:49:52.490 --> 05:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to know is since roughly
 
05:49:55.128 --> 05:49:55.138 align:start position:0%
July 2020 and if your team can put this
 
05:49:55.138 --> 05:49:56.510 align:start position:0%
July 2020 and if your team can put this
together

05:49:56.510 --> 05:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:49:59.150 --> 05:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
right how many times we've crossed over
 
05:50:01.730 --> 05:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
the 15 threshold
 
05:50:04.850 --> 05:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
versus 18 right I'm looking at page 20
 
05:50:06.890 --> 05:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
where it shows we're basically under 15
 
05:50:09.470 --> 05:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
the entire time and then more
 
05:50:12.110 --> 05:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
specifically right is this let's say a
 
05:50:12.120 --> 05:50:13.490 align:start position:0%
specifically right is this let's say a
weekend

05:50:13.490 --> 05:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
weekend
 
05:50:17.030 --> 05:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
where there's no there's no you can't
 
05:50:18.410 --> 05:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
get to a court there's other options
 
05:50:20.030 --> 05:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
that prohibit you from being able to
 
05:50:21.830 --> 05:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
address the issue at hand so there's
 
05:50:23.628 --> 05:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
some backlog because the event happened
 
05:50:25.310 --> 05:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
over a weekend and it's Monday before
 
05:50:26.810 --> 05:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
you get to be in front of a judge to
 
05:50:28.368 --> 05:50:28.378 align:start position:0%
deal with the issues I'm trying to see
 
05:50:31.610 --> 05:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
if right where these events sorry where
 
05:50:33.590 --> 05:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
the numbers cross over the 15 threshold
 
05:50:36.590 --> 05:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
and why if you could I could I could go
 
05:50:38.208 --> 05:50:38.218 align:start position:0%
back and have our staff you know have
 
05:50:39.948 --> 05:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
our data folks kind of pull the
 
05:50:41.330 --> 05:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
instances of where we cross the 15
 
05:50:43.430 --> 05:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
threshold and get you that I will say
 
05:50:46.788 --> 05:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
you know anecdotally we do see more kids
 
05:50:49.368 --> 05:50:49.378 align:start position:0%
get detained on Fridays and Saturdays I
 
05:50:51.230 --> 05:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
don't know whether that's because people
 
05:50:52.610 --> 05:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
don't have access to judges because we
 
05:50:54.590 --> 05:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
actually do have emergency contact with
 
05:50:57.890 --> 05:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
judges 24 7 365. I think it's because a
 
05:50:59.628 --> 05:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
lot of activities occur on Fridays there
 
05:51:02.030 --> 05:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
is definitely a component of kids
 
05:51:03.650 --> 05:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
playing on the weekends Friday and
 
05:51:05.990 --> 05:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
Saturday I get that but there's also no
 
05:51:08.270 --> 05:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
way to disposition that easily within a
 
05:51:10.070 --> 05:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
courtroom you can get an ex parte order
 
05:51:11.868 --> 05:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
there's lots of things you can do
 
05:51:14.628 --> 05:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
right 24 7. what you can't have is a
 
05:51:16.128 --> 05:51:16.138 align:start position:0%
fair and impartial hearing Saturday
 
05:51:18.350 --> 05:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
morning so there will be a backlog
 
05:51:20.208 --> 05:51:20.218 align:start position:0%
between Friday night and Monday morning
 
05:51:21.650 --> 05:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
to start dealing with some of that I
 
05:51:23.030 --> 05:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
just wasn't sure whether this was
 
05:51:25.010 --> 05:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
weekend Peaks or something else going on
 
05:51:26.930 --> 05:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I can go back and try to get that
 
05:51:28.970 --> 05:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
data for you but you know like I said we
 
05:51:32.330 --> 05:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
do definitely see you know weekend is
 
05:51:34.430 --> 05:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
the is the highest likelihood of a
 
05:51:36.048 --> 05:51:36.058 align:start position:0%
detention a new detention coming to us
 
05:51:43.208 --> 05:51:43.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:46.250 --> 05:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
we I want to wrap up in the next five to
 
05:51:49.788 --> 05:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
six minutes if not sooner is are there
 
05:51:51.770 --> 05:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
other questions that jump out from
 
05:51:54.230 --> 05:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
anyone on these slides there's some
 
05:51:56.330 --> 05:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
several of them with the whole entire
 
05:51:58.430 --> 05:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
departments on it that may be of
 
05:51:58.440 --> 05:52:04.330 align:start position:0%
departments on it that may be of
interest

05:52:04.330 --> 05:52:04.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:06.590 --> 05:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
if if you don't mind indulging me for
 
05:52:08.150 --> 05:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
one second I just a couple key points
 
05:52:09.530 --> 05:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make from the data slides
 
05:52:11.090 --> 05:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
for child protection I can do it in two
 
05:52:11.100 --> 05:52:12.590 align:start position:0%
for child protection I can do it in two
minutes

05:52:12.590 --> 05:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
05:52:14.150 --> 05:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:52:15.890 --> 05:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
um if you look at slides number eight
 
05:52:16.970 --> 05:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
and nine
 
05:52:18.590 --> 05:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's really telling the story of
 
05:52:19.910 --> 05:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
what's happening at Child Protection
 
05:52:19.920 --> 05:52:21.048 align:start position:0%
what's happening at Child Protection
intake

05:52:21.048 --> 05:52:21.058 align:start position:0%
intake
 
05:52:22.548 --> 05:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
so that's the hotline
 
05:52:26.330 --> 05:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
and we do see 2022 actually being a
 
05:52:28.670 --> 05:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
record high year in terms of calls to
 
05:52:31.250 --> 05:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
the hotline and the chart below that
 
05:52:33.948 --> 05:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
that's that's calls per month to the
 
05:52:38.090 --> 05:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
hotline blue is 2022 pink is the the dot
 
05:52:40.610 --> 05:52:40.620 align:start position:0%
on the January at the top that's last
 
05:52:43.490 --> 05:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
month so we do see right almost every
 
05:52:45.890 --> 05:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
month in 2022 and now the first month of
 
05:52:48.650 --> 05:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
2023 are really kind of peak numbers in
 
05:52:49.970 --> 05:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
terms of calls coming to the hotline
 
05:52:51.288 --> 05:52:51.298 align:start position:0%
which is something that does have me
 
05:52:53.510 --> 05:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
05:52:55.010 --> 05:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
um you know Workforce and what we're
 
05:52:56.510 --> 05:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
seeing in terms of just new things
 
05:52:59.090 --> 05:52:59.100 align:start position:0%
coming into the system the next page
 
05:53:00.948 --> 05:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
looks at the assessments which would lag
 
05:53:02.570 --> 05:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
a little bit behind the hotline in terms
 
05:53:05.930 --> 05:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
of this peak so you do see the total
 
05:53:07.310 --> 05:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
number of Assessments in state fiscal
 
05:53:11.030 --> 05:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
year 2022 on page 10 being you know
 
05:53:13.548 --> 05:53:13.558 align:start position:0%
higher than 20 and 21 but a little less
 
05:53:16.010 --> 05:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
than 2019 what has me a little bit
 
05:53:17.690 --> 05:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
worried is when you look at page 11 and
 
05:53:19.190 --> 05:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
you look at the month by month that goes
 
05:53:20.868 --> 05:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
beyond the state fiscal year but goes to
 
05:53:23.090 --> 05:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
the last seven months every single month
 
05:53:24.830 --> 05:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
of the last seven months we've had a
 
05:53:26.448 --> 05:53:26.458 align:start position:0%
higher assessment volume than typical
 
05:53:29.330 --> 05:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
right so it does have me worried that on
 
05:53:30.890 --> 05:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
the assessment side we're seeing higher
 
05:53:33.288 --> 05:53:33.298 align:start position:0%
than typical volume as well as on the
 
05:53:34.850 --> 05:53:34.860 align:start position:0%
calls into intake
 
05:53:37.250 --> 05:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
and then on the next page this is family
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
service cases this is where we actually
 
05:53:41.930 --> 05:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
open a case because of what we
 
05:53:43.610 --> 05:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
discovered during the assessment process
 
05:53:45.590 --> 05:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
was that either abuse neglect was
 
05:53:48.948 --> 05:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
occurring or that if it wasn't abuse or
 
05:53:50.510 --> 05:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
neglect it was severe enough that we
 
05:53:52.190 --> 05:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to open up and offer a voluntary
 
05:53:53.810 --> 05:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
case for a family that's a small number
 
05:53:56.030 --> 05:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
of the total but that is part of it and
 
05:53:57.830 --> 05:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
you do see here fortunately while the
 
05:54:00.590 --> 05:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
total in 2022 you know it's higher than
 
05:54:02.750 --> 05:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
it was in 2021 but still below where it
 
05:54:04.970 --> 05:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
was in 2019 when you look at the monthly
 
05:54:07.910 --> 05:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
growth on the next chart page 13 we're
 
05:54:10.250 --> 05:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
seeing a similar story where the state
 
05:54:12.288 --> 05:54:12.298 align:start position:0%
fiscal year data is kind of at the start
 
05:54:15.230 --> 05:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
of an upward Trend and that the last six
 
05:54:16.970 --> 05:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
to seven months every single month it's
 
05:54:19.010 --> 05:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
going up so if you look at the chart 13
 
05:54:21.708 --> 05:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
and you look at the Blue Line you do see
 
05:54:23.410 --> 05:54:23.420 align:start position:0%
kind of growth almost every single month
 
05:54:26.208 --> 05:54:26.218 align:start position:0%
to the pink line the pink dot at the top
 
05:54:28.310 --> 05:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
of January of us kind of getting back to
 
05:54:29.810 --> 05:54:29.820 align:start position:0%
where we were a couple years ago when we
 
05:54:32.390 --> 05:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
were near our Peak numbers so again if
 
05:54:34.190 --> 05:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
you think of the system right the call
 
05:54:36.170 --> 05:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
is the first thing you see spiking
 
05:54:37.970 --> 05:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
assessment numbers are the next thing
 
05:54:40.670 --> 05:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
actual cases are the next thing so I do
 
05:54:42.770 --> 05:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
have concerns looking at the recent data
 
05:54:44.390 --> 05:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
about growth
 
05:54:47.930 --> 05:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
um in demand countries and structures
 
05:54:51.170 --> 05:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
is there a new structure or a growing
 
05:54:53.270 --> 05:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
stressor what we're hearing a lot of
 
05:54:54.770 --> 05:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
from our staff right and this is
 
05:54:56.628 --> 05:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
anecdotal I don't have
 
05:54:59.390 --> 05:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
qualitative quantitative data on this is
 
05:55:01.010 --> 05:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
kind of the Acuity of what's walking in
 
05:55:02.930 --> 05:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
the front door feels heavier than as in
 
05:55:05.390 --> 05:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
years past right so while the raw number
 
05:55:07.190 --> 05:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
of substance use cases is lower than it
 
05:55:08.690 --> 05:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
was a few years ago the substance use
 
05:55:10.010 --> 05:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
cases we're getting are much more
 
05:55:10.020 --> 05:55:10.970 align:start position:0%
cases we're getting are much more
serious

05:55:10.970 --> 05:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
serious
 
05:55:13.430 --> 05:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
as a whole right lots of folks involved
 
05:55:14.990 --> 05:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
with fentanyl use and other types of
 
05:55:17.510 --> 05:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
really really serious substances which
 
05:55:19.190 --> 05:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
would yield more kids having to come
 
05:55:20.990 --> 05:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
into foster care in those situations
 
05:55:23.270 --> 05:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
than if you say had one parent who was
 
05:55:24.708 --> 05:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
struggling with substance use and you
 
05:55:26.208 --> 05:55:26.218 align:start position:0%
had another protective parent who's able
 
05:55:28.010 --> 05:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
to support those kids while the parent
 
05:55:29.330 --> 05:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
while the ones are struggling going
 
05:55:31.270 --> 05:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
through Services
 
05:55:34.610 --> 05:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
seeing increased demands and again also
 
05:55:36.230 --> 05:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
around the mental health system in terms
 
05:55:38.030 --> 05:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
of unmet mental health needs of parents
 
05:55:40.788 --> 05:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
contributing to the ability of of them
 
05:55:42.170 --> 05:55:42.180 align:start position:0%
to kind of keep their kids safe and
 
05:55:44.570 --> 05:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
parent their children and also hearing
 
05:55:45.770 --> 05:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
and seeing
 
05:55:45.780 --> 05:55:46.368 align:start position:0%
and seeing
um

05:55:46.368 --> 05:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:48.890 --> 05:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
real challenges around kind of shifts in
 
05:55:50.330 --> 05:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
the economy for some of these folks and
 
05:55:52.190 --> 05:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
not being able to just you know meet
 
05:55:54.830 --> 05:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
basic needs of their kids sometimes
 
05:55:59.390 --> 05:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
so fentanyl is is the big drug in the in
 
05:56:00.890 --> 05:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
the news
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
um what's secondary what's what's the
 
05:56:04.970 --> 05:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
second biggest drug that we have to
 
05:56:07.128 --> 05:56:07.138 align:start position:0%
worry about well the ones that I worry
 
05:56:08.990 --> 05:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
most about right so there's right
 
05:56:11.330 --> 05:56:11.340 align:start position:0%
there's drugs all types of drugs but the
 
05:56:13.070 --> 05:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
type that tends to have a kid have to
 
05:56:15.350 --> 05:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
come into the care are your more serious
 
05:56:17.510 --> 05:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
drugs right so when you see folks using
 
05:56:20.150 --> 05:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
methamphetamines and when you see folks
 
05:56:21.590 --> 05:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
using fentanyl those are really
 
05:56:23.390 --> 05:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
concerning drugs
 
05:56:24.770 --> 05:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
um the scariest thing I've ever seen in
 
05:56:26.570 --> 05:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
my life was a parent who was using PCP
 
05:56:27.670 --> 05:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
that was back in New Jersey
 
05:56:29.390 --> 05:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't have a big
 
05:56:30.948 --> 05:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
problem with that up here now but those
 
05:56:33.170 --> 05:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between you know
 
05:56:34.730 --> 05:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
some drug use and others and there's
 
05:56:36.230 --> 05:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
some substance use that you can work
 
05:56:38.628 --> 05:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
with a family around and and try to make
 
05:56:40.010 --> 05:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
sure you have a protective person in the
 
05:56:41.208 --> 05:56:41.218 align:start position:0%
home maybe it's a grandmother or
 
05:56:43.128 --> 05:56:43.138 align:start position:0%
somebody else and there's other things
 
05:56:44.690 --> 05:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing more of today that are
 
05:56:47.628 --> 05:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
just just scarier and harder to be able
 
05:56:49.610 --> 05:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
to feel confident leaving that child you
 
05:56:54.110 --> 05:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:54.120 --> 05:57:00.128 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:57:00.128 --> 05:57:00.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:05.090 --> 05:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:09.288 --> 05:57:09.298 align:start position:0%
you know okay uh Mr so so thank you you
 
05:57:12.890 --> 05:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
all can go about your day enjoy your
 
05:57:16.070 --> 05:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
last 30 minutes or whatever uh Mr Ripple
 
05:57:18.590 --> 05:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
you got any words of wisdom for us we're
 
05:57:20.990 --> 05:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
getting together again
 
05:57:21.000 --> 05:57:22.548 align:start position:0%
getting together again
tomorrow

05:57:22.548 --> 05:57:22.558 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
05:57:24.890 --> 05:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at 10 to hear public health and
 
05:57:26.448 --> 05:57:26.458 align:start position:0%
uh nope I don't have anything else to
 
05:57:26.458 --> 05:57:28.610 align:start position:0%
uh nope I don't have anything else to
add

05:57:28.610 --> 05:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
add
 
05:57:31.250 --> 05:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is Public Health
 
05:57:34.750 --> 05:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
It also says dcyf continued are we done
 
05:57:37.368 --> 05:57:37.378 align:start position:0%
so I think you are looking yes you're
 
05:57:39.170 --> 05:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
done and I think you're looking at the
 
05:57:40.788 --> 05:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
original calendar schedule which
 
05:57:42.650 --> 05:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I had to send out or I
 
05:57:44.208 --> 05:57:44.218 align:start position:0%
asked Janet to send out a revision so
 
05:57:46.368 --> 05:57:46.378 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is public health only and
 
05:57:48.070 --> 05:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
Wednesday will be Behavioral Health only
 
05:57:51.230 --> 05:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
okay we start at 11 tomorrow then or do
 
05:57:54.170 --> 05:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
we start at 10. still 10 o'clock okay so
 
05:57:56.750 --> 05:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
we start at 10 with public health what's
 
05:57:59.208 --> 05:57:59.218 align:start position:0%
your sense now that you've seen
 
05:58:01.910 --> 05:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
how we're rolling is that a three-hour
 
05:58:04.610 --> 05:58:04.620 align:start position:0%
deal a four-hour deal well in the past
 
05:58:06.110 --> 05:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
because there are so many accounting
 
05:58:07.850 --> 05:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
units it has taken a long time to get
 
05:58:09.288 --> 05:58:09.298 align:start position:0%
through but it really depends on how
 
05:58:11.448 --> 05:58:11.458 align:start position:0%
many questions the committee asks there
 
05:58:12.650 --> 05:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
are there's not a whole lot of General
 
05:58:14.270 --> 05:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
funds in public health it is mostly
 
05:58:16.128 --> 05:58:16.138 align:start position:0%
federal funds so it depends on how much
 
05:58:18.708 --> 05:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
you want to dive in so this is the one
 
05:58:20.750 --> 05:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
where on average the matching
 
05:58:22.910 --> 05:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
requirement of General funds the Public
 
05:58:26.570 --> 05:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
Health Federal money is about 20 percent
 
05:58:29.030 --> 05:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
of the 80 percent for federal is that a
 
05:58:31.788 --> 05:58:31.798 align:start position:0%
is that a rough percentage uh it's that
 
05:58:33.470 --> 05:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
sounds right it is overwhelmingly
 
05:58:36.048 --> 05:58:36.058 align:start position:0%
federal funds overwhelmingly yeah
 
05:58:38.750 --> 05:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh question
 
05:58:41.990 --> 05:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you just based on the open-ended
 
05:58:44.208 --> 05:58:44.218 align:start position:0%
nature of the day tomorrow and the
 
05:58:45.530 --> 05:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
impending weather
 
05:58:47.628 --> 05:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
do you we're going to be continuing
 
05:58:49.730 --> 05:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
after the lunch hour into the afternoon
 
05:58:53.090 --> 05:58:53.100 align:start position:0%
just for people who may need to plan
 
05:58:56.750 --> 05:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
okay so in general I try to ignore the
 
05:58:58.970 --> 05:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
weather because the speaker's paying
 
05:59:00.770 --> 05:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
attention to it and then they issue
 
05:59:04.730 --> 05:59:04.740 align:start position:0%
guidance guidance so I tend to I tend to
 
05:59:07.190 --> 05:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
just assume that we'll follow whatever
 
05:59:10.670 --> 05:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
Guidance the speaker gives and I expect
 
05:59:13.670 --> 05:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
tomorrow to be pretty typical in terms
 
05:59:17.208 --> 05:59:17.218 align:start position:0%
of us taking time off for lunch if if if
 
05:59:20.030 --> 05:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
if it looks like that's a poor thing to
 
05:59:21.948 --> 05:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
do and the smart thing is to drive
 
05:59:23.868 --> 05:59:23.878 align:start position:0%
through because we're making better
 
05:59:25.670 --> 05:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
progress in public health and we could
 
05:59:28.930 --> 05:59:28.940 align:start position:0%
just get out sooner I'm open to that
 
05:59:31.548 --> 05:59:31.558 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that I would think of it
 
05:59:34.190 --> 05:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
on my own immediately so feel free to
 
05:59:37.190 --> 05:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
speak up if it seems like that's a
 
05:59:37.200 --> 05:59:39.530 align:start position:0%
speak up if it seems like that's a
possibility

05:59:39.530 --> 05:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
05:59:41.090 --> 05:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about some people who drive
 
05:59:42.708 --> 05:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
a little further
 
05:59:45.110 --> 05:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so what's it supposed to do
 
05:59:46.490 --> 05:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
tomorrow it's supposed to be weather
 
05:59:52.090 --> 05:59:52.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:54.948 --> 05:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
so so the snow that we have to deal with
 
05:59:58.010 --> 05:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with coming in will
 
06:00:00.110 --> 06:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
there be an accumulation probably while
 
06:00:10.250 --> 06:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:12.770 --> 06:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
okay but while we're in here are we
 
06:00:16.190 --> 06:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
expecting more accumulation
 
06:00:16.200 --> 06:00:20.930 align:start position:0%
expecting more accumulation
okay

06:00:20.930 --> 06:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:20.940 --> 06:00:23.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:00:23.270 --> 06:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:23.280 --> 06:00:24.788 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:00:24.788 --> 06:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:00:27.830 --> 06:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh so just stay tuned I mean who knows
 
06:00:29.810 --> 06:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
the speaker May cancel because of the
 
06:00:31.548 --> 06:00:31.558 align:start position:0%
people driving from the North Country I
 
06:00:34.970 --> 06:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
don't I don't I don't presume to know
