00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:26.519 align:start position:0%

Ado um
 
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:32.920 align:start position:0%

of council and juvenile court
 
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
proceedings and the focus of this bill
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
is to improve the uh delivery of that
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
particular service in the juvenile
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%

00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
of assigned councel when
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
necessary the um the reason this bill
 
00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.990 align:start position:0%
necessary the um the reason this bill
was

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
drafted was was that the judicial
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
Council some time ago commissioned a
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
report uh that was to
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
analyze the uh the
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
the affording of council to juveniles in
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
the juvenile justice system and how
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
effective that has been that job was
 
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
done by the national juvenile Defender
 
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.910 align:start position:0%
done by the national juvenile Defender
Center

Center
 
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
and I have sent and hopefully you have
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
all received a copy of that report in
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
some respects if you read the report you
 
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
probably don't have to listen to me but
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
um given how busy we are shall we say uh
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
you get me to give the uh the head note
 
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
version okay as a result of receiving
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
this report which had maybe 50 or so Rec
 
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations for improving the
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
delivery of legal services to juveniles
 
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
in the Juvenile Justice System uh at the
 
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion of the Judiciary chair then
 
00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
Marjorie Smith I formed a working group
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh to see what we could do to take these
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
um proposals and see what would stand a
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
chance of passing and being enacted in
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it was a uh a
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
distinguished group of Republicans and
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
Democrats uh lawyers and non- lawyers it
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
included then Judiciary chair margerie
 
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
Smith and now Jud and and the current
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
Judiciary chair um representative Gordon
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
who's also a retired
 
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
judge um representative Waltz was on
 
00:12:59.470 --> 00:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
that who's been a prior chair of
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
Children and Family Law um
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
representative long was was kept
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
apprised from time to time about this
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
and uh representative L contributed to
 
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
that group also the group met numerous
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
times both with the judici uh I was
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
interfacing with judicial councel we met
 
00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
with practitioners we met with court
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
people we met with providers we met with
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
a representative of the juvenile
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
Defender system and we put this bill
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
together I want to briefly say
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
that there are a whole host of areas
 
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
that we decided not to touch just
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
because it was too big and ask we are
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
not dealing with the issue of detention
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
hearings diversion we're not talking
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
about use of Lost students at in the
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
diversion process we're not talking
 
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.710 align:start position:0%
diversion process we're not talking
about

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
police uh use of police as
 
00:14:09.389 --> 00:14:09.399 align:start position:0%
prosecutors we're not talking about
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
school resource officers which is a big
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
issue uh we decided not to get into the
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
issue of certification of of children to
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
adult court and we didn't get into the
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
establishment of performance and other
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
standards um so if you think this bill
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
accomplishes a lot there's a whole lot
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
more that we decided not to focus on so
 
00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839 align:start position:0%
the major areas that this bill deals
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
with the first and perhaps the most
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
important is to require appointment of
 
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
council when the petition is
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
filed and that's when the court gets the
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
paperwork it's expected at that point
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
the court will assign Council to the
 
00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.949 align:start position:0%
the court will assign Council to the
juvenile

00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
juvenile
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
and that means prior to the first
 
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
Hearing in court there is required to
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity for the Juvenile and
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
Council to
 
00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:14.839 align:start position:0%
consult the notice to assign council is
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
to be provided the same day as a
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
petition is filed and that can be done
 
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.509 align:start position:0%
petition is filed and that can be done
electronically

00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
telephone um carrier pigeon St Bernard
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be uh the idea is to get
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
that done as Fair as possible so that
 
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
some communication between attorney and
 
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:36.279 align:start position:0%
the juvenile can occur before getting to
 
00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:37.990 align:start position:0%
the juvenile can occur before getting to
court

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
and while a juvenile and a parent or
 
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
Guardian can wave
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
Council we do have a mandatory provision
 
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
that that can't be done until and unless
 
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
the Juvenile and the parent or Guardian
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
has an opport has had an opportunity to
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
discuss the wisdom of waiver with
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
Council now our current statute has some
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
of these Provisions in it they're not
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
necessarily widely used for instance
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
there is a provision where a juvenile
 
00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
with his or her parents can consult with
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
an attorney about getting counsel at no
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
fee the fee the cost of that would be
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
buil to the judicial Council our
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
information is that is rarely if ever
 
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
used and that seems to be a problem in a
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
lot of areas in our current juvenile law
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
there may be Provisions they're not
 
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
often used so by getting Council
 
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.590 align:start position:0%
often used so by getting Council
appointed

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
early right off the bat then a lot of
 
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
other things fall into place there's one
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
tweak that may get mentioned later and
 
00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
that is and that may require a small
 
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:56.839 align:start position:0%
Amendment or not depending how the
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
judicial branch looks at it and that is
 
00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
if the court doesn't have sufficient
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
information at the filing of the
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
petition time to decide whether the
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
juvenile is indent or not uh the
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
appointment should be considered
 
00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:17.919 align:start position:0%
provisional and subject to the uh Court
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
reviewing that at a later date and it's
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
the same thing as if somebody is
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
appointed counsel and the person you
 
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
know uh wins the lottery the court can
 
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.390 align:start position:0%
know uh wins the lottery the court can
always

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
always
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
go back and say well you no longer need
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
the services of a paid for lawyer so if
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
that needs to be clarified and it's not
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
sure that it does that's that's a small
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
tweet that can be
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
made the second big area of the uh bill
 
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
is to require Council to be available
 
00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.070 align:start position:0%
is to require Council to be available
for

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
consultation if there's to be police
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
interrogation of a
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
child uh uh the preliminary material to
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
the bill before the actual working part
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
the Preamble makes mention of the
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's point of view it's US
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's point of view is that
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
children do not feel that they can just
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
terminate an interview with the police
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
or walk out when the police are uh
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
talking to them children are different
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
than adults so that becomes basic
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
basically a custodial situation it isn't
 
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
a whole lot different than Miranda it's
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
basically Miranda and what this bill
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
says is
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
that if it doesn't bar the police from
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
talking to the child it simply says that
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
anything said by the child if that child
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
has not had an opportunity to consult
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
with a lawyer cannot be used against
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
that child in a further uh and a
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
prosecution of the
 
00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
child uh the implementation of that is
 
00:19:05.159 --> 00:19:06.149 align:start position:0%
child uh the implementation of that is
being

00:19:06.149 --> 00:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
left um to be worked out
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
administratively how that Council would
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
be uh practically done may be different
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and Nashua where an
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
attorney might be nearby and can
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
physically go over it might be quite
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
different in uh in the more rural parts
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
of the state in the northern part of the
 
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
state and that consultation with an
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
attorney can be done
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
telephonically uh if privacy is ensured
 
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
and other protections are there so the
 
00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
principle of it is set out in the
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
statute and I think the judicial branch
 
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
and the judicial Council and uh
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
interested stakeholders can work out how
 
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
that would be done
 
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:57.559 align:start position:0%
administratively the um the third major
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
area is that the fee for
 
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
councel for appointed counsel in
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
juvenile cases would be
 
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
ended now a characteristic of our
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
Juvenile justice system is that the
 
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
parents pay at virtually every stage of
 
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.070 align:start position:0%
parents pay at virtually every stage of
the

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
process and what it means is a lot of
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
those stages aren't
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
accomplished because the parents cannot
 
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
will not choose not to pay for instance
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
there is on the books a right to appeal
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
if if you have a bad decision in your
 
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
opinion in juvenile court um you have a
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
right to appeal that but a parent would
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
have to pay
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
$2,000 so out of the thousands and
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of cases that
 
00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:53.990 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of cases that
occur

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
occur
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
annually I think there have been four
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
appeals in five years so you can have an
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
appeal right on the books but it doesn't
 
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.909 align:start position:0%
appeal right on the books but it doesn't
really

00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
exist we didn't want to go through
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
despite the
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the report and
 
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
eliminate all of the parental payments
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh throughout the entire line of of of
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
the juvenile case we thought that was
 
00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:24.039 align:start position:0%
too big and ask um so what we're doing
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
here is saying the right to
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
counil for that
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
kid is not going to be dependent on
 
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
whether the parents can or want to pay
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
for their kids lawyer the kid is
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
entitled to that it's a kid that's going
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
to go through all the processing and the
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
kid is going to go through everything
 
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
else and um that's an important um right
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
of of that child and I want to emphasize
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
at this point that what we're talking
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
about here are constitutionally required
 
00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.269 align:start position:0%
about here are constitutionally required
rights

00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about what would be
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
nice to have and what's not nice to have
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
and what be what would be cool and not
 
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
cool uh the right to council for
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
juveniles and Juvenile Justice is
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
constitutionally required under the
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
United States
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution and that means to put it
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
frankly the best way to see that that's
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
effectuated is through the legislature
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
as opposed to going through the courts
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
we are the people's uh Representatives
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's also cheaper more effective and
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
more nuanced I think if if we as
 
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
legislators do that um the second thing
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
I wanted to point as long as I'm taking
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
a little side trip is we hear a lot of
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
anecdotal evidence in New Hampshire and
 
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
this is true in a lot of States we get
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
bills that come up and people come come
 
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
in and tell anecdotes and I listen to a
 
00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
lot of the bail Reform Commission uh
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
hearings and you would get people coming
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
in and saying well my experience is this
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
my experience is that and she from what
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
I see everybody's back out on the
 
00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:09.799 align:start position:0%
streets 10 days later and somebody else
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
comes in and everybody is locked up and
 
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
nobody's out on the
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
streets the data here and the the
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
information here is backed up by data
 
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.549 align:start position:0%
information here is backed up by data
not

00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
anecdotes and later on today a
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative or this morning a
 
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
representative of the national juvenile
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
Defender Center who put the report
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
together will in fact talk about
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
specifics of our Juvenile Justice
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
program so you know that we're talking
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
about something that's fact-based rather
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
than anecdotal
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
based one last area and um
 
00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh will be which will also be
 
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
discussed is we will be eliminating that
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
by this bill flat fee cont contracts for
 
00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
representation of juveniles by private
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
Council what we have as a system now
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
which is not all that common in uh in
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
how these are set up with other agencies
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
is a lawyer has paid a flat fee to
 
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
handle a certain class of cases and it's
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
not dependent on how complicated the
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
case is or the amount of work required
 
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
for that case and unfortunately what
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
that means is if a lawyer is getting
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
paid $300 to handle a
 
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
case the client's going to get $300
 
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
worth of work whether the case requires
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
$300 worth of work or $1,500 worth of
 
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
work I mean that's just the reality of
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
of real life so um the recommendation
 
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
from the national juvenile Defender
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
Center and consistent with what happens
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
in in in most contracts in the state uh
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
of this nature payment of assigned coun
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
will be based on an hourly rate and that
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
would be decided by the judicial branch
 
00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
so uh and that would presumably be in
 
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
Conformity with how it's done with other
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh similar
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances so those are the major
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
areas of what this bill does and it
 
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
basically will
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that council is there
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
sooner that Council has effective time
 
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
to talk to
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
clients that oh there's one other area
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
to mention the bill also makes it clear
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
that representation shall be on all
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
matters related to the subject matter of
 
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.190 align:start position:0%
matters related to the subject matter of
the

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
petition so that if there are
 
00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
um uh appeals if there are collateral
 
00:25:59.389 --> 00:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
placement issues that that attorney
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
who's already familiar with the case
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
continues to work on the case but we put
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
a limitation in saying it has to be
 
00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
within the subject matter of the
 
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
petition for instance the juvenile may
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
also have let's say an IEP
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
issue nothing to do with the petition or
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
why the child is in juvenile justice
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
system this does not mean that an
 
00:26:27.549 --> 00:26:27.559 align:start position:0%
attorney is mandated to be appointed for
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
that child for the purposes of IEP
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
proceedings representation shall be full
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
and wholesome for everything that has to
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
do with the subject matter of the
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
petition and of the petition only and
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
the last thing I want to do before I
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
turn it over to some others and answer
 
00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:53.559 align:start position:0%
any questions is to note that the major
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the national
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
juvenile Defender Center was to to
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
completely switch over the system to one
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
of specialized attorneys handling
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
juvenile matters
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
exclusively and in many respects that is
 
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
the best
 
00:27:14.909 --> 00:27:14.919 align:start position:0%
practice uh because if you have highly
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
trained Specialists many of these
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
changes will flow from that however that
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
seemed to be in an age of budget crisis
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
and other issues um an unrealistic ask
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
to reform the system in that matter so
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
what we've decided to do uh in our
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
working group was to say okay we're not
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
going to uh toss out the whole old
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
system and put in a new best practices
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
system we are going to try to make at
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
least the necessary changes to keep the
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
car on the road and that's what we're
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
trying to do here I do want to say and
 
00:27:59.509 --> 00:27:59.519 align:start position:0%
give credit to the judicial Council
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
that although we are not in this bill
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
talking about establishing State
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
qualifications and performance standards
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
that there is a serious effort by the
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
judicial Council to continue with
 
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
improve and make ongoing uh the training
 
00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
of lawyers who handle juvenile cases
 
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
that is ongoing it has been ongoing and
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
it will be ongoing and and I think
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
mention needs to be made of that so
 
00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:34.039 align:start position:0%
that's my overview I know I spoke for a
 
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
while and um if there are questions I'm
 
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
happy to answer if not there's some more
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
people who can give specific
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
answers thank you representative Burch
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.630 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
yella hi thank you uh for recognizing me
 
00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
and thank thank you for taking the
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.789 align:start position:0%
question um
is

00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
this you mentioned the constitutionality
 
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
of required uh right to counsel
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
and is it your understanding that that
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
requirement is
 
00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:19.519 align:start position:0%
for criminal
 
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
cases or um strictly or also for civil
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
cases and what does this fall under and
 
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh is there a
 
00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
requirement seeming requirement in this
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
bill to uh allow or require the
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity for for representation in
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
civil cases thank you thank you for your
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
question representative and it's a good
 
00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.669 align:start position:0%
question representative and it's a good
one

00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
um in in juvenile land uh it's referred
 
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
to as delinquency cases as uh juveniles
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
presumably cannot commit crimes they do
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
delinquent acts but but the same concept
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
this bill relates only to the
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
delinquency aspects and I think the
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
Constitutional mandate on those is
 
00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely clear um how I personally
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
believe that the Liberty interests are
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
such in children in need cases that an
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
argument can be made that there are um
 
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements but I'm not
 
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
making that argument today for civil
 
00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:35.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
today but I'd be glad to visit with you
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
further okay are there any further
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative lewicki thank
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um I don't see a fiscal
 
00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:54.519 align:start position:0%
note attached to this uh do we have a
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
good idea of uh any idea of how much
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost and how to
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
money all right um no there is no fiscal
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
note and
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
um uh the representative from the
 
00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
judicial Council will speak a bit as to
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
the costs of this bill in many of the
 
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
changes we'll have very little Financial
 
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
impact uh having a council appointed
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later has very very
 
00:31:28.279 --> 00:31:29.269 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later has very very
little

00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
impact um one area that may have an
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
impact is in the uh assigning of council
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
or the
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
um uh provision of council to a juvenile
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
who's being questioned if it's done by
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
telephone or similar means the cost
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
would be fairly minimal if it's done by
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
having a public defender head over to
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
the police station and uh that's going
 
00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:06.919 align:start position:0%
to entail greater cost the um the
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
overall costs I don't think are going to
 
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
be huge but someone else will be
 
00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
representative okay and just a reminder
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
though that we we vote on the policy not
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
the price pack that goes along with it
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
we vote whether or not we support the
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
policy going forward not the financial
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
aspect of it are there any more
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%

of Court involvement HB 188 is an
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
important First Step requiring the
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
appointment of council once a
 
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:35.320 align:start position:0%

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
prior to waving the right to counsel is
 
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
vital to doe process protections the
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
provision prohibiting admittance of a
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
statement from an unrepresented minor in
 
00:34:52.349 --> 00:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
any judicial proceeding is also critical
 
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
to ensuring young people's rights we
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
also support the other provisions of HB
 
00:34:58.349 --> 00:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
188 that were mentioned
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
um here but because this bill covers
 
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
such a range and there will be others
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
speaking I'll limit my remarks to the
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
appointment of council more than 50
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
years ago the United States Supreme
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
Court issued in ralt a landmark decision
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
declaring that children require The
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
Guiding hand of council at every step in
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
the proceedings this vital
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to councel must
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
begin prior to the child's first
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
appearance in court since G state
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
legislator and courts have grappled with
 
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
how to implement that right for a
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
population that is developmentally
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
different than adults and need
 
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
safeguards to protect their rights too
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
often in courts across our country and
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire a Defender will not
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
meet their client until the first
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
appearance at the courthouse if they are
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
lucky the defender and child might have
 
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
five to 10 minutes to discuss the case
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming hearing if they're not
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
so lucky the defender might get only a
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
few whispered comments to their new
 
00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
client while standing at Council table
 
00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:50.839 align:start position:0%
just before the hearing begins this
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
Falls far short of what the Constitution
 
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
requires of the right to councel if
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
council is not appointed until the first
 
00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
court parents the child and their family
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
must walk into the courthouse with
 
00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
little to no understanding of what is
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
happening leaving them overwhelmed and
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
Confused one of our key findings in our
 
00:36:08.589 --> 00:36:08.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire assessment was that the
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
appointment system does not provide
 
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
counsil to youth early enough as a
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
result they may appear at their initial
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
court hearing without counsel and enter
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
pleas without ever Consulting with an
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
attorney in our assessment we make the
 
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation to automatically
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
appointment appoint Council for all
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
youth before their first court
 
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
appearance and ensure their represented
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
throughout their involvement in the
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
legal system
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
hpb18 requirement that the appointment
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
of council shall be made sufficiently
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
before any hearing to allow for
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
consultation between councel and client
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
as well as for any appropriate
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
investigation is an important step
 
00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:41.079 align:start position:0%
toward ensuring that young people have
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to fully participate in
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
their own defense which is what the
 
00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.710 align:start position:0%
their own defense which is what the
Constitution

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
requires in recognition of the
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
developmental differences of young
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
people New Hampshire has already put
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
some safeguards in place severely
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
limiting how and when a young person may
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
wave their right to counsel however njdc
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
OB erve through our assessment that in
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
some jurisdictions many children were
 
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
still waving their right to counsel and
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
pleading at arraignment without ever
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
Consulting with with counsel about their
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
right to an attorney HB 188 would add
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
the additional safeguards necessary to
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
ensure that all children in New
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire regardless of jurisdiction
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
receive the benefit of this
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
protection involvement in the
 
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
delinquency system can create a
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
multitude of barriers to a Young
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
Person's future opportunities for
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
employment housing and education
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
juvenile defense attorneys can play a
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
significant role in helping eliminate
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
such barriers
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
comprehensive representation by juvenal
 
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys encompasses a wide
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
range of in and outof Court advocacy
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
currently under New Hampshire law
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
representation for youth in delinquency
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
proceedings automatically ends 30 days
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
after disposition unless a post-d
 
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
dispositional motion is filed within
 
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
that time frame the provision of HB 1888
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
that requires representation include
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
related proceedings related to the same
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
factual circumstances allows for more
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
holistic advocacy by attorneys um which
 
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
allows for continued communication and
 
00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
Report building which is Critical with
 
00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
young clients finally we also support
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
the prision excuse me um The Proposition
 
00:38:08.309 --> 00:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
that uh not only that children have
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient opportunity to consult with
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
counsel before any statement or
 
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
confession is obtained by law
 
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement um that that may not be used
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
in court developmental research suggests
 
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
youth may be more susceptible than
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
adults to interrogation pressures
 
00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
because they are less likely to
 
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
understand legal process or their rights
 
00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
have less impulse control and are more
 
00:38:28.829 --> 00:38:28.839 align:start position:0%
prone to risky decision making are more
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
susceptible to immediate rewards and
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
have more difficulty in anticipating the
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
consequences of their actions they're
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
more likely to comply with authority and
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
are more susceptible to Pure influence
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
based on the existing research it's
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
clear that special caution is required
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
when interroga you requiring access to
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
and consultation with councel prior to
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
the use of any confession or statement
 
00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:50.839 align:start position:0%
obtained by law enforcement upholds
 
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
children's constitutional right to
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
counsel and ensures the Integrity of
 
00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:56.839 align:start position:0%
Investigations involving children as
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
long ago as 1948 the Supreme Court
 
00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
asserted we cannot believe that a lad of
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
Tender Years is a match for the police
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
in such a contest he needs counsel and
 
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
support if he is not to become the
 
00:39:10.109 --> 00:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
victim first of fear then of panic more
 
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
recently the Supreme Court held the age
 
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
informs the Miranda analysis for
 
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogations because
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
children subjected to police questioning
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
often feel more pressured to comply with
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
authority than adults the Supreme Court
 
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
aply stated by its very nature custodial
 
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
police interrogation entails inherently
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
compelling pressure
 
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
even for an adult the physical and
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
psychological isolation of custodial
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
interrogation can undermine the
 
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
individual's will to resist and compel
 
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
him to speak where he would not
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise do so freely this bill would
 
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
assist children in understanding their
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
rights in the legal process before they
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
are subject to the overpowering presence
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
of the law Studies have found that in
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
the absence of council almost 90% of the
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
children wave their Miranda rights with
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
few children understanding the rights
 
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
they're waving this leaves children
 
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
literally defenseless in the face of
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
trained professionals seeking to secure
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
confessions HB 188 will afford children
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
earlier access to counsel throughout New
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and provide the child and
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
attorney proper time for consultation
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
before any court hearing njdc strongly
 
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
supports HB 188 and respectfully urges
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
the L legislator's support thank you and
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
I'm ha we'll be submitting written
 
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
testimony with additional details um and
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
support and I'm happy to answer any
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
questions now as
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
well great thank you so much are there
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
yella you're there hi thank you and uh
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question um in
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
the assessment that you uh created did
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
you find
 
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
any conclusions that are um contrary to
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
the stated mission of the group that you
 
00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:03.069 align:start position:0%
the stated mission of the group that you
um

00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
represent I'm not sure I entirely and uh
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
understand your question so you you made
 
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
um a bunch of statements about what what
 
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
the goal of your um group is yes and the
 
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
state Mission and then you made an
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
assessment on New Hampshire and I'm
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
wondering if you found anything
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
um unusual or um contrary to your State
 
00:41:33.069 --> 00:41:33.079 align:start position:0%
admission in the assessment of New
 
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sure and I can say you know
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
our assessment we can't go to Every
 
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
court and every jurisdiction so there
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
are certainly limitations um
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
however we found a lot of strength there
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
are a lot of strengths in New Hampshire
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
to the juvenile defense system what we
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
primarily found were a lot of systemic
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
barriers to um I think in New
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire most people working in the
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system and the juvenile
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
defense system uh had the goal of
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
excellence in juvenile defense and
 
00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
promoting Justice for children and
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
ensuring the constitutional right to
 
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
counsel I should say in our interviews
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
across stakeholder groups judges
 
00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
Defenders probation officers um the
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
majority of people we talked to saw no
 
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
reason that Council couldn't be at um
 
00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:20.839 align:start position:0%
appointed earlier and thought that
 
00:42:24.549 --> 00:42:24.559 align:start position:0%
children needed it um so I think a lot
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
of what we found were more systemic
 
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
barriers uh getting in the way of um you
 
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
mission thank
 
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
you any further questions from members
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%

Center and on behalf of the juvenile
 
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
reform project which as many of you are
 
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with it's a coalition of groups
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
that have been involved in uh reform of
 
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
the juvenile justice system over several
 
00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
years it includes New Hampshire legal
 
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
assistance my office the ACLU of New
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Waypoint and new
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
futures um my experience uh earlier in
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
my career um involved a fair amount of
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
involvement in the Juvenile Justice
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
System I spent the first 17 years of my
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
career at the public defender program as
 
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
a lawyer as a supervisor and ultimately
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
as director of the program um I've also
 
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
been a consultant on Indigent defense
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
issues in California and
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania I'd like to begin my
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
testimony just by talking about um how
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
pervasive disability is in the juvenile
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
justice justice system and that's really
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
why my office has been involved in these
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
reform efforts for so long um most
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
research um focuses on the population of
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
children that end up in facilities where
 
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
most information is more information is
 
00:44:28.109 --> 00:44:28.119 align:start position:0%
available than just children who show up
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
in court and that research is really
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
striking it shows that about 70% of kids
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
or more in juvenile facilities have
 
00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:38.559 align:start position:0%
disabilities typically behavioral
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
disorders but a wide range of
 
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities um it may even be higher in
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I was present at a
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
legislative hearing two years ago where
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
representatives of the Department of
 
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services said that
 
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
fully 100% of the children at the suu
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
center in Manchester um had a disability
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
of one sort or another
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
now the high representation of kids with
 
00:45:01.549 --> 00:45:01.559 align:start position:0%
disabilities in the Juvenile Justice
 
00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:05.079 align:start position:0%
System um is due to a variety of reasons
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
and Dynamics one is as you might imagine
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
um when someone has a disability they
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
often experience School failure and
 
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
alienation from peers that might be you
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
know positive influences if they weren't
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
alienated from them um alienation from
 
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
coaches teachers other non-parent adults
 
00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:26.559 align:start position:0%
they may have difficulty with impulse
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
control they may have difficulty
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
understanding and conforming to rules
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
and structures that they're subjected to
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
um may be difficulty difficult for them
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
to uh consider the consequences of their
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
behaviors um and also they may have more
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
difficulty than their peers at
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
misbehaving successfully if you will
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
they tend to be pretty
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful um uh uh actors when it
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
comes to violating the law and it's very
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to get away with it
 
00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
as compared to kids without disabilities
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I think is very
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
important to think about is that there's
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
pretty good evidence that there that
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
kids with disabilities are processed in
 
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
the system differently they tend to have
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
more difficulty um dealing with
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
encounters with authority figures
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
including teachers dealing with
 
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
discipline issues police prosecutors and
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
judges after they may become involved in
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
the system and that's part of the reason
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
that you see kids getting kids with
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
disabilities getting deeper and deeper
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
into the system um as compared to their
 
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
non-disabled peers so this this High
 
00:46:32.829 --> 00:46:32.839 align:start position:0%
rate of disability is extremely
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
important to consider when you're
 
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about the importance of having
 
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
trained and skilled lawyers involved in
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
the system to assist these children um
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
as early as possible and throughout
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
their involvement in the system turning
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
to the to a couple of specific portions
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill um first I wanted to address
 
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
um the the section that eliminates the
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
use of flat fee contracts which is
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
section seven on page three line 10 now
 
00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
the the Indigent defense system for both
 
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
adults and children in New Hampshire
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
basically has three principle components
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of cases are handled
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
by the public defender program which is
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
a large nonprofit Law Firm that has a
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
contractual relationship with the state
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
it has lawyers on staff um they don't
 
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
charge the state on a perase basis they
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
basically have a large contract that
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
provides for a certain number of lawyers
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the state to handle a variety
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
of cases the second tier of the system
 
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
handles the most of the remainder of the
 
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
cases and that's a a contractual system
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
where private lawyers enter into
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
contracts with the state through the
 
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
judicial Council to provide cases in
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
various categories and they do that for
 
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
a flat fee that is for a misdemeanor you
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
get a certain number of hundreds of
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
dollars for a felony a couple of
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars I don't really know
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
what the number is anymore um and for
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
juveniles it's a flat fee as
 
00:47:56.589 --> 00:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
well um there's a very small number of
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
cases that are also handled on an hourly
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
rate but the system really has very few
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
of those left most of the cases are
 
00:48:04.109 --> 00:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
handled by these previous two components
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
I mentioned now the problem as you can
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
imagine is that a flat fee means that
 
00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
every action that you take reduces your
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
hourly rate that you're actually being
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
paid because regardless of whether you
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
spent 20 hours on a case or three hours
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
on a case you're getting the same amount
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
of money so the incentives are all in
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
the wrong direction now the hourly rates
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
that that the system pays for lawyers
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
hand handling cases on an hourly basis
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
either in the criminal system or other
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
parts of our system are way below what
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
lawyers typically make and long ago they
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
were surpassed by the average overhead
 
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839 align:start position:0%
rate of a New Hampshire Law Firm but at
 
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
least when you get those low hourly
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
rates you get paid more for more work
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen with the flat fee
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
system now in addition to this setting
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
the flat fee is just
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
inherently um a a blunt instrument
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
because the of the case are highly
 
00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.270 align:start position:0%
because the of the case are highly
variable

00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
variable
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
andby M giby you're fading a little bit
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
can you just speak up a little bit for
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
us all right sorry about that um it's
 
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:11.720 align:start position:0%
highly dependent on what kinds of legal
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
issues are in the case the facts of the
 
00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:15.640 align:start position:0%
case whether the minor has a disability
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
and how complex that disability is um
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
that may involve evaluations Consulting
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
with experts doing research outside the
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
the uh the law the actions of the
 
00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
prosecution and of the judge can can
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
trigger ex extra effort on the part of
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
the defense so it's extremely difficult
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh to predict at the outset what these
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of cases are gonna are gonna um
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
are gonna take in terms of efforts so
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
any system that uses a flat rate is
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
likely to undercompensated lawyers in a
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
vast not a majority of cases but a
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
significant fraction of those cases um
 
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
so that's those are my comments about
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
the flat rate system I urge you to um
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
adopt that portion of the bill
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
um so that uh lawyers are paid more for
 
00:50:02.789 --> 00:50:02.799 align:start position:0%
more work um next I want to talk about
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
the early appointment section which is
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
section two which it's sections two
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
through four both of all of which are on
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
page two now when a delinquency case is
 
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
begun in New Hampshire there's really no
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer until the first time that the
 
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
family and the child show up in court
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
the only exceptions for that is if a
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer is hired by the family that's a
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
very small fraction of the cases or if
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
the police are asking the judge to lock
 
00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
the kid up at the sununu center at the
 
00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
very beginning of the case the law in
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
those cases requires that that a lawyer
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
be called over to represent the kid at
 
00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:39.079 align:start position:0%
that particular hearing but typically a
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
child will go to court without a lawyer
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
and that and with little or no
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of what is about to happen
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they're accompanied by
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
parents who are pretty unhappy with the
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
child's Behavior they might have taken a
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
day off of work they may not be focused
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
on protecting the child's rights but on
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
making the child face the consequences
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
of their actions
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
um in addition they're walking into a
 
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
system that is a competitive adversary
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
process just like the adult Criminal
 
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:05.720 align:start position:0%
Justice System um For Better or Worse
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
some people think for worse but For
 
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
Better or Worse that's the system we
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
have and the people on the other side of
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
the case are looking to Prevail in the
 
00:51:15.069 --> 00:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
case um the consequences of these cases
 
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
can be profound even lifelong um and
 
00:51:21.309 --> 00:51:21.319 align:start position:0%
parents walk into these into these um
 
00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
cour houses without lawyers for
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
themselves or their children uh often
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
times wanting to be cooperative but
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
really not understanding the
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
consequences that uh May flow to their
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
children um the process can be
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
confusing prosecutors have an in
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
incentive to get the cases over with but
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
not have to come back later and bring in
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
Witnesses uh it may be difficult for
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
families to understand what information
 
00:51:46.789 --> 00:51:46.799 align:start position:0%
is important to give to the judge and
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
significant decisions are made on that
 
00:51:51.309 --> 00:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
first day the decision to either place
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
the child outside the home or allow them
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
to um continue living at home while the
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
case is pen
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
what sorts of conditions of release um
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's a very quite significant profound
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
day in the case uh so this proposal
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
would immediately assign Council when
 
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
the petition is filed this will make the
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
system much more fair and protect the
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
rights of
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
children having a lawyer though at that
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
first at that first day in court can
 
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
really make the system more fair um and
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
more efficient because it can reduce the
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
use of unnecessary restrictive
 
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
placements when they're not appropriate
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
and that can save the state money
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
um related to this is what uh
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative Burch mentioned is this
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
issue of indigency um you'll see that in
 
00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
in the provisions on that page there's a
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
limitation in the current law to
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
basically only assigning Council to
 
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
Indigent children which basically means
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
a child that can't hire Counsel on their
 
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
own um and the way that this is
 
00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
typically handled in the current system
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
is that paperwork is filled out about
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
the family's um Financial um status and
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
the judge makes an assessment as to
 
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
whether the family can afford to hire
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
counsel in juvenile cases um it's the
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
child itself that is supposed to be able
 
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
to um hire counsel so as you can imagine
 
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
very close to 100% of court involved
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
children are Indigent but the system
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
works now that you don't really get your
 
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
lawyer until you fill out the paperwork
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
so that's not a big deal now but if
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to sign councel when the
 
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
when the petition is filed it's
 
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
important that this paperwork not be an
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
impediment to that so I'd ask you that
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
you can consider modifying that language
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
and if the court is inclined if the
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
committee is inclined to do that I have
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
a some proposed language to change that
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
those sections that I can provide to the
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
chair so I've just focused on a few
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill my colleague Michelle
 
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
wangren of New Hampshire legal
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
assistance is also signed up to testify
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
about a couple of other parts I would
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
urge you to pass this bill it's a bill
 
00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
that will protect the rights of children
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
improve the outcomes for children and
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
and along the way I think it improves
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and well-being and I think
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
it'll make the system work more
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
efficiently and cost effectively I'd be
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%

chair and committee members for taking
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
my testimony today
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
I'm Sarah blet I'm the executive
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
director of the judicial Council and the
 
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
council is the state agency that is
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
responsible for ensuring the quality and
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
the coste effectiveness of indigent
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
defense the council members met on
 
00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
Tuesday to review this bill although we
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
did not have a full Quorum um the
 
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
members with the exception of the
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court member who abstained
 
00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:30.039 align:start position:0%
voted in favor of supporting this bill
 
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
if it includes a fiscal note um because
 
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
we anticipate a significant increase in
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
Indigent defense expenditures if this
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
bill is passed and wanted to be very
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
upfront about the costs that we see but
 
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
as you've heard from previous uh
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
testimony the judicial Council has
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
received this assessment from the
 
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
national juvenile Defender center it's
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
very clear to our members
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
that the representation of juveniles has
 
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
evolved significantly over the past
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
several years and the national trend is
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
to provide a more holistic model of
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
representation um the assessment was
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
very eye openening for our members and
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
we've been working closely with the
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
national juvenile Defender Center and
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders to address some of
 
00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:27.559 align:start position:0%
the issues that were
 
00:56:27.559 --> 00:56:30.029 align:start position:0%
the issues that were
raised

00:56:30.029 --> 00:56:30.039 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:56:33.789 --> 00:56:33.799 align:start position:0%
um we were actually in the process of
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
applying for a Federal grant that will
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
give us some financial assistance for
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
training programs and to initiate a
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
pilot program with a social worker who
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
specializes in juvenile
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
representation and the national juvenile
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
Defender Center has been working with us
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
application this Bill does an excellent
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
job of addressing some of the most
 
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
important findings of the assessment um
 
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
and as as you've heard and as you see
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
the sponsors were very thoughtful in
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
their approach to these various issues
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
um the judicial Council feels very
 
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
strongly that a fiscal note is needed
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
because although the policy is supported
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
we want the legislature to be aware of
 
00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
the price tag for this
 
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
you've heard quite a bit of testimony
 
00:57:32.029 --> 00:57:32.039 align:start position:0%
about the concerns with the flat fee
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursement model for our contract
 
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
attorney program and right now a
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
contract attorney is paid the same
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
amount for a juvenile case whether it's
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
a simple misdemeanor Criminal Trespass
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
or one of the most serious charges in
 
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
our criminal code and aggravated
 
00:57:55.029 --> 00:57:55.039 align:start position:0%
felonius sexual assault the flat fee
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
reimbursement model was actually
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
implemented when the previous governor
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
sonunu was in office and it was done as
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
a way to contain costs for the layer of
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
cases that cannot be handled by the
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
public defender
 
00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
program and in the last fiscal year we
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
paid approximately
 
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
$45,000 for contract attorneys to
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
represent juveniles to switch to an
 
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
hourly rate reimbursement based on those
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
numbers would result in a increase of
 
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
approximately 200 to $300,000 more
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
dollars for that system and I think
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
everybody who's spoken before me has
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
been very eloquent about the drawbacks
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
of a flat fee system we use that system
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
in our adult criminal matters as well um
 
00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
certainly it is now a dis favored uh
 
00:59:00.029 --> 00:59:00.039 align:start position:0%
reimbursement model you've heard the
 
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
issues with it and although it does come
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
with a significant cost the council
 
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:08.839 align:start position:0%
feels strongly that this bill with an
 
00:59:08.839 --> 00:59:10.069 align:start position:0%
feels strongly that this bill with an
appropriate

00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation um would really go a long
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
way to addressing one of the biggest
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
concerns that the national juvenile
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
Defender Center
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
raised costs for earlier appointment of
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
council are not expected to be
 
00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
significant at all as you've heard from
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
representative bur there would be costs
 
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
associated with Council
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
representing juveniles who are being
 
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
interrogated or questioned by the police
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
and there would also be a cost um for
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
representation in related matters so
 
00:59:49.029 --> 00:59:49.039 align:start position:0%
although the policy is very important
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
and very important to the judicial
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
councel they did direct me to make it
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
very clear that they believe this needs
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note so that all of you can see
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
what the cost would
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
be um I I want to thank the sponsors of
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
the bill because this really I know a
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
lot of time and thought went into this
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
their approach really was laser beam
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
focused on the biggest issues that we
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
are are facing our Juvenile justice
 
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
system today I won't take a lot more
 
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
time I know you have several other
 
01:00:29.029 --> 01:00:29.039 align:start position:0%
people to hear from but the the public
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
policy piece of this thing is really
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
crucial in terms of moving forward with
 
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
our representation and enhancing it in
 
01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:41.039 align:start position:0%
the ways that we are being advised to do
 
01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
and so the council is ready to make
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
these changes but want you to be aware
 
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
of that fiscal impact and I'm happy to
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
take any questions that you may
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
have thank you Miss blet are there any
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
questions from committee
 
01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you very much
 
01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your
 
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
time next up is representative Mary Beth
 
01:01:11.309 --> 01:01:11.319 align:start position:0%
walls to speak in
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
favor of the um
 
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
Bill I'm here can you hear me yes thank
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you um I too am cognizant of
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
the time and I will try to be brief here
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to talk about some of
 
01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
the major points and highlight this
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
first of all with respect to What Sarah
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
blet Said I now sit on finance I happen
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
to sit on division one where I oversee
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
the judicial council's budget we would
 
01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:40.039 align:start position:0%
welcome a fiscal note that would help us
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
determine what the appropriate amount is
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
so I think that would be terrific um uh
 
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
more generally I wanted to talk about
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
the fact of of where representative
 
01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
Burch started with this this has been a
 
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional mandate since
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
1967 this is not something that is
 
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
optional and in fact New Hampshire is
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
probably facing the threat of yet more
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
litigation because we are not
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
appropriately providing Council for
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
juveniles and litigation is just going
 
01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
to cost us money sometimes spending
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
money saves US money and this is one of
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
those examples we're spending a little
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
bit more money here to provide
 
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate Council will actually save
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
us money in the long run um we also know
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
that early appointment is the best for
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
the children for the parents and for the
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
lawyers trying to represent them it
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
yields better and cheaper
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
results and it's very important that
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
there be no reimbursement option or
 
01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
requirement I mean for the kids what
 
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
happens is when you have a reimbursement
 
01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:46.039 align:start position:0%
option for the juveniles it means the
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
parents are effectively paying it and
 
01:02:51.269 --> 01:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
they often push a child to to enter a
 
01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
plea or not to take other options
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
available to them because they don't
 
01:02:58.269 --> 01:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
want to be stuck with the cost and in
 
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
fact even the C the cost of a juvenile
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
diversion program which is only
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
$100 sometimes that's too much for a
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
family and a parent will turn down that
 
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
option because they're not interested in
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
paying even a mere $100 for a diversion
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
program um we also want to confirm that
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
um the right to counil should not be
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
controlled by a family's wealth or by
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
geography so parents with Mone
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
can go out and get private counsel or
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
pay these fees where children from more
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
impoverished families don't have that
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
option and don't receive the same
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
quality counsel um in fact parents have
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
a conflict of interest because it's the
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
parents interest to pay the least amount
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
possible it's the child's interest to
 
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
get the best representation possible and
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
those often end up in
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
Conflict um we also know I sat a year
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
ago on a committee that looked at the
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
recovery from the office of uh Cost
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
Containment and learned that the office
 
01:04:03.309 --> 01:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
of cross containment just about breaks
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
even that with the amount of money that
 
01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
they seek from defendants both juveniles
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
and adults to pay for lawyers and the
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
amount of cost to run that office is
 
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
nearly identical um and all honesty
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
there is a slight uh net intake there
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
but it's so small as to really be
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
meaningless and in all honesty the
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
finance committee has looked at
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
eliminating the office of Cost
 
01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:27.079 align:start position:0%
Containment because the recovery Y is so
 
01:04:27.079 --> 01:04:29.230 align:start position:0%
Containment because the recovery Y is so
low

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
low
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
um there are costs that we often don't
 
01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
think of that come with this besides
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
lawyers and a diversion program um the
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
Investigations uh the cost of having
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
experts there are a number of costs that
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
representation uh finally I just want to
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
talk about that these choices have
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
lifelong consequences for these children
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
you heard testimony earlier that it
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
affects employment housing and education
 
01:05:04.589 --> 01:05:04.599 align:start position:0%
and what happens is is that uh the
 
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
choices made here really determine
 
01:05:09.069 --> 01:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
whether or not a child stays in the
 
01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
system and a child who stays in the
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
system is not contributing to society
 
01:05:16.109 --> 01:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
and that in the end ends up costing us
 
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
more money so once again not only is
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
this more fair and more just and more
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional but it really is a
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
cost-saving for the state of New
 
01:05:28.269 --> 01:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you and I'll take any
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%

defenders um I'm going to be honest um I
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot to add and I'm going to
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
um make my time here very brief because
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
we are really in agreement with um the
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
testimony of Mr Skiby um representative
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
walner and also the speaker from the
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
national juvenile Defender Center I am
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
going to submit some written testimony
 
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
however and that testimony includes a
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
couple of stories at the end um that I
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
hope that you can take a moment to
 
01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
review because um in preparing for this
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
I spoke with several attorneys both
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
public defenders and private lawyers who
 
01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
um practice regularly in the juvenile
 
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
courts and I think that these stories
 
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
really demonstrate um the need for
 
01:07:14.349 --> 01:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
ongoing um and early representation um
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
on the part of the children in the state
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to leave it at that unless
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%

members of the committee my name is

Michelle wangren and I'm the youth Law
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
Project Director at New Hampshire legal
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
assistance through that role I represent
 
01:08:42.269 --> 01:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
at risk and system involved youth to
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
help ensure their educational and other
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
needs are met and reduce the need for
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
court involvement prior to my role at
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
nhla I was an attorney at the New
 
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public defender and frequently
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
represented youth charged with
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
delinquency offenses I appear today on
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
behalf of nhla as well as the juvenile
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
reform project which you heard about
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
from Mike Skiby while I support this
 
01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
bill in its entirety to prevent
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
duplicating testimony this morning I
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
want to focus on two key pieces of
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
legislation section 4 paragraph 1A and
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
section six so section four paragraph 1
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
a starts on page two line 24 and it
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
really does two things first it allows
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys to participate in
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
ancillary proceedings when those
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
proceedings are based on the same
 
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
factual circumstances as the delinquency
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
petition and then second it extends the
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
appointment of council until the
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
juvenile's case closes regarding the
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
ancillary proceedings simply put this
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
provision permits defense councel to use
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
their judgment to ensure they provide
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
youth effective assistance of councel

necessary or appropriate for the

attorney or investigator to attend all

such meetings it must be within the

attorney's professional judgment to
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
determine what competence requires in a

given case and without arbitrary con
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
constraint this provision takes a
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
critical step in allowing all juvenile
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys to exercise that
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
professional judgment for instance under
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
current standard it standards it's a
 
01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
violation of conditional release for
 
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
youth to be suspended or expelled from
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
school a youth may have any number of
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
factual legal or disability based
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
reasons to over overcome the underlying
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
expulsion but without legal assistance
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
available to dispute or at least advise
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
the youth through that process any
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to dispute the violation of
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
conditional releases dead in the water
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
current practice discourages defense
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
attorneys from even attending ancillary
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
proceedings such as school discipline
 
01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
proceedings or related meetings well
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not necessary to attend
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
every such proceeding in every case it's
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
critically important that internal
 
01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
policies or procedures do not constrain
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
the professional Judgment of attorneys
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
to decide what's required in an

case and second section 4 amended
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%

01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
of council to remain in effect until

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
are only reopened immediately before any

subsequent hearings that could be three

or six months down the road at best in
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
the wake of the covid-19 pandemic this
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
practice was immediately recognized as
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
unfathomable as it pertains to youth in
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
out- of Home placements stakeholders
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
agreed that that with the added risks of
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
congregate care placement during the
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic are worthy to access to an
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
attorney but the need for a child's
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
voice voice after disposition doesn't
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
stop when the pandemic ends and was
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
highlighted as a systemic failure in our
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
state by the national juvenile Defender
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
Center I'll start by saying that a
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
child's removal from home is nothing
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
short of traumatizing regardless of the
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances leading to placement it's
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
often the first time they find
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
themselves without a friend without a
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
trusted adult and without the
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
possibility of even an Embrace by their
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
family how that child will respond is
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
unpredictable they could withdraw into
 
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
themselves they could begin quietly
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
self-harming or they could lash out
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
everyone around them but once their
 
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
attorney leaves them there's nobody left
 
01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
to advocate for them as an attorney
 
01:12:32.669 --> 01:12:32.679 align:start position:0%
frequently working with youth I know
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
that even when children are struggling
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
they forget to reach out to those they
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
know will advocate for them but if their
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
attorney checks in with them they will
 
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
typically talk freely and gladly accept
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
help to get out of often dire
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances when their behaviors are
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
perceived as shortcomings of their
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
character rather than reactions to their
 
01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
circumstances they may be isolated
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
restrained or transferred to more and
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
more restrictive placements even when
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
these children have involved parents
 
01:12:58.590 --> 01:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
their parents are not always effective
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
nor do they have the ability or know how
 
01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
to access the court if warranted the
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
child is left with no Advocate to
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
proactively ensure their needs are met
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
their services are provided or that they
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
have keiss plans designed to help them
 
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
return home in my practice I've worked
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
with children who are struggling in
 
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
their core ordered residential
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
placements only to find out necessary
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
special education services have been
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
removed to meet the needs of the
 
01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
placement without any prior discussion
 
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
about whether it was an educationally
 
01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:26.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate placement to begin with even
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
worse some children's IEPs are sarily
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
removed altogether shortly after they
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
enter placement even if a residential
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
school is able to meet the child's needs
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
through its nature as a self-contained
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
special education School removing the
 
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
IEP hinders this child's successful
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
transition back into public school now
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
while these issues may not be the role
 
01:13:46.629 --> 01:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
of the attorney to fully resolve
 
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
independently discovering that a
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
placement turns out to be wholly
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for a child is certainly
 
01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
worthy of raising with the court
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
immediately rather than waiting for a
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
hearing 6 months down the road by which
 
01:13:59.470 --> 01:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
point the child could have disengaged
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
altogether or Worse picked up new
 
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
charges ensuring the child is in an
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate placement is good for the
 
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
child good for the family and prevents
 
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
waste of State dollars on inappropriate
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
and ineffective programming the same
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
holds true for children who have not yet
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
been removed from their home the very
 
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
first stated purpose of RSA 169b is to
 
01:14:19.229 --> 01:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
facilitate the minor development by
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
providing the protection care treatment
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
counseling supervision and
 
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative resources that a child
 
01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.590 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative resources that a child
needs

01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
if a child doesn't have access to
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate resources research is clear
 
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
that they will sink deeper and deeper
 
01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
into the system a competent and involved
 
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
attorney can help ensure they have
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
access to appropriate Services before
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
the child reaches a Breaking Point and
 
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
faces residential placement minimally
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
rather than closing the case until the
 
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
worst happens the attorney should remain
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
apprised of the case status and any need
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
for intervention or court-based
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
advocacy then the last point that I want
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
to make today um or actually so the last
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
Point actually on section four for is
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
that it's not entirely clear to me what
 
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
page two line 30 is designed to address
 
01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
and representative bur had addressed
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
this earlier um that that taking on the
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
added costs may be too big of a lift um
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
but I do want to just point out that
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
last year the general court eliminated
 
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
the parental reimbursement structure in
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
juvenile delinquency proceedings and
 
01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
this bill eliminates the reimbursement
 
01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
for juvenile Council um so I'm not sure
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
what costs are left that the juvenile
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
may be responsible for other than the
 
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
possibility of a restitution payment and
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
if that's the issue that this language
 
01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
is designed to address I would just
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
recommend amending the line to take out
 
01:15:38.629 --> 01:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
costs and fees and to replace it with
 
01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
restitution if there are other some
 
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
other costs that I'm not thinking of
 
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
then then that should certainly be
 
01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
considered as
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
well and then finally I just want to
 
01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
touch upon section six which starts at
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
the top of Page Three the section
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
prohibits the use of uncons statements
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
at a juvenile trial and one of the ndc's
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
greatest concerns about New Hampshire
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
system was our late appointment of
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
council with which attorney Skiby spoke
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
about um earlier and in his testimony
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
you heard about the need for timely
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
appointment of Council in an ordinary
 
01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
case but this provision um section six
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
provides an added layer of protection
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
research is clear that kids are
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
particularly vulnerable to the influence
 
01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
of adult Authority and do not understand
 
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
the implications of making a statement
 
01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
to the police this is couple by the fact
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
that children in general and children
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
with disabilities in particular are much
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
more likely than adults to face to make
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
false confessions children easily
 
01:16:35.709 --> 01:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
believe that if they are just
 
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
Cooperative adults and Authority will
 
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
help them but oftentimes that's simply
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
not the case even when children receive
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
leniency for cooperating they typically
 
01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
still enter the system and entering the
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
system exponentially increases the odds
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
of remaining in it indefinitely dropping
 
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
out of school and entering the adult
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system this provision
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
would provide the most basic protection
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
that prior to making an admissible
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
statement the child would have the right
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
to consult with
 
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
counsel such a consultation would help
 
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
them understand if the information
 
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
they're providing would be helpful to
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
the police or incriminating to the child
 
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
this is a good thing for the system as
 
01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
you heard before early appointment of
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
council helps the system be more
 
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
efficient if its information law
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement is after an attorney could
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
help the child negotiate an agreement to
 
01:17:20.629 --> 01:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
provide that information in exchange for
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
a developmentally appropriate program
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
for instance or the attorney could simp
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
help the child understand the benefits
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
and consequences of cooperating with an
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
investigation to ensure the child's
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
choice is
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
informed in the interest of time I'm
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
just going to Li my comments to that but
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
for all these reasons and all the
 
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
reasons you've heard from other
 
01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
Advocates today I urge this committee to
 
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
vote out to pass for HB to on HB 188 and
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions that you
 
01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.470 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions that you
may

01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much are there any
 
01:17:59.950 --> 01:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
long representative long thank you madam
 
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
chair uh uh thank you uh Miss
 
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
wangelin uh so I was under the
 
01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
understanding also that last term the
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
cost the costs are no longer in
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
effect um so so what you're saying here
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
to um change on line 30 cost and fees to
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
restitution um if we change it to just
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
restitution is there any other fee or
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
something else that may come up none
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
that I can think of but again I'm not
 
01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
sure what the intent of that line was
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
and so um I don't know if representative
 
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
Burch or other members of the judicial
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
Council had in mind what other costs
 
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
that might entail but I can't think of
 
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
any costs that would remain other than
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
restitution to a family okay very good
 
01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:58.430 align:start position:0%
restitution to a family okay very good
thank

01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.669 --> 01:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
you thank you are there any further
 
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very

very much we we can't we can't see the
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
screen so we can't adjust our names okay
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
and we're on limited time yes thank you
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair um it's good to see all the
 
01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee again for the
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
record I'm Moira O'Neal I'm the State
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
child advocate um and in the interest of
 
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
time I will provide an very abrid
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
version of the testimony I have already
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
submitted in writing um this bill has
 
01:19:53.229 --> 01:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
been well supported this morning in the
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
and um I just want to reiterate two
 
01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
areas one is about um understanding the
 
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
development of children's brains and
 
01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
also the circumstances of children and
 
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
their families regarding brain
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
development you heard Mr skibby describe
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
the high incidents of disability amongst
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
children involved in the Juvenile
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
Justice System some would argue that a
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
naturally undeveloped brain is a kind of
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
disability in itself and I know many of
 
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
you know adolescent boys and girls and
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
you may agree with me on that um absent
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
councel the average child is at greater
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
risk of waving their rights agreeing to
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
conditions impinging upon their Liberty
 
01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
or making decisions that significantly
 
01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:37.639 align:start position:0%
impact their future we know from very
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
elegant Imaging studies and other
 
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
research that the frontal lobe of the
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
brain including the prefrontal cortex is
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
still developing well into the mid 20s
 
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
so that structure and function of the
 
01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
that part of the brain is determining
 
01:20:56.669 --> 01:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
how a young person 's ability to think
 
01:20:59.950 --> 01:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
critically and to reason is played out
 
01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
so the lack of development in that area
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
is often cited as to explain the
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
antisocial behavior that children bring
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
themselves into the juvenile justice
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
system to begin with and it's that same
 
01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
underdevelopment of the brain that
 
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
places a child at risk of providing
 
01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
false statements or confessions without
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
understanding the consequences of what
 
01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
they're saying and often allowing
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
themselves to be influenced to just
 
01:21:24.189 --> 01:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
agree to people um so that they can get
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
through interview with the law
 
01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement or
 
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
prosecutors um so it's really important
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
that representation is there to protect
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
them um regarding the circumstances of
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
Children and Families you heard a little
 
01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
bit about this today but I want to
 
01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:39.719 align:start position:0%
reiterate the high incidence of
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
Behavioral disability among these
 
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
children puts them at considerable risk
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
for antagonistic relationships with
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
their parents or their caregivers
 
01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
there's also a large population of
 
01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
children in New Hampshire who are
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
considered what we call crossover youth
 
01:21:57.550 --> 01:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
they are actually abused and neglected
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
children whose behavior is a response to
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
their B treatment um and we also know
 
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
there's an overrepresentation of
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
children from impoverished circumstances
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
whose parents May encounter significant
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
barriers to appearing at court um and
 
01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
supporting them because of lack of
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
Transportation or work obligations so
 
01:22:19.149 --> 01:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
all of those children are highly likely
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
to be navigating legal systems without
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
the support of engaged and protective
 
01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
parents or caregivers um and so the need
 
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
for professional U Advocates um and
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
representation is really critical for
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
them the most common complaint that we
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
hear from children when we visit at the
 
01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
sonunu you Services Center or other
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
residential facilities where children
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
are placed is that no one listens to
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
them we're often astounded when we say
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
what would you where do you see yourself
 
01:22:50.669 --> 01:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
what would you like to happen and we
 
01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
just get blank stairs and the children
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
invariably tell us I don't no no one has
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
ever asked me that question they really
 
01:22:59.950 --> 01:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
are left out of the process and once
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
their attorneys are gone from the
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
initial uh delinquency proceedings they
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
don't you know they may have a visit
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
from a jppo a juvenile probation parole
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
officer once a month but they don't have
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
someone who's really engaged with them
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
and making sure that their needs are met
 
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
appointing legal counsel from the very
 
01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
beginning for the life of life of a case
 
01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
increases the chances that children are
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
going to be heard um and we we rely find
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
that children make very reasonable often
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
self-preserving suggestions for their
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
care um so early and consistent legal
 
01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
counsel for the life of a case will
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
ensure that they're listened to and that
 
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
they receive any related necessary
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
children in New Hampshire deserve to
 
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
grow and learn in an environment free
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
from violence unfortunately we cannot
 
01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
guarantee that for every child and the
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
place where they should be the most
 
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
protected and safe their home can be a
 
01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
place of physical sexual and emotional
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
abuse or tragic neglect as a state we've
 
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
made a sincere effort in putting
 
01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
supports in place to help families
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
create and sustain safe and nurturing
 
01:26:53.189 --> 01:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
homes but not everyone is successful in
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
that endeavor and the state must step in
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
to protect those children when a child
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
is taken into State custody it is a
 
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
serious decision that is not done in
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
haste a child removed from their home

trauma of being taken from their home
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
the reasons for removing a child are
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%

discomfort that is a description of
 
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
trauma nothing in that description is an
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
appro apprpriate standard of care for
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
children in state custody it should be
 
01:29:31.390 --> 01:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
the goal of the state to put an end to
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
the infliction of trauma on its children
 
01:29:36.910 --> 01:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
not engage in violence or condone it in
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
any form therefore I submit House Bill

427 as a step towards ending violence
 
01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:45.880 align:start position:0%

February 19th 2020 it sub subsequently

11th of 2020 on a Voice vote
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately after covid-19 struck our
 
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
state this bill was not chosen to be
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
absorbed in any of the Senate Omnibus
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%

bill but he's speaking as a member of
 
01:31:21.629 --> 01:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
the public so it takes a little to get
 
01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:25.880 align:start position:0%

issues in the past years and it's uh

01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
you've heard a three-term member of this
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
particular committee this fine committee
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
my interest in the problems associated
 
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
with corporal punishment of children
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
extends back decades when I became aware
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
of the groundbreaking research of Dr
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
Murray Strauss at
 
01:32:35.229 --> 01:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
UNH the topic can raise strong feelings
 
01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
both pro and con based on personal
 
01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
experience and family
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
history but over the past three and a
 
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
half decades research has demonstrated
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
the corporal punishment as a method of
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
controlling children's behavior is not
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
only not effective in in the long run
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
but is associated with long-term serious
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
consequences which have very significant
 
01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:03.070 align:start position:0%
consequences which have very significant
social

01:33:03.070 --> 01:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
social
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
costs there is strong evidence that
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment places children at
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
risk for physical injury poor mental
 
01:33:15.109 --> 01:33:15.119 align:start position:0%

01:33:18.669 --> 01:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
development antisocial behavior and
 
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:20.360 align:start position:0%

01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.629 --> 01:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
you will hear more about this in the
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
accompanying testimony from
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
International expert Dr DAV David fleor
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
of unh he will bear these out in more
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
detail significant studies show us that
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
the use of corporal punishment is
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
prevalent in our country again Dr finle
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
hor recent study shows that young
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
children in particular are subjected to
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
Corporal punish ment regularly and it
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
continues on into
 
01:34:02.669 --> 01:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
adolescence as you heard last year I
 
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
introduced this particular piece of
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
legislation for several years I sat on
 
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation in an effort to find
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
the most appropriate approach to ensure
 
01:34:15.629 --> 01:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire would
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
clearly state that it does not condone
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
the use of corporal
 
01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
punishment last year the committee as
 
01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:24.830 align:start position:0%
punishment last year the committee as
you

01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly uh in the committee and
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
then passed it on to the house without
 
01:34:34.679 --> 01:34:36.189 align:start position:0%
then passed it on to the house without
any

01:34:36.189 --> 01:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
objection unfortunately the pandemic
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
prevented the Senate from taking up this
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
bill you may ask if this Corp if this
 
01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
legislation prohibits corporal
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
punishment in the home no it does not
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
prohibit use of corporal punishment in
 
01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:54.430 align:start position:0%
prohibit use of corporal punishment in
the

01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
home but with this legislation All State
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
agencies involved with children will
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
discourage the use of corporal
 
01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
punishment in its programs no matter if
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
these programs are in the public sector
 
01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
the private sector or carried out in
 
01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:13.990 align:start position:0%
the private sector or carried out in
private

01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
homes with all the accumulated
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence I ask this committee
 
01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
to again vote ought to pass and again
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
affirm that corporal punishment is not
 
01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
an acceptable method to control
 
01:35:29.719 --> 01:35:31.669 align:start position:0%
an acceptable method to control
children's

01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
children's
 
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%

Baran M chair representative liwicki
 
01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh Madam chair thank you Dr
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
Baran uh I have a question as to how
 
01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
prevalent is corporal punishment of poor
 
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
children who are in under State care is
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
this uh truly a common issue or is this
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
unnown or is it already prohibited thank
 
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
you um we we certainly don't have any
 
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
any um data in regard to that and we
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
have not perceived that it has been a
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
specific problem um but we know that
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
children who are in state care and are
 
01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
in foster homes are at times have been
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
subjected to things that we wish would
 
01:36:40.109 --> 01:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
not happen to children so I can't tell
 
01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
you that it is that there it is a
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
prevalent problem in children in state
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
care but we want to just be absolutely
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
certain that it doesn't happen to
 
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
them thank you Dr bar
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative Banger thank you madam
 
01:37:00.669 --> 01:37:00.679 align:start position:0%
chairwoman uh Dr Baran are you um aware
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
of any policies that are in place in
 
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
those state agencies that already have
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
um no corporal punishment in
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
place to my knowledge there's no
 
01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
specific policies I will tell you that
 
01:37:19.229 --> 01:37:19.239 align:start position:0%
certainly um in the uh division of
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
children youth and and families there
 
01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
are uh
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
practices that are encouraged which um
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh to use
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
alternative to Children's uh behavior
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
problems so um uh I'm I'm not aware of
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
specific policies that spell out uh
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment as being prohibited
 
01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
um rather I think the um agencies have
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
taken the approach of these are the ways
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
that one should um deal with children's
 
01:37:54.480 --> 01:38:01.229 align:start position:0%
that one should um deal with children's
behavior

01:38:01.229 --> 01:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
problems okay are there any further
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%

chair members of the committee for
 
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
having me back again to support Bill
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill 427 prohibiting corporal
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
punishment of children in state agency
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
programs um I will defer uh some of the
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
scientific information that we provided
 
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
in um this testimony that you have um in
 
01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
written form given the expertise that
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
you've heard um and and also coming um
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
but also Havey take questions about that
 
01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
um but I will we'll just in the interest
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
of time shorten my testimony today a bit
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
it's the office of the child Advocates
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
mandate to promote the best interest of
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
children and by prohibiting corporal
 
01:39:22.679 --> 01:39:23.870 align:start position:0%
children and by prohibiting corporal
punishment

01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
punishment
 
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
this bill protects children from the
 
01:39:27.229 --> 01:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences of
 
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment when cared for under
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
a state contract um currently however we
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
just want to point out that the
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
has very few contracts for services with
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
providers such as residential providers
 
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
for children um they only have
 
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
agreements or reimbursement arrangements
 
01:39:49.229 --> 01:39:49.239 align:start position:0%
so we would suggest including within the
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
definition of agency those entities that
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
have an agreement with the Department of
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and the
 
01:39:57.589 --> 01:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Education just to be sure
 
01:39:58.750 --> 01:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
covered so I want to comment on what we
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
know about adverse childhood experiences
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
that you've heard from representative
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
iller and honorable skip Baran um
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
largely because in these conversations
 
01:40:13.629 --> 01:40:13.639 align:start position:0%
you typically will often hear a response
 
01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
where someone says well my parents used
 
01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment on me and I turned
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
out okay um in the past two decades we
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
have learned so much about the relation
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
a ship between these negative
 
01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:27.639 align:start position:0%
experiences and lifelong problems like
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
heart disease obesity and depression all
 
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
outcomes that none of us would have
 
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
anticipated or associated with corporal
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
punishment so there are things that
 
01:40:40.109 --> 01:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
happen to people in their lives because
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
of these experiences as children um that
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
you might not associate as a bad outcome
 
01:40:48.189 --> 01:40:48.199 align:start position:0%
um but furthermore as as we all aim to
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
invest in New Hampshire's future through
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
its children it's important to note that
 
01:40:54.350 --> 01:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment has been found to
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
impact a child's cognitive function and
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
learning so the verbal methods of
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
discipline in which caregivers seek to
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
help children reason or explain the
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
problem with their behavior can actually
 
01:41:08.910 --> 01:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
stimulate cognitive cognitive function
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what we want we want
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
children's brains to grow not to recede
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
in their growth healthy childhood
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
development is Reliant upon trusting
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
supportive relationships so children
 
01:41:23.589 --> 01:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
involved in foster care or state
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
sponsored institutional care are already
 
01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
vulnerable because of the adverse
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
experiences that brought them into the
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
system into State care we can't expect
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
them to build those trusting healing
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
relationships when the people whose job
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
it is to protect them in the child's
 
01:41:41.229 --> 01:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
view actually harm them so if we do
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
promote alternative practices for
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
discipline um we're not we're investing
 
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire's future um for optimal
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
outcomes for these children um we don't
 
01:41:53.870 --> 01:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
believe that there's any care Giver who
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
intends to harm a child when employing
 
01:41:58.350 --> 01:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment in fact we know that
 
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
most believe although erroneously the
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
use of corporal punishment will protect
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
children from harm by teaching them to
 
01:42:07.709 --> 01:42:07.719 align:start position:0%
curtail dangerous Behavior the fact is
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
the average parent or caregiver doesn't
 
01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
have the access to Empirical research or
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
scientific journals to understand these
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
outcomes so prohibiting the use of
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment and state sponsored
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
care positions the state to model best
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
practice for parents also holds the
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
state to a higher standard because the
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
state has access to the latest science
 
01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
in any situation where the state
 
01:42:33.149 --> 01:42:33.159 align:start position:0%
replaces parents or caregivers it's
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
essential that the state provides care
 
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
that's informed by empirical evidence
 
01:42:39.589 --> 01:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
and of the highest standards of
 
01:42:42.510 --> 01:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
care um finally we we while the office
 
01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate appreciates the
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
purpose behind the Amendments proposed
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
in the second section of HB 427 we know
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
that there are some inconsistencies in
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
RSA 62 76 that's the criminal code that
 
01:42:57.790 --> 01:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
could be similarly amended to ensure
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
positive Child Development um it may be
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
something that the committee wants to um
 
01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
consider going forward um but otherwise
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
we support um House Bill 427 um and urge
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
your uh support for it as well with the
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
alteration of the definition of agency
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
um to include those entities that have
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
agreements with the Department of Health
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%

my name is Amanda Elizabeth tol and I'm
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
co-sponsoring HB 427 a bill to prohibit
 
01:45:30.270 --> 01:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment against children in
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
state care I'm co-sponsoring this bill
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
because I believe that New Hampshire's
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
governing bodies have a moral imperative
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
to act to keep our residents safe
 
01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
especially our children in state care
 
01:45:45.629 --> 01:45:45.639 align:start position:0%
who are our youngest and most vulnerable
 
01:45:45.639 --> 01:45:46.550 align:start position:0%
who are our youngest and most vulnerable

sters corporal punishment against
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
children is a tragedy that severely
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
damages both their physical and their
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
emotional well-being this is a fact
 
01:45:57.550 --> 01:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
supported by Major children's rights

Advocates including the American Academy
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
of Pediatrics the science is clear
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
children who are taught that violence is
 
01:46:07.629 --> 01:46:07.639 align:start position:0%
a solution are overwhelmingly more
 
01:46:09.669 --> 01:46:09.679 align:start position:0%
likely to become aggressive adults and
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
themselves violent perpetrators Banning
 
01:46:14.189 --> 01:46:14.199 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment against children is
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
not a new idea many countries across the
 
01:46:19.709 --> 01:46:19.719 align:start position:0%
world have banned this practice
 
01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
including many democracies such as
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
Sweden France Germany Finland Denmark
 
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
and Iceland and Norway just to name a
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
few the idea of Legally harming children
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
in state care children who are often
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
poor and are disproportionately likely
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
to have experienced previous trauma is
 
01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
appalling I think the vast majority of
 
01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire constituents regardless of
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
party affiliation would support this
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
bill we share the fundamental belief
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
that our children should be kept safe I
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
cannot emphasize this enough children
 
01:46:59.950 --> 01:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
who are under the care of the state have
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
already experienced some form of trauma
 
01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
it is the responsibility of the State of
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to protect our children
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
from any more physical emotional or
 
01:47:14.109 --> 01:47:14.119 align:start position:0%

darkmouth um I believe uh and literature
 
01:48:22.350 --> 01:48:22.360 align:start position:0%
uh supports that the more violence there
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
is uh in any Community the more Corporal
 
01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
in are you
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
there indicate that uh 80 to 90% of
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
families in the United States approve of
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment uh in the family
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
against children uh however again uh
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
research both in the United States and
 
01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
in many other countries uh show that
 
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment in fact has only one
 
01:49:06.750 --> 01:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
positive uh impact on the outcome
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
compared to 10 other impacts which uh
 
01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
end up with uh very negative outcomes
 
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
The only positive impact of corporal
 
01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
punishment is immediate immediate comp
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
compliance with what the caretaker is
 
01:49:30.629 --> 01:49:30.639 align:start position:0%
requesting on the other hand
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
um other things that we would like to
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
come out of child discipline positive
 
01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:40.360 align:start position:0%
child discipline are impacted very
 
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
negatively uh the child morally
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
internalizes that it is okay uh to hit
 
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
other people when they don't comply with
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
what you want the quality of the
 
01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
relationship between the child and the
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
caretakers uh is impacted very
 
01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
negatively child's mental health is
 
01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
affected negatively which leads to poor
 
01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
adult mental health as a result of
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment becoming one of the
 
01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences as uh
 
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
multiple individuals mentioned this
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
morning child becomes more aggressive
 
01:50:24.750 --> 01:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
because they roll model after their
 
01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
caretaker who is acting as an aggressor
 
01:50:30.510 --> 01:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
rather than an educator in their
 
01:50:33.629 --> 01:50:33.639 align:start position:0%
relationship with the child child
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
internalizes antisocial behaviors as
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
they grow up and they become violent
 
01:50:42.990 --> 01:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who also uh approve of
 
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.310 align:start position:0%
individuals who also uh approve of
corporal

01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
corporal
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
punishment which has a very fine line uh
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
toward physical abuse uh obviously
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment almost
 
01:50:59.470 --> 01:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly all the time occurs as a
 
01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
result of the caretaker being very angry
 
01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
with the child's behavior and there is
 
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
no guarantee that a child who is
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
corporally punished will not be
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
physically abused uh if the caretaker uh
 
01:51:14.639 --> 01:51:15.910 align:start position:0%
physically abused uh if the caretaker uh
loses

01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
loses
 
01:51:19.950 --> 01:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
control um and as I mentioned uh these
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
children uh tend to grow up to become
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
adult aggressors adults with antisocial
 
01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
behaviors and with Tendencies to abuse
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
their own child and even their spouse
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
when literature has supported all of
 
01:51:40.990 --> 01:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
these uh as a Child Abuse Prevention
 
01:51:45.390 --> 01:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
worker uh I have always been against any
 
01:51:46.830 --> 01:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
kind of corporal
 
01:51:50.589 --> 01:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
punishment uh but in the context of this
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
house uh bill
 
01:51:56.589 --> 01:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
uh the State starting taking the steps
 
01:51:59.550 --> 01:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
toward Banning corporal punishment at
 
01:52:03.629 --> 01:52:03.639 align:start position:0%
least in state agencies and in uh Foster
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
placement is not only going to be a
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
wonderful step toward educating our
 
01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
entire state
 
01:52:17.069 --> 01:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
population but also will role model
 
01:52:20.669 --> 01:52:20.679 align:start position:0%
toward uh foster parents
 
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:23.560 align:start position:0%
observing how things move more
 
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
positively when they do not use corporal
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
punishment with their foster children I
 
01:52:33.870 --> 01:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
am hoping that they will also become
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
individuals practicing positive
 
01:52:39.790 --> 01:52:39.800 align:start position:0%
parenting with their own children and
 
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
will voluntarily choose not to use
 
01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment with their own

01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
will have to pull the actual rules and
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
compare the language to say that it's
 
01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
identical okay and you'll be sending
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
that to us correct yes okay thank you
 
01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:54.910 align:start position:0%
that to us correct yes okay thank you
you're

01:54:54.910 --> 01:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:54:58.629 --> 01:54:58.639 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you representative Banger
 
01:54:59.870 --> 01:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
chairwoman um Miss Ross question to you
 
01:55:06.189 --> 01:55:06.199 align:start position:0%
um in order to obtain a license these
 
01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
residential programs um in foster care
 
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
programs are they required to adhere to
 
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:19.950 --> 01:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
427 um yes so they're they're informed
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
and trained on the rules and what the
 
01:55:24.270 --> 01:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
requirements are in need to agree to
 
01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:27.320 align:start position:0%
that to obtain a license and then if
 
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
they were to in fact violate those rules
 
01:55:32.069 --> 01:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
once there were licensed and a child was
 
01:55:34.510 --> 01:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
placed then we would have the ability to
 
01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
investigate and take action on that
 
01:55:38.189 --> 01:55:38.199 align:start position:0%
license if they were
 
01:55:41.830 --> 01:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
inconsistent follow up follow up so just
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
to be clear if they um did not adhere to
 
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
those policies and guidelines set by the
 
01:55:48.910 --> 01:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
division they would in fact lose their
 
01:55:53.149 --> 01:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:57.069 --> 01:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
it would depend um obviously there's you
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
know a lot of facts that this would
 
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
depend on but certainly um the most
 
01:56:06.189 --> 01:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
extreme result would be loss of that
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
license or revocation there could also
 
01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:10.679 align:start position:0%
be a corrective action plan if there was
 
01:56:13.950 --> 01:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
a misunderstanding or um lack of clarity
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't want to say that every
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
time the issue raised it would
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
automatically result in a loss of a
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
license they would have process they
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
would have a right to a hearing to
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not they did in
 
01:56:28.109 --> 01:56:28.119 align:start position:0%
fact violate the rules but essentially
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
if someone is not going to agree to not
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
use corporal punishment they would not
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
be licensed they would not be able to
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
maintain a license they would not be an
 
01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:36.510 align:start position:0%
maintain a license they would not be an
appropriate

01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate

all Associated cost is completely can
 
02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
you hear me now additional cost in other
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
words it could give the impression that
 
02:28:48.670 --> 02:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
the cost of the contract is much higher
 
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
than it it truly is or new C uh cost now
 
02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
if the legislation is aimed at giving
 
02:28:57.630 --> 02:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
the public a chance to oppose a contract
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason then it's important

for a fiscal note they never it um
 
03:32:47.990 --> 03:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
and I just think it's the responsible
 
03:32:50.910 --> 03:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
thing to do yeah no I agree I mean
 
03:32:53.590 --> 03:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
although we're just a policy yeah yeah
 
03:32:55.670 --> 03:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
why not right but I don't want to send
 
03:32:57.870 --> 03:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
it on and have it get killed because it
 
03:33:00.429 --> 03:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't have it do you know what I mean
 
03:33:03.790 --> 03:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
I sure that way it can go to finance and
 
03:33:07.229 --> 03:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
they can put the money there for it so I
 
03:33:09.429 --> 03:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
would okay I would feel
 
03:33:13.790 --> 03:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
better so um would anyone else like to
 
03:33:18.309 --> 03:33:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:18.319 --> 03:33:19.710 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:33:19.710 --> 03:33:19.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:33:23.189 --> 03:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
AEL yes um let me lower my hand thank
 
03:33:26.830 --> 03:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
you Madame chairwoman I'm just curious
 
03:33:30.750 --> 03:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
while it's at LBA are we do we have to
 
03:33:34.349 --> 03:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
just put a pin in it exec it later or
 
03:33:37.590 --> 03:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
can we move forward and then whatever
 
03:33:40.870 --> 03:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
comes from LBA send it along to
 
03:33:43.830 --> 03:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
finance just procedurally how do we but
 
03:33:46.510 --> 03:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to execute today anyway
 
03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
but so I get a more definite I mean it
 
03:33:50.870 --> 03:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
would have to go quickly
 
03:33:53.229 --> 03:33:53.239 align:start position:0%
because it would be a sec then a second
 
03:33:55.309 --> 03:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
committee bill which honestly is why I
 
03:33:58.910 --> 03:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
originally scheduled it first because um
 
03:34:01.630 --> 03:34:01.640 align:start position:0%
I really thought it would would go to
 
03:34:05.110 --> 03:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
finance um so but I've already spoken to
 
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
the speaker um and said you know I want
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
this to to go there I I just think it's
 
03:34:14.910 --> 03:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do so um do does
 
03:34:16.469 --> 03:34:16.479 align:start position:0%

03:34:21.030 --> 03:34:21.040 align:start position:0%

consideration House Bill 254
 
03:39:46.040 --> 03:39:47.150 align:start position:0%
consideration House Bill 254
in

03:39:47.150 --> 03:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:39:50.309 --> 03:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
2017 we had a very long and lengthy
 
03:39:51.990 --> 03:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing on a bill that would
 
03:39:56.229 --> 03:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce the the size of the
 
03:39:59.429 --> 03:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
number of kids placed at the cuni
 
03:40:02.870 --> 03:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
Center and at that time I was
 
03:40:05.710 --> 03:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
significantly opposed to the end result
 
03:40:07.469 --> 03:40:07.479 align:start position:0%
because I was deeply
 
03:40:11.429 --> 03:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
concerned that we would have a lot of
 
03:40:13.750 --> 03:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
Youth running the
 
03:40:15.710 --> 03:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
streets without having having the
 
03:40:17.950 --> 03:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
services they needed in their
 
03:40:20.830 --> 03:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
communities to help keep the public and
 
03:40:22.469 --> 03:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
the kids
 
03:40:26.830 --> 03:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
safe much to my joy I was proven
 
03:40:29.830 --> 03:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
wrong this has been tremendously
 
03:40:34.030 --> 03:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
successful for these kids they um as of
 
03:40:36.630 --> 03:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
today I believe the the number of kids
 
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
placed at the senuna Youth Services
 
03:40:42.510 --> 03:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
Center is eight as opposed to the over
 
03:40:46.590 --> 03:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
100 kids that were there in 2017
 
03:40:51.790 --> 03:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
what HB 254 does is um adds more
 
03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
offenses to the list that kids sh can be
 
03:40:58.830 --> 03:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
placed out in their communities getting
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
services in the communities they know
 
03:41:02.910 --> 03:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
rather than being committed to the
 
03:41:02.920 --> 03:41:04.110 align:start position:0%
rather than being committed to the
sununu

03:41:04.110 --> 03:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
sununu
 
03:41:08.790 --> 03:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
center um I'd also like to um bring
 
03:41:12.110 --> 03:41:12.120 align:start position:0%

to make it so that the kids that are
 
03:41:29.189 --> 03:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
detained at cunu can also be
 
03:41:32.229 --> 03:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
um cannot be detained for these same
 
03:41:34.870 --> 03:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
offenses but it's going to put it out
 
03:41:36.870 --> 03:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
six months later than the effective date
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
so that the courts
 
03:41:43.590 --> 03:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
um have time to you know get used to
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
what's going on and and make the the
 
03:41:48.309 --> 03:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
changes that they need
 
03:41:48.319 --> 03:41:50.229 align:start position:0%
changes that they need
um

03:41:50.229 --> 03:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:53.550 --> 03:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
and so that's really about it I have
 
03:41:56.510 --> 03:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
more people that will have you know more
 
03:41:59.790 --> 03:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
answers to your questions when when they
 
03:42:02.790 --> 03:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
testify so I'm going to defer to them
 
03:42:07.269 --> 03:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
but um when this was brought to my
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
attention I was very happy to sponsor it
 
03:42:14.229 --> 03:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
because I was so dead set against it
 
03:42:16.590 --> 03:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
before but I am I'm very happy that I
 
03:42:19.149 --> 03:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
was wrong and I say that it's really
 
03:42:20.870 --> 03:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
important that we have these kids in
 
03:42:22.269 --> 03:42:22.279 align:start position:0%
their communities and now that the
 
03:42:26.189 --> 03:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
services are there more um I think it's
 
03:42:29.710 --> 03:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
important for the the kids going forward
 
03:42:31.910 --> 03:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
so on that
 
03:42:34.309 --> 03:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
note if you don't mind I would like to
 
03:42:36.990 --> 03:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
defer the questions to the person that's
 
03:42:39.269 --> 03:42:39.279 align:start position:0%
going to come on after
 
03:42:43.309 --> 03:42:43.319 align:start position:0%

House Bill
 
03:43:24.550 --> 03:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
254 uh as representative R just stated
 
03:43:26.110 --> 03:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
as relative to the placement of miners
 
03:43:27.950 --> 03:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
in insecure
 
03:43:31.389 --> 03:43:31.399 align:start position:0%
facilities um my testimony today will
 
03:43:33.269 --> 03:43:33.279 align:start position:0%
refer to the amendment that
 
03:43:35.389 --> 03:43:35.399 align:start position:0%
representative rice just spoke to the
 
03:43:37.950 --> 03:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
amendment replaces the entire uh bill
 
03:43:39.510 --> 03:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
and I will explain the differences
 
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
between the two and the reasoning uh
 
03:43:41.279 --> 03:43:42.590 align:start position:0%
between the two and the reasoning uh
behind

03:43:42.590 --> 03:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
behind
 
03:43:45.469 --> 03:43:45.479 align:start position:0%
it I come today representing w point and
 
03:43:49.070 --> 03:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
the juvenile reform project uh Waypoint
 
03:43:50.309 --> 03:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
which was formerly known as child and
 
03:43:50.319 --> 03:43:51.149 align:start position:0%
which was formerly known as child and
Family

03:43:51.149 --> 03:43:51.159 align:start position:0%
Family
 
03:43:54.510 --> 03:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
Services um has been an operation since
 
03:43:56.870 --> 03:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
1850 and you heard mention this morning
 
03:43:59.630 --> 03:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
by Mr skibby of the juvenile reform
 
03:44:02.229 --> 03:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
project I have forwarded testimony to
 
03:44:07.110 --> 03:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
all of you I'm going to do my best to um
 
03:44:09.710 --> 03:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
excerpt the testimony and not read
 
03:44:09.720 --> 03:44:13.550 align:start position:0%
excerpt the testimony and not read
it

03:44:13.550 --> 03:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:17.070 --> 03:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
um so to speak to the actual amendment
 
03:44:19.790 --> 03:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
to get into what this what this does and
 
03:44:22.710 --> 03:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
what this doesn't do there are three key
 
03:44:25.910 --> 03:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
sections three key sections in the
 
03:44:30.429 --> 03:44:30.439 align:start position:0%
amendment sections two three and
 
03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
four and I'm going to speak to them uh
 
03:44:36.309 --> 03:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to section four first because
 
03:44:39.389 --> 03:44:39.399 align:start position:0%
that's the perhaps the most impactful as
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative rice stated back in 2017
 
03:44:46.670 --> 03:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
this committee made changes to
 
03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
offenses whereby a child could be
 
03:44:53.469 --> 03:44:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:57.070 --> 03:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
Center this makes further changes to
 
03:44:58.710 --> 03:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
offenses that a child can be
 
03:45:00.870 --> 03:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for at the sen Services
 
03:45:06.950 --> 03:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
hour and what this does is it limits
 
03:45:06.960 --> 03:45:08.750 align:start position:0%
hour and what this does is it limits
incarceration

03:45:08.750 --> 03:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
incarceration
 
03:45:12.910 --> 03:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
to Serious violent offenses as outlined
 
03:45:15.030 --> 03:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
I won't go through the specific um
 
03:45:17.269 --> 03:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
offenses unless people have questions
 
03:45:20.189 --> 03:45:20.199 align:start position:0%
but they're outlined here I will point
 
03:45:24.030 --> 03:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
out to you that in the amendment um the
 
03:45:27.309 --> 03:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
bulk of section four is existing
 
03:45:30.630 --> 03:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
language the changes to the language
 
03:45:33.269 --> 03:45:33.279 align:start position:0%
begin down uh where it gets into the
 
03:45:35.309 --> 03:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
specific offenses but everything else in
 
03:45:38.790 --> 03:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
there uh should be existing language so
 
03:45:41.550 --> 03:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
as of January 1st of
 
03:45:45.510 --> 03:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
2022 this would go into effect if you um
 
03:45:48.389 --> 03:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
ordained to pass it and children who
 
03:45:51.750 --> 03:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
were committed would um have committed a
 
03:45:55.550 --> 03:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
a significant a higher level of
 
03:45:58.670 --> 03:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
offense going to section
 
03:46:02.670 --> 03:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
two section two is in regards to the
 
03:46:04.870 --> 03:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
Detention of
 
03:46:07.870 --> 03:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
children I I'm sure you all know this
 
03:46:09.429 --> 03:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
given being on this committee but I'll
 
03:46:12.030 --> 03:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
point it out that commitment is when the
 
03:46:15.269 --> 03:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
child is effectively convicted and
 
03:46:17.950 --> 03:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
incarcerated detention is when a child
 
03:46:21.550 --> 03:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
is held by court order while awaiting
 
03:46:26.269 --> 03:46:26.279 align:start position:0%
trial so in section two what that does
 
03:46:31.630 --> 03:46:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:34.469 --> 03:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
standards so today a child can be
 
03:46:36.830 --> 03:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
detained only for reasons that they can
 
03:46:39.110 --> 03:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
be committed is what the current
 
03:46:42.910 --> 03:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
language says um we want to
 
03:46:45.910 --> 03:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
maintain the the children who can be
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:53.750 --> 03:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
today for the first six months that this
 
03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
is in
 
03:46:57.790 --> 03:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
effect the reason for that and I'll get
 
03:46:59.710 --> 03:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
into some of the specific programs but
 
03:47:01.389 --> 03:47:01.399 align:start position:0%
the reason for that as representative
 
03:47:03.670 --> 03:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
rice stated is we would like to give the
 
03:47:07.630 --> 03:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
court and the department more time uh to
 
03:47:09.189 --> 03:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
roll out their system of care that
 
03:47:12.630 --> 03:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
they're working on now and more time to
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
um more time to acclimate to these
 
03:47:18.110 --> 03:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
changes so between January of 22 and
 
03:47:20.229 --> 03:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
July 1st of
 
03:47:23.830 --> 03:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
2022 any child who is detained today can
 
03:47:26.309 --> 03:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
be detained
 
03:47:30.030 --> 03:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
then section three which doesn't go into
 
03:47:33.309 --> 03:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
effect until July 1 of
 
03:47:38.149 --> 03:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
2022 says a child can only be detained
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
if they can be committed meaning it
 
03:47:41.870 --> 03:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
raises the the level for detention to
 
03:47:43.309 --> 03:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
the higher level offense as Inc
 
03:47:43.319 --> 03:47:46.149 align:start position:0%
the higher level offense as Inc
commitment

03:47:46.149 --> 03:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
the other pieces are the statement of
 
03:47:51.149 --> 03:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
findings and then the um the effective
 
03:47:55.269 --> 03:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:58.510 --> 03:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
does why is this why is this bill
 
03:48:01.309 --> 03:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
important well the bill is important for
 
03:48:03.950 --> 03:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
a for a number of reasons first as you
 
03:48:06.349 --> 03:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
heard the OCA testify this morning you
 
03:48:08.149 --> 03:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
also heard a number of other uh
 
03:48:13.189 --> 03:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
Witnesses testify that uh kids don't do
 
03:48:16.790 --> 03:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
well when they're in erated it is not an
 
03:48:16.800 --> 03:48:18.110 align:start position:0%
well when they're in erated it is not an
effective

03:48:18.110 --> 03:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
effective
 
03:48:21.790 --> 03:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
intervention generally for children and
 
03:48:23.670 --> 03:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
um there are there are significant
 
03:48:26.469 --> 03:48:26.479 align:start position:0%
adverse effects when children are
 
03:48:30.149 --> 03:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
incarcerated um Dropout rates increase
 
03:48:35.149 --> 03:48:35.159 align:start position:0%
we see um increased trauma uh we see
 
03:48:38.630 --> 03:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
kids often become more engaged with the
 
03:48:40.870 --> 03:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
adult correction
 
03:48:45.149 --> 03:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
system um and keep in mind that as uh
 
03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
the OCA also testified this morning a
 
03:48:49.950 --> 03:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
number of these children at sinunu are
 
03:48:52.070 --> 03:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
what she referred to as crossover kids
 
03:48:53.630 --> 03:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
I've never heard that but they're kids
 
03:48:55.870 --> 03:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
that grow out of the abuse neglect
 
03:48:59.149 --> 03:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
system and into the Juvenile Justice
 
03:49:02.030 --> 03:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
System it's important to keep in mind
 
03:49:04.469 --> 03:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
that as representative rice indicated in
 
03:49:07.030 --> 03:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
2017 there were significant questions
 
03:49:08.510 --> 03:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
about whether there were services to
 
03:49:10.189 --> 03:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
treat the kids that we were keeping out
 
03:49:10.199 --> 03:49:11.550 align:start position:0%
treat the kids that we were keeping out
of

03:49:11.550 --> 03:49:11.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
sonunu um that was uh that was a major
 
03:49:17.550 --> 03:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
topic of discussion what I would point
 
03:49:19.189 --> 03:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
out to you today is we're in a very
 
03:49:22.670 --> 03:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
different place um the fedal families
 
03:49:24.429 --> 03:49:24.439 align:start position:0%
first legislation went into effect a
 
03:49:27.389 --> 03:49:27.399 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago uh it's required to
 
03:49:29.830 --> 03:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
be fully implemented by October of this
 
03:49:33.429 --> 03:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
year what that requires is to treat
 
03:49:34.630 --> 03:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
children in the
 
03:49:37.870 --> 03:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
community unless um congregate care is
 
03:49:40.870 --> 03:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
the only solution it will it will
 
03:49:43.349 --> 03:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
emphasize community- based care which is
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
why you all uh two years ago enacted s
 
03:49:50.910 --> 03:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
sp14 the state system of care bill and
 
03:49:54.349 --> 03:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
um funded it with $20 million because
 
03:49:54.359 --> 03:49:55.110 align:start position:0%
um funded it with $20 million because
that

03:49:55.110 --> 03:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:49:58.550 --> 03:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
bill permits the department to build out
 
03:50:01.550 --> 03:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
its system of care in order to comply
 
03:50:03.510 --> 03:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
with the family first
 
03:50:06.309 --> 03:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
legislation I'll also say that the the
 
03:50:08.349 --> 03:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
broad system of care which focuses in
 
03:50:10.630 --> 03:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
the G on community based care is good
 
03:50:11.830 --> 03:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
for our
 
03:50:16.149 --> 03:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
kids and it will have a longas
 
03:50:18.870 --> 03:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
impact and that's why this time is right
 
03:50:21.229 --> 03:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
to bring this bill forward all of these
 
03:50:24.389 --> 03:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
things are coming online uh currently
 
03:50:27.189 --> 03:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
this legislation before you in fact uh
 
03:50:28.870 --> 03:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't become effective for several
 
03:50:30.750 --> 03:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
months after the system of care is built
 
03:50:32.469 --> 03:50:32.479 align:start position:0%
out so the system will be in a very
 
03:50:34.189 --> 03:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
different place than it was in
 
03:50:37.670 --> 03:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
2017 uh today we run between it you
 
03:50:39.389 --> 03:50:39.399 align:start position:0%
heard representative R say the senses is
 
03:50:41.670 --> 03:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
eight I've seen the senses as high as 15
 
03:50:44.110 --> 03:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
or 16 in the last you know six to eight
 
03:50:46.910 --> 03:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
months that's the the range it's been in
 
03:50:49.630 --> 03:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's been uh about half committed
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
kids and half detained kids
 
03:50:54.790 --> 03:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
typically what this legislation will
 
03:50:58.910 --> 03:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
likely do is at least have that
 
03:51:04.389 --> 03:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:08.269 --> 03:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
more um we believe that that this
 
03:51:10.830 --> 03:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
legislation creates an opportunity to
 
03:51:12.550 --> 03:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
continue to move away from the use of
 
03:51:14.030 --> 03:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
institutional and conate Care in the
 
03:51:14.040 --> 03:51:15.110 align:start position:0%
institutional and conate Care in the
state

03:51:15.110 --> 03:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:51:18.510 --> 03:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
and emphasize on treating kids in their
 
03:51:20.389 --> 03:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
Community because what we know is that
 
03:51:22.990 --> 03:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
any child committed to sinunu will be
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
returning to their community at some
 
03:51:27.309 --> 03:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
point they don't learn to be effective
 
03:51:29.830 --> 03:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
community members when they're in jail
 
03:51:31.469 --> 03:51:31.479 align:start position:0%
they learn to be effective community
 
03:51:35.429 --> 03:51:35.439 align:start position:0%
members by having supported um treatment
 
03:51:37.229 --> 03:51:37.239 align:start position:0%
in the community where they can actually
 
03:51:39.670 --> 03:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
try out what they're learning and so
 
03:51:42.030 --> 03:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
with that um I'm happy to answer any
 
03:51:44.110 --> 03:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
questions the committee might have and I
 
03:51:46.750 --> 03:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
would ask the committee to um please
 
03:51:49.790 --> 03:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
pass the um the legislation as as
 
03:51:52.189 --> 03:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
amended uh before
 
03:51:54.830 --> 03:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
much okay are there any questions for
 
03:52:04.110 --> 03:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
John Joy okay so we have representative
 
03:52:07.429 --> 03:52:07.439 align:start position:0%
long representative long thank you madam
 
03:52:11.750 --> 03:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
chair uh Mr Dy uh this has no effect on
 
03:52:14.670 --> 03:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
contracts without Estates correct with
 
03:52:18.389 --> 03:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:21.149 --> 03:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
Center um I'm not sure I understand the
 
03:52:22.469 --> 03:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
question representative could you
 
03:52:24.990 --> 03:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
rephrase that well well do if we
 
03:52:27.910 --> 03:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
contract with children being placed from
 
03:52:30.830 --> 03:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
out of state would this have an effect
 
03:52:34.389 --> 03:52:34.399 align:start position:0%
on them do would would they would we
 
03:52:36.229 --> 03:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
have you know so let's say there's a
 
03:52:39.469 --> 03:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
child in incarceration in
 
03:52:39.479 --> 03:52:41.189 align:start position:0%
child in incarceration in
Vermont

03:52:41.189 --> 03:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
03:52:45.870 --> 03:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't fall under any of these
 
03:52:48.990 --> 03:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
um would we be able to contract with
 
03:52:51.189 --> 03:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
them being at the sonuna
 
03:52:53.590 --> 03:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
center so you're talking about placing
 
03:52:55.309 --> 03:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh incarcerated kids from other states
 
03:52:57.910 --> 03:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
in the Sonona Center
 
03:53:02.590 --> 03:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
correct okay um so my understanding I am
 
03:53:05.469 --> 03:53:05.479 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer but my understanding is
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
that this applies to Children um
 
03:53:11.510 --> 03:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
arrested and convicted in the state of
 
03:53:11.520 --> 03:53:12.510 align:start position:0%
arrested and convicted in the state of
New

03:53:12.510 --> 03:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
New
 
03:53:15.510 --> 03:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I do not believe it applies to
 
03:53:17.950 --> 03:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
other contracts although I would defer
 
03:53:19.990 --> 03:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
to Mr ribom or someone else who who
 
03:53:23.870 --> 03:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
might have a better handle on that
 
03:53:27.710 --> 03:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm getting a text sorry um getting a
 
03:53:30.229 --> 03:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
text that I'm trying to interpret um so
 
03:53:32.389 --> 03:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't believe it stops kids
 
03:53:34.830 --> 03:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
from Vermont but representative long I
 
03:53:39.790 --> 03:53:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:42.510 --> 03:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you okay I'm being told
 
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
by an attorney I work with that my
 
03:53:47.630 --> 03:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
statement is correct that this does not
 
03:53:50.349 --> 03:53:50.359 align:start position:0%
impact kids from the contract bringing
 
03:53:52.110 --> 03:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
kids in from Vermont I would say for the
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
committee's benefit is my understanding
 
03:53:56.110 --> 03:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
that contract only extends till October
 
03:53:58.750 --> 03:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
of 2021 when Vermont expects to have
 
03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
their own program and this does not go
 
03:54:03.269 --> 03:54:03.279 align:start position:0%
into effect until
 
03:54:03.279 --> 03:54:05.110 align:start position:0%
into effect until
January

03:54:05.110 --> 03:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
January
 
03:54:10.110 --> 03:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:13.469 --> 03:54:13.479 align:start position:0%
testimony and uh representative

bill as it is being proposed to be
 
03:55:45.349 --> 03:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
modified by the chair's Amendment
 
03:55:46.790 --> 03:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
because it will reduce the use of the
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
sununu center um particularly for minor
 
03:55:52.389 --> 03:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
offenders which research shows is
 
03:55:54.269 --> 03:55:54.279 align:start position:0%
associated with lower recidivism and
 
03:55:56.229 --> 03:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
better outcomes for children families
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
and Public Safety um I'm not going to
 
03:56:02.309 --> 03:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
say very much because it's been said
 
03:56:06.389 --> 03:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
already and I don't want to um repeat um
 
03:56:07.630 --> 03:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
that testimony but I do want to
 
03:56:09.950 --> 03:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
emphasize a couple of things there's
 
03:56:11.790 --> 03:56:11.800 align:start position:0%
been some mention about how the effects
 
03:56:14.590 --> 03:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
of Correction placement for children can
 
03:56:17.309 --> 03:56:17.319 align:start position:0%
be quite negative it is especially
 
03:56:20.269 --> 03:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
negative for children who are minor
 
03:56:22.510 --> 03:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
offenders um the relationship between
 
03:56:25.349 --> 03:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
how we respond to minor offenses and how
 
03:56:28.030 --> 03:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
the kids who commit those offenses in
 
03:56:31.110 --> 03:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
the future is very striking um when
 
03:56:32.710 --> 03:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about Minor offenders as
 
03:56:35.070 --> 03:56:35.080 align:start position:0%
compared to to more serious offenders a
 
03:56:36.550 --> 03:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
child who's just starting to get into
 
03:56:38.189 --> 03:56:38.199 align:start position:0%
minor trouble is often someone who with
 
03:56:40.429 --> 03:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
the right intervention can do very well
 
03:56:41.950 --> 03:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
in the future and there's lots of
 
03:56:43.750 --> 03:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
stories of people who've had just minor
 
03:56:43.760 --> 03:56:44.870 align:start position:0%
stories of people who've had just minor
contact

03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
contact
 
03:56:46.550 --> 03:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
with the justice system who went on to
 
03:56:48.429 --> 03:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
live successful lives without further
 
03:56:50.750 --> 03:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
Court involvement those interventions
 
03:56:52.389 --> 03:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
are often most successful when they do
 
03:56:53.950 --> 03:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
not remove a child from their home in
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
school because those removals can weaken
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
and sever the connections that are
 
03:57:00.670 --> 03:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
protective against antisocial Behavior
 
03:57:03.469 --> 03:57:03.479 align:start position:0%
now those are connections with peers who
 
03:57:06.630 --> 03:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
are pro-social with your own family with
 
03:57:09.269 --> 03:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
teachers and coaches at school who are
 
03:57:12.269 --> 03:57:12.279 align:start position:0%
um providing helpful guidance to a child
 
03:57:13.710 --> 03:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
particularly a child with a disability
 
03:57:15.189 --> 03:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
who may be risk of
 
03:57:17.309 --> 03:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
delinquency these effects are less
 
03:57:19.110 --> 03:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
striking however with more serious
 
03:57:20.950 --> 03:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
offenders who may need more intense
 
03:57:23.670 --> 03:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
interventions so there it is definitely
 
03:57:26.149 --> 03:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
true that Corrections placement should
 
03:57:29.830 --> 03:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
be um avoided whenever possible when
 
03:57:31.790 --> 03:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary to protect the child
 
03:57:34.429 --> 03:57:34.439 align:start position:0%
or to protect the community but the the
 
03:57:35.870 --> 03:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
difference is most striking when you're
 
03:57:38.349 --> 03:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
talking about the kinds of offenders
 
03:57:39.990 --> 03:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill would remove from
 
03:57:42.309 --> 03:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
eligibility for placement at the sununu
 
03:57:45.229 --> 03:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
center and that's um that's one of the
 
03:57:47.149 --> 03:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
reasons that uh we strongly support this
 
03:57:47.159 --> 03:57:48.830 align:start position:0%
reasons that uh we strongly support this
bill

03:57:48.830 --> 03:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:57:52.990 --> 03:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that everything else has been
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
said um I I just comment that New
 
03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's reduced use of interventions
 
03:58:02.030 --> 03:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
like the cunu
 
03:58:04.710 --> 03:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
center um runs in parallel with what has
 
03:58:08.990 --> 03:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
been happening nationally um um from
 
03:58:12.550 --> 03:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
2003 to 2015 the rate of use of
 
03:58:14.389 --> 03:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
Corrections placements for children went
 
03:58:16.790 --> 03:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
down by
 
03:58:19.910 --> 03:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
53% now part of that was a deliberate
 
03:58:22.590 --> 03:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
change in policy in many states just
 
03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire has decided that it's
 
03:58:26.830 --> 03:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
better and more cost effective to reduce
 
03:58:28.429 --> 03:58:28.439 align:start position:0%
the use of facilities like the sununu
 
03:58:31.070 --> 03:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
center but it also it is also because
 
03:58:33.110 --> 03:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's been a significant reduction in
 
03:58:34.990 --> 03:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
demand on the juvenile just justice
 
03:58:36.710 --> 03:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
system as a whole because the juvenile
 
03:58:38.189 --> 03:58:38.199 align:start position:0%
crime rate just like the adult crime
 
03:58:41.750 --> 03:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
rate has been in Decline since the 1990s
 
03:58:44.429 --> 03:58:44.439 align:start position:0%
the arrest nationally of children went
 
03:58:48.710 --> 03:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
down by 50% from 2006 to 2019 I don't
 
03:58:50.189 --> 03:58:50.199 align:start position:0%
have an exact statistic for New
 
03:58:53.189 --> 03:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it's I've certainly seen
 
03:58:54.510 --> 03:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
statistics in New Hampshire that show
 
03:58:56.790 --> 03:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
we've had a significant decline in the
 
03:58:58.670 --> 03:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
number of delinquency petitions that are
 
03:59:00.389 --> 03:59:00.399 align:start position:0%
brought and the number of cases that
 
03:59:01.670 --> 03:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
have been brought into court over that
 
03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
same period of time so I'd ask you for
 
03:59:05.149 --> 03:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
your support of the bill as amended I
 
03:59:07.870 --> 03:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
think the amendment is very key to uh
 
03:59:12.149 --> 03:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
making this bill work um successfully um
 
03:59:14.590 --> 03:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
it will be um better for kids
 
03:59:16.389 --> 03:59:16.399 align:start position:0%
um and a more effective use of scarce
 
03:59:18.110 --> 03:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
public resources be happy to answer any
 
03:59:20.469 --> 03:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:23.149 --> 03:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Skiby do we have
 
03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr
 
03:59:30.590 --> 03:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
Skiby seeing none um I thank you very
 
03:59:33.990 --> 03:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
much for your time and information and
 
03:59:36.510 --> 03:59:36.520 align:start position:0%

the next person we'll speak with will be

03:59:49.309 --> 03:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
right great thank you um for the record
 
03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
my name is Rebecca Ross I'm general
 
03:59:57.389 --> 03:59:57.399 align:start position:0%
counsel and legislative gazon for
 
03:59:59.830 --> 03:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
DCF um we are not taking a position on
 
04:00:01.309 --> 04:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
this bill but we did want to provide
 
04:00:04.510 --> 04:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
some some background information um in
 
04:00:06.389 --> 04:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
advance of the hearing I provided a
 
04:00:09.469 --> 04:00:09.479 align:start position:0%
number of documents via email to the
 
04:00:11.149 --> 04:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
committee's researcher I hope you have
 
04:00:14.269 --> 04:00:14.279 align:start position:0%
those or we'll have them shortly
 
04:00:17.189 --> 04:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
um we also have Erica angelli from
 
04:00:19.510 --> 04:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health on the
 
04:00:21.510 --> 04:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
hearing today who can answer questions
 
04:00:23.110 --> 04:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
related to behavioral health to the
 
04:00:27.349 --> 04:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
extent those arise as well um to start
 
04:00:31.149 --> 04:00:31.159 align:start position:0%
with we just wanted to provide some some
 
04:00:33.590 --> 04:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
background and two of the documents I
 
04:00:37.429 --> 04:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
provided were from dcf's data book um
 
04:00:42.110 --> 04:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
both page 8 and Page 20 Page 20 looks at
 
04:00:44.149 --> 04:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
the use of sununu Center and as you look
 
04:00:45.790 --> 04:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
at that it will reflect exactly what you
 
04:00:48.990 --> 04:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
heard the other um folks testify today
 
04:00:52.750 --> 04:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
that the use of syse has decreased
 
04:00:56.710 --> 04:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
dramatically since 2016 through fiscal
 
04:00:58.990 --> 04:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
year 2020 which is reflected in there
 
04:01:02.110 --> 04:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
last year the average daily census was
 
04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
16.9 and in the last few months we've
 
04:01:09.710 --> 04:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
seen slightly lower numbers as well um
 
04:01:12.830 --> 04:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
so we want to make sure that as we're
 
04:01:15.750 --> 04:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
making further changes to who can be
 
04:01:18.750 --> 04:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
committed that we avoid any unintended
 
04:01:20.870 --> 04:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
consequences and understand where we're
 
04:01:23.229 --> 04:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
starting from if we're going to continue
 
04:01:27.590 --> 04:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
to make shifts um a couple additional
 
04:01:29.750 --> 04:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
facts from the data book that I think
 
04:01:33.670 --> 04:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
are relevant are that um last year there
 
04:01:36.910 --> 04:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
were about 1,700 delinquency cases of
 
04:01:38.550 --> 04:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
those delinquency
 
04:01:43.110 --> 04:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
cases less than 400 were in placement of
 
04:01:46.030 --> 04:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
that number in replacement a much
 
04:01:49.510 --> 04:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
smaller portion were committed to syc so
 
04:01:51.429 --> 04:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about a very
 
04:01:54.870 --> 04:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
very small number of cases and folks and
 
04:01:56.550 --> 04:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
the question is where should that line
 
04:02:00.630 --> 04:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
be drawn on who who can get in I think
 
04:02:02.990 --> 04:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
that the offenses that are listed are
 
04:02:06.110 --> 04:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely appropriate murder attempted
 
04:02:06.120 --> 04:02:07.910 align:start position:0%
absolutely appropriate murder attempted
murder

04:02:07.910 --> 04:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
murder
 
04:02:12.309 --> 04:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
um aggravated fonus sexual
 
04:02:14.710 --> 04:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
assault no question those have already
 
04:02:17.110 --> 04:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
been identified as the serious violent
 
04:02:20.750 --> 04:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
offenses um and we heard testimony about
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
Minor offenses but the question for you
 
04:02:23.279 --> 04:02:24.590 align:start position:0%
Minor offenses but the question for you
really

04:02:24.590 --> 04:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:02:27.710 --> 04:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
is what's in between and how should
 
04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
those be treated because um the most
 
04:02:32.399 --> 04:02:33.389 align:start position:0%
those be treated because um the most
serious

04:02:33.389 --> 04:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
serious
 
04:02:36.630 --> 04:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
offenses are identified the minor
 
04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
offenses already are not coming in the
 
04:02:40.110 --> 04:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
door to
 
04:02:44.750 --> 04:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
syc but have we drawn that line in this
 
04:02:46.670 --> 04:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
bill so
 
04:02:50.110 --> 04:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
narrowly that we are going to be um
 
04:02:52.309 --> 04:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
removing the safety net in cases that we
 
04:02:56.189 --> 04:02:56.199 align:start position:0%
need it so an additional document that I
 
04:02:58.269 --> 04:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
provided you with and I don't know if
 
04:02:59.590 --> 04:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
all of the members of the committee are
 
04:03:01.750 --> 04:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
familiar with this or not but it's the
 
04:03:04.269 --> 04:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
Court's detention screening instrument
 
04:03:07.389 --> 04:03:07.399 align:start position:0%
that is used every time the court is
 
04:03:10.830 --> 04:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
asked to issue a detention order and
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
attached to the instructions which are
 
04:03:15.189 --> 04:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
also provided is a list of all of the
 
04:03:17.429 --> 04:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
offenses and how they rank and how they
 
04:03:20.309 --> 04:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
are considered and a thoughtful group of
 
04:03:22.349 --> 04:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
folks including defense attorneys went
 
04:03:26.670 --> 04:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
through and amended that effective July
 
04:03:29.910 --> 04:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
2019 to really rank the risk level
 
04:03:31.630 --> 04:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
associated with different offenses and
 
04:03:33.269 --> 04:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
you'll see on that list that there are a
 
04:03:35.229 --> 04:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
number of tier 2
 
04:03:41.189 --> 04:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
offenses um that are um certainly very
 
04:03:43.349 --> 04:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
intimate offenses personal offenses
 
04:03:45.149 --> 04:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
against other individuals that are not
 
04:03:47.710 --> 04:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
included on the list for which um
 
04:03:51.309 --> 04:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
commitment is contemplated in this bill
 
04:03:54.309 --> 04:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
now this Bild as representative rice
 
04:03:57.670 --> 04:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
said it's to encourage treatment in the
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
community and all youth who are within
 
04:04:01.750 --> 04:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
the delinquency system or
 
04:04:04.030 --> 04:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely have the ability to Avail
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
themselves of treatment in the community
 
04:04:09.229 --> 04:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
what this is really looking at is who
 
04:04:11.830 --> 04:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
can we treat in a secure facility when
 
04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely necessary
 
04:04:16.790 --> 04:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
and so the another document that I
 
04:04:19.710 --> 04:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
provided is a list of the statutory
 
04:04:22.469 --> 04:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
Provisions related to some of those tier
 
04:04:24.870 --> 04:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
2 felony offenses in the description of
 
04:04:27.149 --> 04:04:27.159 align:start position:0%
what they are for example we have a
 
04:04:30.349 --> 04:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
number of Youth at syc that are there
 
04:04:32.710 --> 04:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
for simple assault and if you look at
 
04:04:34.830 --> 04:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
our definition of simple assault it does
 
04:04:38.429 --> 04:04:38.439 align:start position:0%
include bodily injury and there are kids
 
04:04:40.510 --> 04:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
who are not eligible to be in any other
 
04:04:42.030 --> 04:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
residential program because they will
 
04:04:44.149 --> 04:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
not accept them because of their AG Rive
 
04:04:46.630 --> 04:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
Behavior now whether or not simple
 
04:04:49.070 --> 04:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
assault fits into the list of Minor
 
04:04:50.830 --> 04:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
offenders I think you have to look at
 
04:04:52.870 --> 04:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
the facts and circumstances of that and
 
04:04:57.149 --> 04:04:57.159 align:start position:0%
to remove that ability from the judge um
 
04:04:58.950 --> 04:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
for that small number of Youth that
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about should be carefully
 
04:05:03.550 --> 04:05:03.560 align:start position:0%
considered so I would ask you to
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
consider that list looking specifically
 
04:05:08.429 --> 04:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
at things like human trafficking
 
04:05:11.510 --> 04:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
offenses against minors under 13
 
04:05:13.429 --> 04:05:13.439 align:start position:0%
domestic violence is not included in
 
04:05:16.269 --> 04:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
that list resisting arrest and causing
 
04:05:18.309 --> 04:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
bodily injury to an officer is not
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
included in that list there are a number
 
04:05:23.030 --> 04:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
of things that if we're removing from
 
04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
that list we need to
 
04:05:28.590 --> 04:05:28.600 align:start position:0%
consider what the outcome of that would
 
04:05:33.070 --> 04:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
be um looking at the purpose of 169c the
 
04:05:36.309 --> 04:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
delinquency um statute it includes
 
04:05:38.750 --> 04:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
providing protection care treatment
 
04:05:40.830 --> 04:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
counseling supervision and
 
04:05:43.830 --> 04:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative resources
 
04:05:45.229 --> 04:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
the department is absolutely committed
 
04:05:48.189 --> 04:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
to buiing those in the least restrictive
 
04:05:50.110 --> 04:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
most appropriate environment we just
 
04:05:51.189 --> 04:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we are not
 
04:05:53.670 --> 04:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
narrowing the system too much that we
 
04:05:57.750 --> 04:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
don't Avail ourselves at to the most
 
04:05:59.830 --> 04:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate setting for some of these
 
04:06:03.070 --> 04:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
youth so in considering the unintended
 
04:06:06.750 --> 04:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
consequences of this bill if we are
 
04:06:08.830 --> 04:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
looking at not allowing commitment for
 
04:06:11.910 --> 04:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
some of these offenses that are not
 
04:06:14.710 --> 04:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
included um
 
04:06:19.550 --> 04:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
we risk having um youth that cannot be
 
04:06:22.189 --> 04:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
placed anywhere because their aggressive
 
04:06:24.269 --> 04:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
behaviors prevent them from being placed
 
04:06:27.070 --> 04:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
in other residential facilities again
 
04:06:28.670 --> 04:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a very small number
 
04:06:32.750 --> 04:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
of people but we do think those folks
 
04:06:36.309 --> 04:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
exist um as well
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
as how will the rest of the system
 
04:06:42.910 --> 04:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
respond and we would be concerned that
 
04:06:42.920 --> 04:06:44.670 align:start position:0%
respond and we would be concerned that
if

04:06:44.670 --> 04:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:06:46.590 --> 04:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
prosecutors in the criminal justice
 
04:06:50.030 --> 04:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
system believe that um the delinquency
 
04:06:51.790 --> 04:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
system is not responding we will
 
04:06:53.950 --> 04:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
actually see an increase in the number
 
04:06:56.710 --> 04:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
of petitions to certify 16 and 17 year
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
olds as adults and move them prematurely
 
04:07:02.349 --> 04:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
into the adult system because the
 
04:07:04.710 --> 04:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
juvenile system is not responsive enough
 
04:07:08.070 --> 04:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
and we would have concerns about not
 
04:07:09.309 --> 04:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
04:07:12.429 --> 04:07:12.439 align:start position:0%
provide a rehabilitative system through
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
delinquency and forcing kids at an
 
04:07:16.710 --> 04:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
earlier age into a more punitive adult
 
04:07:18.790 --> 04:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
system where they would actually be
 
04:07:21.189 --> 04:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
detained at syu for a longer period of
 
04:07:22.510 --> 04:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
time pending
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
certification um and potentially face
 
04:07:27.950 --> 04:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
transitioning to the adult correction
 
04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
system when they age out um and if we
 
04:07:33.510 --> 04:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
narrow the system too much we risk
 
04:07:36.550 --> 04:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
seeing that uh we also are concerned
 
04:07:39.309 --> 04:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
that we decrease the ability to reach
 
04:07:41.269 --> 04:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
settlements in some of these cases where
 
04:07:43.630 --> 04:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
we see second deegree assaults or
 
04:07:46.870 --> 04:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
aggravated fonus sexual assault pled
 
04:07:49.070 --> 04:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
down to simple assault knowing that the
 
04:07:50.149 --> 04:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
individual will be able to get the
 
04:07:51.630 --> 04:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
treatment they need in a secured
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
facility and um considering victims in
 
04:07:57.830 --> 04:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
the community if that is no longer an
 
04:08:00.229 --> 04:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
option are we going to see a reluctance
 
04:08:02.830 --> 04:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
to um enter into agreements and actually
 
04:08:04.830 --> 04:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
be pushing toward a more punitive or
 
04:08:06.990 --> 04:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
higher level offense which I think would
 
04:08:09.469 --> 04:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
be an unintended unintended consequence
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill um so in addition to those
 
04:08:15.269 --> 04:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
concerns about what will happen to that
 
04:08:17.670 --> 04:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
small number of kids in between that may
 
04:08:19.750 --> 04:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
not be minor offenders but aren't on the
 
04:08:22.149 --> 04:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
list contemplated in the bill as
 
04:08:25.109 --> 04:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
proposed um as well as the timing we
 
04:08:26.630 --> 04:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
just ask for you to thoughtfully
 
04:08:28.189 --> 04:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
consider if this is where the line needs
 
04:08:30.590 --> 04:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
to be drawn at this time I'm happy to
 
04:08:36.109 --> 04:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:36.119 --> 04:08:37.830 align:start position:0%
 
questions

04:08:37.830 --> 04:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:08:41.189 --> 04:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank any questions from Miss
 
04:08:44.710 --> 04:08:44.720 align:start position:0%

thank you madam Vice chair

um to Miss Ross this is representative
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:59.870 --> 04:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
overridden um I don't have that in front
 
04:09:01.590 --> 04:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
of me I we could reach out to the courts
 
04:09:03.429 --> 04:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
to ask for that information they track
 
04:09:06.910 --> 04:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
all of the the um screen
 
04:09:09.830 --> 04:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
instruments okay thank
 
04:09:13.070 --> 04:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Lui uh thank you
 
04:09:17.870 --> 04:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
madam shair um my question is if we are
 
04:09:20.030 --> 04:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
going to take people out of tuno I've
 
04:09:21.189 --> 04:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
been doing a lot about the use of
 
04:09:24.229 --> 04:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
restraints in other facilities and might
 
04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
be putting kids into a situation where
 
04:09:29.189 --> 04:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
another facility blessing facility would
 
04:09:33.790 --> 04:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:35.790 --> 04:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
restrain I think that's one of the
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
concerns that that
 
04:09:40.710 --> 04:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
facilities have to assess their risk and
 
04:09:42.710 --> 04:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
the ability to keep kids safe and one of
 
04:09:45.670 --> 04:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
the reasons why they may not accept a
 
04:09:47.670 --> 04:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
youth is because they don't feel like
 
04:09:51.750 --> 04:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
they have the tools to keep them safe um
 
04:09:54.750 --> 04:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
and don't want to be in violation of the
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion laws and don't
 
04:09:59.830 --> 04:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
have the ability to have a um
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:09.229 --> 04:10:09.239 align:start position:0%

several years we've managed a policy
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
agenda with a very specific uh focus on
 
04:11:06.630 --> 04:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health uh in this
 
04:11:08.670 --> 04:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
role we have also participated as a
 
04:11:10.710 --> 04:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
member of the juvenile reform project
 
04:11:12.429 --> 04:11:12.439 align:start position:0%
which has been mentioned by some of the
 
04:11:13.870 --> 04:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
previous speakers
 
04:11:15.510 --> 04:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
and we too support the bill with the
 
04:11:18.189 --> 04:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
amendment previously described uh the
 
04:11:20.229 --> 04:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
previous speakers Did a a great job of
 
04:11:22.950 --> 04:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
outlining exactly why this is important
 
04:11:24.630 --> 04:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
um the only thing that I will add is
 
04:11:26.630 --> 04:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
that as the department works towards
 
04:11:29.070 --> 04:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
full implementation of the reforms in
 
04:11:31.349 --> 04:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 14 which are the reforms
 
04:11:34.510 --> 04:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
around the children's system of care um
 
04:11:35.910 --> 04:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
we believe that the array of Community
 
04:11:37.750 --> 04:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
Based Services available to support
 
04:11:39.790 --> 04:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
these children who are multi-stem
 
04:11:42.109 --> 04:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
involved and require significant mental
 
04:11:44.830 --> 04:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
health supports will be available um and
 
04:11:46.670 --> 04:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
again as the other speakers have said we
 
04:11:48.429 --> 04:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
strongly believe that connecting these
 
04:11:50.229 --> 04:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
children to clinically appropriate
 
04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
Community Based Services is a more
 
04:11:53.870 --> 04:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
Humane and a better alternative to
 
04:11:56.269 --> 04:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
incarceration for many of them and we
 
04:11:57.510 --> 04:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
know the outcomes are better when
 
04:11:59.710 --> 04:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
children can remain in their communities
 
04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
um and it's better for their long-term
 
04:12:03.710 --> 04:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
Health as well so I'll yield the rest of
 
04:12:05.149 --> 04:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
my time I think the other speakers have
 
04:12:06.750 --> 04:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
covered it well but I'm happy to answer
 
04:12:08.990 --> 04:12:09.000 align:start position:0%

04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%

everybody it's not morning uh Erica
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
gelli I am the director for the Bureau
 
04:13:21.630 --> 04:13:21.640 align:start position:0%
for children's Behavioral Health at the
 
04:13:23.389 --> 04:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human
 
04:13:26.349 --> 04:13:26.359 align:start position:0%
Services um I just wanted to add a
 
04:13:28.429 --> 04:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
little uh additional information from
 
04:13:33.229 --> 04:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
what Rebecca Ross had said um I reviewed
 
04:13:36.990 --> 04:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
the uh bill I have not yet seen the
 
04:13:40.389 --> 04:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
amendment um uh from the description of
 
04:13:42.750 --> 04:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment it sounds as though one of
 
04:13:44.950 --> 04:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
the requirements around the Care
 
04:13:49.790 --> 04:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
Management entity has been uh taken out
 
04:13:53.349 --> 04:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case that's fine we do
 
04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
um through the Care Management entity
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
accept any children referrals for
 
04:13:59.870 --> 04:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
children who require that intensive
 
04:14:02.990 --> 04:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
level communitybased support um that
 
04:14:05.229 --> 04:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
would include that does include any
 
04:14:07.189 --> 04:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
child in involved in the Juvenile
 
04:14:12.189 --> 04:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
Justice System um already so uh we don't
 
04:14:14.750 --> 04:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily need a requirement around
 
04:14:18.349 --> 04:14:18.359 align:start position:0%
that um and I just wanted to reiterate
 
04:14:20.229 --> 04:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that Rebecca Ross
 
04:14:24.429 --> 04:14:24.439 align:start position:0%
had stated around the
 
04:14:28.990 --> 04:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
um one or two instances where we've had
 
04:14:33.389 --> 04:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
uh children with very intensive needs
 
04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
and have had some real aggression issues
 
04:14:42.030 --> 04:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
um become sort of uh either stuck at an
 
04:14:44.750 --> 04:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
emergency department or at a psychiatric
 
04:14:48.109 --> 04:14:48.119 align:start position:0%
hospital um for longer periods of time
 
04:14:50.990 --> 04:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
than uh we anybody would want them to be
 
04:14:55.269 --> 04:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
there um and trying to find the next
 
04:14:59.309 --> 04:14:59.319 align:start position:0%
best treatment um option for them um so
 
04:15:02.030 --> 04:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's just a little uh information that
 
04:15:04.870 --> 04:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
we have seen happen in the system today
 
04:15:07.269 --> 04:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
we are working really hard on all of
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
those uh requirements within s sp14 and
 
04:15:13.830 --> 04:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
to broaden the bench of Behavioral
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
Health supports for all children who
 
04:15:18.670 --> 04:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
require them in New Hampshire um a lot
 
04:15:22.229 --> 04:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
of those uh areas will be implemented
 
04:15:25.590 --> 04:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
very soon and that will help for sure
 
04:15:28.269 --> 04:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
but again as Rebecca Ross had stated
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
there are going to be those one or two
 
04:15:34.149 --> 04:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh couple of uh children that we've seen
 
04:15:37.109 --> 04:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
come through that really requires uh
 
04:15:39.269 --> 04:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
something more intense a little more
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
secure than what we have today and what
 
04:15:45.189 --> 04:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
we still may not have in the future once
 
04:15:47.510 --> 04:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
we've implemented all of our
 
04:15:51.910 --> 04:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
requirements and um so that's just uh an
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
example we have seen uh to date and
 
04:16:00.790 --> 04:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
we'll likely see again um in the future
 
04:16:04.349 --> 04:16:04.359 align:start position:0%
uh at any given time
 
04:16:09.149 --> 04:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:12.469 --> 04:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I do see one
 
04:16:12.479 --> 04:16:16.510 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I do see one
question

04:16:16.510 --> 04:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:22.349 --> 04:16:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:25.830 --> 04:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
un hi thank you for um taking my
 
04:16:30.269 --> 04:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
question Madame Vice chair um related to
 
04:16:33.630 --> 04:16:33.640 align:start position:0%
those situations where people are left
 
04:16:36.309 --> 04:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
in the emergency rooms for long periods
 
04:16:42.030 --> 04:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
of time um are there any solutions for
 
04:16:46.750 --> 04:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
that population right now in the works
 
04:16:46.760 --> 04:16:48.550 align:start position:0%
that population right now in the works
and

04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:16:51.590 --> 04:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely we have a number of
 
04:16:55.109 --> 04:16:55.119 align:start position:0%
different interventions that we are um
 
04:16:57.830 --> 04:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
currently working on implementing and I
 
04:17:00.510 --> 04:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
I'll am happy to go through the list
 
04:17:05.109 --> 04:17:05.119 align:start position:0%
um we I'm happy to report that under
 
04:17:07.950 --> 04:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
usual circumstances this is not happen a
 
04:17:11.830 --> 04:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
lot for children in New Hampshire um
 
04:17:14.790 --> 04:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the rise of numbers of kids
 
04:17:17.389 --> 04:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
at emergency departments I think because
 
04:17:21.109 --> 04:17:21.119 align:start position:0%
of covid um so the numbers are higher
 
04:17:23.710 --> 04:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
now than what we're used to so under
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
normal circumstances we don't run into
 
04:17:29.910 --> 04:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
these uh situations where children are
 
04:17:32.429 --> 04:17:32.439 align:start position:0%
at um emergency departments for long
 
04:17:34.870 --> 04:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
periods of time that's the good news um
 
04:17:37.830 --> 04:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
what we are doing uh to address those
 
04:17:41.109 --> 04:17:41.119 align:start position:0%
issues are the first thing is we are
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
working to implement and very close
 
04:17:44.790 --> 04:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
close to implementing stage one of
 
04:17:47.630 --> 04:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
Statewide mobile crisis for children so
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
that with the hopes that children and
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
adults alike will not have to go to the
 
04:17:56.870 --> 04:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
emergeny departments in the first place
 
04:17:58.790 --> 04:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
to address their Behavioral Health
 
04:18:02.469 --> 04:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
crisis um secondly there we have
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
expanded greatly the our intensive
 
04:18:08.389 --> 04:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
Community Based programming that is uh
 
04:18:10.590 --> 04:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
implemented by our Care Management
 
04:18:12.910 --> 04:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
entities of which we have two in the
 
04:18:15.429 --> 04:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
State um so our numbers in that
 
04:18:17.710 --> 04:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
intensive Community Based programming
 
04:18:23.229 --> 04:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
has risen from 100 well up over 200 uh
 
04:18:25.149 --> 04:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
children being served in those that
 
04:18:26.990 --> 04:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
program right now and that's the program
 
04:18:29.149 --> 04:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
that we refer to as fast
 
04:18:32.790 --> 04:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
forward we also are including another
 
04:18:35.429 --> 04:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
program uh in the book of business of
 
04:18:37.790 --> 04:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
the Care Management entities to follow
 
04:18:40.710 --> 04:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
children in residential treatment to be
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
able to um help transition appropriately
 
04:18:48.429 --> 04:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
back to their home Community um we are
 
04:18:51.309 --> 04:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
also uh going through a complete
 
04:18:53.670 --> 04:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment transformation
 
04:18:56.590 --> 04:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
work this is uh spurred on by a number
 
04:18:58.149 --> 04:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
of different things one being the
 
04:19:00.510 --> 04:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
federal uh fames first legislation that
 
04:19:03.309 --> 04:19:03.319 align:start position:0%
you heard a little bit about today um
 
04:19:05.590 --> 04:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
the 10-year Mental Health Plan and the
 
04:19:08.590 --> 04:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
Child Welfare uh transformation
 
04:19:13.750 --> 04:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations all uh aligned to um
 
04:19:17.070 --> 04:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
give us the impetus to redo the entire
 
04:19:18.990 --> 04:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
residential treatment system in New
 
04:19:21.510 --> 04:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where we will have five
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
different levels of care that will
 
04:19:27.710 --> 04:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully meet most if not all of the
 
04:19:29.830 --> 04:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
needs of the children in New Hampshire
 
04:19:31.750 --> 04:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
so we don't have children going out of
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
state we don't have children lingering
 
04:19:37.550 --> 04:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:41.389 --> 04:19:41.399 align:start position:0%

okay so have a great night drive safe
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
bye bye hey I wanted to yeah I I wanted
 
04:22:37.950 --> 04:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
to ask on uh so I see we have a
 
04:22:42.830 --> 04:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
Wednesday on the 2nd I believe yes um so
 
04:22:44.870 --> 04:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
so do we know if there's going to be a
 
04:22:48.389 --> 04:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
day or two days that we could block out
 
04:22:51.149 --> 04:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
well we're working on that right now um
 
04:22:53.189 --> 04:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
the problem we're running into is there
 
04:22:55.070 --> 04:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
are some committees that need two or
 
04:22:56.710 --> 04:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
three days because they have so many
 
04:22:56.720 --> 04:22:57.790 align:start position:0%
three days because they have so many
early

04:22:57.790 --> 04:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
early
 
04:23:00.750 --> 04:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
bills so for the next few weeks we're
 
04:23:03.469 --> 04:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
not going to really have a a blocked day
 
04:23:06.630 --> 04:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
I am trying for Thursdays it just turned
 
04:23:09.389 --> 04:23:09.399 align:start position:0%
out that originally we weren't going to
 
04:23:12.510 --> 04:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
meet next week because they they needed
 
04:23:14.790 --> 04:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
all the days for the um committees that
 
04:23:17.830 --> 04:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
have early bills but because they ended
 
04:23:20.830 --> 04:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
up having that one day they offered it I
 
04:23:23.109 --> 04:23:23.119 align:start position:0%
took it because I don't want us to get
 
04:23:24.870 --> 04:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know really far behind and feel
 
04:23:28.710 --> 04:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
rushed in our work so um I did that but
 
04:23:31.790 --> 04:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
I I am going to try for Thursdays but
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
right now everything is just such a work
 
04:23:37.590 --> 04:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
in progress that you know we're
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
trying so and another question are we
 
04:23:42.469 --> 04:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
still sticking to if you're a co-pa
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
answer you can't ask
 
04:23:46.630 --> 04:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
questions because I asked a question and
 
04:23:48.830 --> 04:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'm a co- so I should have done so we're
 
04:23:50.750 --> 04:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
gonna we're gonna stick with that we are
 
04:23:52.750 --> 04:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
but you know I mean listen it was our
 
04:23:55.630 --> 04:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
first day and I think we all did pretty
 
04:23:58.910 --> 04:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
good yeah it was done well thank you you
 
04:24:03.269 --> 04:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
know um I think that you know we things
 
04:24:05.269 --> 04:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
are going to happen but we'll do our
 
04:24:08.990 --> 04:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
best to you know stay on top of it all
 
04:24:11.229 --> 04:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's so hard with us in separate
 
04:24:12.870 --> 04:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
places and over the computer computer
 
04:24:16.349 --> 04:24:16.359 align:start position:0%
and everything but hopefully hopefully
 
04:24:19.550 --> 04:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
we're we're on the other side of this
 
04:24:21.630 --> 04:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic and and you know now that we
 
04:24:23.830 --> 04:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
have the vaccine and everything will be
 
04:24:26.750 --> 04:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
start getting better for us and we'll be
 
04:24:28.950 --> 04:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
able to breathe again with no masks
 
04:24:32.349 --> 04:24:32.359 align:start position:0%

04:24:35.070 --> 04:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
