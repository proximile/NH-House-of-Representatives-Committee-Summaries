00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire prescription drug
 
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
affordability board this morning um I
 
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
know that Mr White has other obligations

going to I'm going to
 
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
Mr Williamson I'm I'm going to try to
 
00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 align:start position:0%
frontload the kind of technical
 
00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 align:start position:0%
questions we may have after you do your
 
00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
presentation um so that um um Mr White
 
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
feels free to leave okay all right so um
 
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
with that would would you introduce
 
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
yourself to the committee and for the
 
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
clerk to put you in the record
 
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely um good morning everybody I'm
 
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
Kirk Williamson and I am the executive
 
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
director of the prescription drug
 
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
affordability board
 
00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
oh go ahead and uh Nathan white Chief
 
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer with the Department of
 
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services okay so uh I
 
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
think everything on the prescription
 
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
drug affordability board is on page
 
00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 align:start position:0%
1054 of the of the um the budget and the
 
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh request is 100% General funds uh in
 
00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 align:start position:0%
the next fiscal year it's essentially
 
00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know 256
 
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
5 um um th000 and then it goes up
 
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
slightly in the second year another
 
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
2656 so um so that's that but uh so my
 
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
my technical question is that in the
 
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.149 align:start position:0%
my technical question is that in the
last

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
hb2 uh I think I don't I think directed
 
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 align:start position:0%
may be the right term we the the the we
 
00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
directed that and account would be
 
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
established with the
 
00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 align:start position:0%
pdab so that it was able to receive uh
 
00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 align:start position:0%
Community donations to support its
 
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
operation and as I look at the the
 
00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
budget on
 
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
1054 I I do not see a line item where
 
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
you're ready to accept donations could
 
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
could you could you speak to
 
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.949 align:start position:0%
could you could you speak to
that

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
sure so um chairman Edwards is is
 
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
referring to the the dedicated fund that
 
00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
was created in
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
statute and the the prescription drug
 
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
affordability board accouny unit 6273
 
00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 align:start position:0%
that is 100% General funds from a
 
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
funding source perspective there are no
 
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 align:start position:0%
other funds there
 
00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 align:start position:0%
currently um I don't I if you want to so
 
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
so to just clarify that uh if if that
 
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
that means the dedicated fund is not yet
 
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
established because if it were it would
 
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
be a line item here or would it be a
 
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
else class I think you call it a class
 
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
code 6273 would it fall under there so
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
the thing that I would just need to go
 
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
back and verify and take a closer look
 
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
at the statute is whether the accounting
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
unit that's sitting before you would be
 
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
considered part of that dedicated fund I
 
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
suspect that that would potentially be
 
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
different but if the intent was for the
 
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
other Revenue sources to fund the
 
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
operations then we would see those other
 
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources here and we may just
 
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
want to take a closer look at the
 
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.070 align:start position:0%
want to take a closer look at the
original

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
statutory uh language on that front all
 
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
right so so the intent of that uh uh in
 
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
hp2 last year was to establish a form of
 
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
other Revenue to associate with a
 
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board so
 
00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
that any Don ations received could be
 
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
used directly by uh the operations that
 
00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
that that was the intent and I'm glad
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
you're going to relook the statute
 
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
because that but uh because because I
 
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
don't remember the statute but I did I
 
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
clearly remember the
 
00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
intent absolutely and we we haven't been
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
approached with donations as of yet or
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
or that type of we haven't been
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
approached with any Revenue um the
 
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
original uh legislation did have us
 
00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
funded through peas and assessments um
 
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
um like many other boards in the state
 
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
that shifted to 100% General funds and
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
we do have ideas that we'd like to talk
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
with you about chairman Edwards um that
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
we've been thinking about to be more
 
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
self- sustaining yeah um and it could be
 
00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
an hb2 thing but yeah maybe we could
 
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
talk offline about that so so we can do
 
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
all of that I the my my goal here was
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
just to do the technical part of the
 
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
conversation so that Mr White could feel
 
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
free to to to go do the conflicting
 
00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.110 align:start position:0%
free to to to go do the conflicting
things

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
and then we'll talk we'll
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
yeah uh represent I respect the the need
 
00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
for Mr White to leave but I'm wondering
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
if the executive director can literally
 
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
give us a 45 second summary of what PAB
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
is for the members that were not part of
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
us last B I'm here to have that
 
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
conversation and knowledge we we we'll
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
have that I Mr White are you do you are
 
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
you preparing to say anything
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
further yes
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm looking at the statute it's
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
it's under RSA 126
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
bb8 and it establishes the non-aps
 
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
fund um and it it it does it does
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
specify that the the board shall use the
 
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
the dollars consistent with the
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
provisions of of the statute but
 
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
um may be used to pay for administrative
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
technical legal support and other costs
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
incurred by the board so it's not
 
00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:30.759 align:start position:0%
necessarily clear to me that the intent
 
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
there was to um supplant or replace the
 
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
accounting unit that you're seeing
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
within the governor's operating budget
 
00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:41.629 align:start position:0%
within the governor's operating budget
in

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
6273 yeah the intent was to augment to
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
be a supplemental source so that we
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
we're not 100% relying on General funds
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
but that we could um that that without
 
00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
us directing the spending of that of
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
those receipts that that would create
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
flexibility for for uh the board yep and
 
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
and so if uh as as Kirk was indicating
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
if if we were to receive any Revenue
 
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:10.120 align:start position:0%
then what we would do is we would go
 
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
through the standard process uh as
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
dictated by rsa1
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
1430a where we'd accept the dollars
 
00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:19.479 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal committee and GNC and
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
then we would sub submit a memo to D or
 
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
D would go ahead and add those funds to
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
that account and then those could be
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
utilized but currently because um we
 
00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:30.919 align:start position:0%
have no in that account you're not going
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
to see that show up here it's um it's
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
similar to I think a few other scenarios
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
where uh for R example from yesterday
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
with the uh maximum security unit where
 
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
because we don't have any history there
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
you're not actually seeing any account
 
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
show up because there's no revenue and
 
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
and to have an expense you need to have
 
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue right so okay so I I have been
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
thinking there we had a chicken and egg
 
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
situation that first we had to create
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
the account so that the uh board could
 
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
solicit uh or encourage donations that
 
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
that that it was a stepwise step one
 
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
establish the account to seek donations
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
but it's not that way it's actually the
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
opposite is what you're saying well
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
because because the account The
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
Authority for the account is already
 
00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:19.959 align:start position:0%
established in state law uh what we
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
would do is just submit a memo to this
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
is one of the things you don't really
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
see here but we submit memos to D you
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
know for certain things and this would
 
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
be one of those things that would just
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
transpire once we money right so so the
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
takeaway from that is we've always been
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
able to or since that statute went into
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
effect we've always been able to accept
 
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
donations uh and based on the first
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
donation I think I donated a dollar
 
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.310 align:start position:0%
donation I think I donated a dollar
actually

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't know where it went
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
but I I don't I did not accept that
 
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%
dollar you did not accept you offered me
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
one but I said I do not want to accept
 
00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
this because I don't want to spend that
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
much time I I'm going to have to spend a
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
lot more money to accept the dollar then
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to be worth what's your break
 
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
even how much do I have to give you to
 
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh have you establish the account uh I
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
don't know uh think about it okay uh O
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
Okay so I think we've hit that one topic
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
and if you would like to excuse yourself
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
no I no one here would be offended I I I
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
I greatly appreciate that sorry good
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%

residents businesses and taxpayers from
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
The High Cost of prescription drugs I
 
00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
know this is a very challenging area of
 
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
healthcare and just the issue RIT large
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
so if um if you have follow-up questions
 
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%

00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
just to level set with everybody the New
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire prescription drug
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
affordability board analyzes
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
prescription drug costs and their impact
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
on public payers taxpayers and patients
 
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
and identifies cost-saving opportunities
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
and makes public policy recommendations
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
to the legislature
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
the board monitors market trends
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
promotes transparency and vises the
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
legislature and public payers on
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
strategies to balance affordability with
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
sustainable healthc care spending in a
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
short amount of time we have already
 
00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
produced results um in our last report
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
we identified $6 million in potential
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
estimated savings if those negotiated
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
rates were applied to New Hampshire
 
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
Public state in local employee health
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
plans we would immediately see reduced
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
bending um we are formalizing a
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation for a state-backed
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
privacy first pharmacy savings card that
 
00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:03.399 align:start position:0%
would be no cost to the state um it
 
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
launched two years ago in Connecticut as
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
for one example they are seeing an
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
average of $240 of savings per script
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
that comes to $1.23 million in savings
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
for the state shows that in the slide
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
deck that the breakdown on that 6
 
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
million I included the I included it in
 
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
our accomplishments um but I can follow
 
00:12:25.949 --> 00:12:25.959 align:start position:0%
up with that information if that would
 
00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
be helpful for you yeah I think this is
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
a a kind of a critical issue because um
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh I I I think you all have been
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
operating uh in statute for about four
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
and a half years and uh and and there's
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
been a tremendous amount of startup
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
investment made and I think we're on
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
you're on I I should for disclosure let
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
people know I'm I'm a member of the
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board I
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
think I think the board is on the cusp
 
00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
of being able to produce things um and I
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
want to talk about the forward-looking
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
part of how we're investing to get a
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
return on investment so so the the idea
 
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
that we've already had a return uh I
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
think we need to understand
 
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
that sure um and so we were established
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
in 2002 I was hired last year so the
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
board has been staffed with one
 
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
full-time employee for for a little over
 
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
a year um and and to your point laying
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
the foundation does take a lot of work a
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
lot of investment there is rulle making
 
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
data sharing agreements getting the
 
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
analytical processes in place um we now
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
have those data sharing agreements in
 
00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
place we are analyzing and tracking
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
prescription drug spending over time we
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
are identifying areas of cost-saving
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities we are in the process of
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
formalizing a recommendation and working
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
with the governor on this prescription
 
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
drug discount card but we can only make
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations that be very clear we
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
don't have enforcement Authority we
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
can't do anything about the price
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
necessarily but we can make
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations and assist public payers
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
and assist the leg legislature to that
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
effect sure so just so you know what my
 
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
frame of mind is on this is that I I I
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
do agree that there's been a period of
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
time where we've had to ramp up and
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
create a capability and I don't actually
 
00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
I didn't actually expect uh that your
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
presentation would include any uh
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
specifics on um Financial benefits of
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
the past what I really was thinking we
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
would do today is talk prospectively on
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
how this new money in this budget would
 
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.350 align:start position:0%
how this new money in this budget would
be

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
leveraged for you know what we can
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
expect from it so so the fact that
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
you've got six million already right I
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
want to understand that because that's
 
00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
just kind of
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
extra and and I I want to ask let
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth ask his question
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
and and my question was very much in
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
line with I think where you're going um
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
and and we interrupted early on in the
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
presentation maybe you'll catch up with
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
this with the slides but what I'm
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
wondering is the Six Million as I
 
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
understand it it's a potential
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
savings and there is
 
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
a there's a path that will get that to
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
actual savings to the state and if I
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
could get an idea of what's missing
 
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
between here and then and how we get
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
there and I'd like to understand that so
 
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
I exactly what you're saying I want to
 
00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:42.519 align:start position:0%
turn the potential savings we have on
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
the table to what is that a couple years
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
from now in terms
 
00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:51.399 align:start position:0%
of savings that more than pays for what
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
we're doing to get them so so this is
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
just new information to me I don't know
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
how I missed her $6 million
 
00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:00.519 align:start position:0%
recommendation but but if if you if you
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh I before we end yeah I would like to
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
understand what the form of that
 
00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:08.629 align:start position:0%
understand what the form of that
recommendation

00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
was who received that recommendation and
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
what we think the perspectus is on those
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations being accepted and
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
converted into savings right right do
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
you want to do that now or do you want
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
to get into the rhythm of your
 
00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:27.079 align:start position:0%
presentation I can I can attempt to
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
answer it uh I can attempt to answer it
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
but then I I'll get back to the
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
presentation um We examined so part of
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
prescription drug pricing pbms negotiate
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
rebates um and and after the fact after
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
you do all the spending you get some
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
form of rebates back and it lowers your
 
00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
net cost or that produces your net price
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
rebates are very secretive they are
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
confidential they are privately
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
negotiated between manufacturers and
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
pbms we at the pdab don't have access to
 
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:56.839 align:start position:0%
those rebates nobody is sharing that
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
information with us but we are trying to
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
get there and we're trying to analyze
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
bending by looking at the net price okay
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
so we did an analysis that looked at
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
estimated estimated what our current
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
rebate capture is for just 10 drugs that
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
were negotiated by Medicare um these are
 
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
the first 10 drugs that Medica Medicare
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
because Medicare can now negotiate a
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
limited set of prescription drug prices
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
so so I'm and so I'm confused the focus
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
of the PAB is to save State payers money
 
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
you referring to a federal program I
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't I so I'm I'm I'm I'm confused by
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
the jump yeah so Medicare operates just
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
similarly to how we operate in at the
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
state level with commercial plans so
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
Part D is a commercially administered
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
plan it is subsidized by the federal
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
government but they also use pbms and so
 
00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
the secretary was uh barred from
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
negotiating up until last year and
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
starting with 10 drugs and so so now all
 
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
of those plans benefit because now they
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
have negotiated prices and those are
 
00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:06.039 align:start position:0%
known net prices we have no other
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
Benchmark to know if what we're paying
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
is more or higher than what we should be
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
paying and so when we looked at what
 
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
negotiated priced in Medicare get which
 
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
is now public and they are increasing
 
00:18:20.909 --> 00:18:20.919 align:start position:0%
the number of drugs over time we can
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
then say this is what we're missing out
 
00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
on by not leveraging those rates and so
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
this was in our first attempt we
 
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
identified 6 million just on those first
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
10 drugs that are some of the highest
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
cost drugs to the state plan to local
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
plans and yes that's that is a an
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
instructive Benchmark um and we're
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
hoping that over time as those savings
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
get larger we can hopefully have plan
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
sponsors come together and figure out a
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
way collectively that we could negotiate
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
those rates um it was contemplated at
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
the federal level that you know states
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
in the commercial Market would have
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
access to those negotiated rates but
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
that was not enacted unfortunately but
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
we have opportunities at the state level
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
to think creatively about how we could
 
00:19:04.149 --> 00:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
do that um and so that's where our
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
savings estimate came from so so to
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
summarize I think you're looking at the
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
example of Medicare seeing those 10
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
drugs seeing the the change in the
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
pricing you think we can take that uh
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
military term in Intel and convert it to
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
our Medicaid and other state purchasers
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
so that they have a road map to
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
achieving equivalent savings at the at
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
the state purchasing level yes all right
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
yes yeah and you know there there
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
international benchmarks you know we
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
could we could sit here and say well
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
Germany only pays $10 but we pay $300
 
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
but it's probably unreasonable that we
 
00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
would get 10 but this is a a closer
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
Benchmark to something that is real and
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
actual and and us-based and us-based
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
exactly so how do we communicate that to
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
the purchasers of New Hampshire drugs
 
00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:03.799 align:start position:0%
that that and that's Das I guess
 
00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
Corrections um you know other entities
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
within the state like uh you know Mr
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
Litman and Medicaid right and and
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Medicaid is a bit different
 
00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:16.919 align:start position:0%
they have a different but but how did
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
the board communicate it to the
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
purchasers so they know the board has
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
made a
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation well we we estimated the
 
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
savings we have not recommended
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
reference pricing that's not a
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the board has made
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
um but we are building the evidence and
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
distri and we are demonstrating what the
 
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
savings could be and we are
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
communicating it um by sending it to
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
them by alerting them to what we have
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
found uh we have an advisory Council
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
that we established last year um that
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
does consist of the the unions the
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
doj HHS Medicaid um the Department of
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
Corrections uh ccsnh the community
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
colleges and the university system so we
 
00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
do have feedback loops um we we only
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
established the advisory Council in
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
April in August um so many much of this
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
is being built as we're flying the plane
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
but um but that is how we have gone
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
about it thus far o okay so what I'm
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
thinking I'm hearing you say is that
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
you're using the Advisory Board to
 
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
communicate this potential savings and
 
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
you're doing it uh through formal
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
meetings of The Advisory Board that's
 
00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:30.039 align:start position:0%
one you you haven't you haven't
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
documented it in official letter from
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
board to send the letter to like Mr
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
Arling house and say right we have we
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
haven't done that step but you've been
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
talking through the advisory Council
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
right exactly and and and if we wanted
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to we could um I I like
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
that idea um I mean you're you're on the
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
board I I I also think that's a great
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
idea um but we we haven't done that yet
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
no okay all right are there any
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
questions at this point or
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
what okay thank you Mr chairman so um
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
your presentation is very well put
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
together and you're sort of going
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
through it through questioning so I just
 
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
want to make mention of the fact that
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
the advisory Council of which you are
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
referring right is on page 12 and the
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
members on page
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
13 of your very well put together
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
handout so everyone can get a good grip
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
on where that advisory council is found
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
in law their terms their meetings and
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
the membership so you're already on page
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
12 this is amazing thank you I am thank
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
you sir yeah I don't want to skip seven
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
though um oh is that I'm sorry I'm sorry
 
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
to interrupt can we have him even if
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
it's quickly he highlights the highlight
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
of each page as we flip through I feel
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
like we have done ourselves a dis
 
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
service here I I disagree uh I think
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
this is uh compatible with other
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
presentations where uh we've asked them
 
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
um questions as they've gone through the
 
00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
slide deck and uh we had one change uh
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
in that we needed to let Mr White leave
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
early I'm fine with that and you sorry I
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
didn't mean interrupt you
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
continue so I I think I think our
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
approach is consistent and I've been
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
trying to get back to to letting Mr
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
Williamson drive through his
 
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
presentation great and if I could make
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
the request that we may so you you mean
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
that sincerely that that's great that is
 
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
great because I would like does sound
 
00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:42.919 align:start position:0%
like you think it's great I'd like him
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
to continue through because I feel like
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
as my original request at the top of the
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
hour was to do a a quick highlevel
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
explanation for new members that I feel
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
we we just haven't even got but at this
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
point I think next term when you're the
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
all right um okay we're going to try to
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
let you get back through your
 
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
presentation but you've made some points
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to get clarified okay okay
 
00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:09.799 align:start position:0%
great and I think those clarifications
 
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
has strengthened your case awesome great
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um okay so so slide two going
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
back to slide two um this is the mission
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
goals and objectives of the board um we
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time last year developing
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
this um it was no small feat um but our
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
mission is to serve essential public
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
function by analyzing prescription drug
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
prices in New Hampshire and making
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations to public payers and the
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
legislature um and then you can see our
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
goals and our objectives um moving on to
 
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
slides three and four um you know Rising
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
prescription drug costs are a Statewide
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
issue that impacts the budget at every
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
level um so I need to ask you another
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
question though on page two the third
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
bullet protecting patient access to
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
essential prescription drugs to improve
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
is that is that directly related to uh
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 126 bb or is that an implied mission
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
that the board has adopted uh for
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
itself I I I just want to know the
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
distinction between what you're required
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
to do in law and what you you're
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
required to do because it makes
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
sense yeah yeah I I don't there's no
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
statute that says that right no but
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
there is one that talks about the
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations the second yeah that's
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
clearly in statute that we're supposed
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
to make CLE yes yeah yes sir and that's
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
why I was talking about that letter
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
because I think since that's in statute
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
we need a record of what recommendations
 
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
we're making so that that can be yeah
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
okay so so go ahead okay um okay so uh
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
Rising prescription drug caus a white
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
issue it affects public payers
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
businesses and households um according
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
to a recent new future survey 53% of
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters are worried about
 
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
affording their prescriptions and one in
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
four Granite Staters skip doses are
 
00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:05.799 align:start position:0%
ration their medications due to high
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
costs state and local governments
 
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559 align:start position:0%
they're under increasing pressure
 
00:26:11.149 --> 00:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs are a major cost
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
driver in Medicaid and in public
 
00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:15.799 align:start position:0%
employee health plans small businesses
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
they struggle to stay competitive as
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
health insurance premiums rise and it
 
00:26:20.669 --> 00:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
makes it harder for them to hire and
 
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
retain workers um families are also
 
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
having to make very challenging
 
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
decisions um many Granite Staters are
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
forced to deplete their safe take on
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
credit card debt or delay necessary care
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
due to the high cost of prescription
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
drugs which we just we don't see as
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
sustainable um the cost Trends indicate
 
00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:39.799 align:start position:0%
continued strain on our economy unless
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
we are able to take proactive measures
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
and so this is where the P dab comes in
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
um Slide Five I'll now walk you through
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
um some slides just to give you an
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
overview of our budget request and who
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
so starting on page six um the
 
00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:04.039 align:start position:0%
governor's budget maintains stable
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
funding it allows the board to continue
 
00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
its critical work um our budget is
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
on all of this work um but despite these
 
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
limited resources the PAB is already
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
identified savings um which proves the
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
value of continued investment and if
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
your intention is to continue funding
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
the board and we hope you do um we did
 
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
distribute a technical amendment that
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
would uh continue the executive director
 
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
position um so the board would have
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
stable leadership and staff to execute
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
on its Mission and so by continuing to
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
fund the PAB we are signaling to Granite
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
Staters that we hear them and we take
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
their concerns seriously ly um moving on
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
to slides eight and nine um the board we
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
operate transparently all of our
 
00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:08.519 align:start position:0%
meetings are live stream and open to the
 
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
public um we regularly engage
 
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders across the healthc care
 
00:28:14.909 --> 00:28:14.919 align:start position:0%
system um the PAB is comprised of
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
legislators Health economists
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
pharmacists lay experts which really
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
helps to ensure that there's a broad um
 
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
range of perspectives we have regular
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
meetings that um allow for that type of
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement and helps to
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that we stay ahead of emerging
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
affordability challenges um all of our
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
materials presentations reports all of
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
our decisions it's all publicly
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
available um and on our website um I'll
 
00:28:43.509 --> 00:28:43.519 align:start position:0%
then jump to uh slide 10 we're going to
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to want to come back to
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
seven but keep going okay um you're fine
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
for now keep going I just don't want to
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
overlook seven okay I'll make a note of
 
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.830 align:start position:0%
overlook seven okay I'll make a note of
it

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:56.919 align:start position:0%
um slide 10 that provides an overview of
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
the pabs authority
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
um in our reporting uh M uh chairman
 
00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
Edwards mentioned you know our our
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
primary objective is making cost saving
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations to public payers in the
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
legislature um but this is some of the
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
the things that we're test with doing um
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
slides 11 through 14 as already made
 
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
mention uh it uh details The Advisory
 
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
Council so the stakeholder advisory
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
Council was established last year and it
 
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
ensures the board's work is reflective
 
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799 align:start position:0%
of State leaders representing a diverse
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
CR section of state government that all
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
touch on prescription drugs in some way
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
um and the members really helped to
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
guide the work of the board and ensure
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
that key voices have a seat at the table
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
um moving on to slides 15 through 17
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
these slides are intended to provide you
 
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
with key insights that we uncovered in
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
our 2024 analysis as you can see the top
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
25 prescription drugs they're brand name
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
drugs and they accounted for 44% of
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
total prescription drug spending
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
revealing a small number of drugs are
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
driving increased costs and so
 
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
understanding these Trends is critical
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
for negotiating better rates ensuring
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
competition and protecting New Hampshire
 
00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:09.799 align:start position:0%
taxpayers this year's report will
 
00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:11.559 align:start position:0%
incorporate prescription drug spending
 
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:13.519 align:start position:0%
under the medical benefit which is a
 
00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559 align:start position:0%
growing area of concern that is highly
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
concentrated with high cost biologics
 
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
and provider administered drugs so so
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
spend a little time there for the
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
education of the members yes uh the
 
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
medical benefit how does that compare to
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
the to to what we're already looking at
 
00:30:33.389 --> 00:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
we would all assume a medical benefit
 
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
comes from all Pharmaceuticals but
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
you're making a distinction here right
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
thank you um so we analyze prescription
 
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
drug spending under the pharmacy benefit
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
and Pharmacy benefits are typically
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
administered by entities called Pharmacy
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
benefit managers they are middlemen who
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
negotiate rebates in secret they have
 
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
their own pricing strategies it's often
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
very challenging to know what you're
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
actually paying at the end of the day
 
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
but the all of that is administered
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
under a PBM they have no fiduciary duty
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
so they have no fiduciary duty to the
 
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
employer to the plan sponsor they simply
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
administer that benefit and this is all
 
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
of the drugs that you would get at your
 
00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:12.919 align:start position:0%
CVS your Walgreens all the retail stuff
 
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
the medical benefit is often provided
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
separately than the pharmacy benefit and
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
medical the medical benefit would
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
capture spending in hospital spending in
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
a under a bundled payment in Medicare or
 
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
um an outpatient facility all of those
 
00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:30.519 align:start position:0%
types of drugs provider administered
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
drugs infusions IVs those types of drugs
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
it the medical benefit is this is
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
getting weedy but it's very complex in
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
the terms of how of the claims that are
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
coming in it's not just by NDC which is
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
typically how the claims come in under
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy benefit under the medical
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
benefit it's hipi both acronyms NDC NDC
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
is the National Drug code every
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
prescription drug has a National Drug
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
code it's an identifier for the drug
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
right and then um under the medical
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
benefit you have the healthc care
 
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
procedures codes hips um those relate to
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
procedures and then within them there
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
are certain prescription drugs for that
 
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
procedure that takes a more work and
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
effort but we we have done the crosswalk
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
and so we are we are incorporating that
 
00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:17.559 align:start position:0%
spending under the pharmacy benefit I
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
mean under the prescription drug spend
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
for this um upcoming report um but they
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
those are kind of two different ways of
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
administering how we pay for
 
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.039 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs one really relies on
 
00:32:30.269 --> 00:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
rebates that's the pharmacy benefit and
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
the medical benefit that's often paid
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
off of like the average sales price in
 
00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
Medicare or something right okay um so
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
just moving on to our accomplishments as
 
00:32:46.029 --> 00:32:46.039 align:start position:0%
I mentioned at the uh top of the hour uh
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
we identified $6 million in savings
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
using the Medicare maximum fair prices
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
as a benchmark um we also modeled
 
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
spending on Humira which only recently
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
had a biosimilar launch it in enjoyed
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
well over 20 years of patent protection
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
um and is still our number one top
 
00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:06.919 align:start position:0%
spending drug even after bio simers were
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
introduced into the market and so that
 
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
led uh to legislation act that is active
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
in the house right now um that would
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
help to improve competition among
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
approved biosimilars which is a very
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
very expensive category of drugs um and
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
then we're in the process of vetting and
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
formalizing a recommendation for a
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
pharmacy first discount card um that
 
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
would be no cost to the state open to
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
all Granite Staters um and based on
 
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
Connecticut's experience we could save
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
up to about $240 per script um and with
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
how many people they have enrolled in
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
the program that's $1.23 million that's
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
cash pay that's people that are maybe in
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
a high deductible health plan or their
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
drug was dropped from their formulary
 
00:33:51.789 --> 00:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
those it would help really benefit those
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
who are underinsured or uninsured were
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
on fixed incomes retirees those types of
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
Po so two question questions on this on
 
00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
page 18 again for the education of folks
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
the distinction between biosimilars and
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
uh generics yes generics are small
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
molecule pills um so there are brand
 
00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
name small molecule Drugs That's you
 
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
know Advil Tylenol um anything that's a
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
pill or a tablet is a small molecule
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
then biologics are large molecule drugs
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
those are provider administered IVs um
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
you can think of drugs like Kuda or Huma
 
00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
those are biologics um they biosimilars
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
are you can think of them as the generic
 
00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
to a biologic um they have a much longer
 
00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
Market exclusivity period they enjoy
 
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
much longer terms of patent protection
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
and so and the litigation for biosimilar
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
entjer the market is a much higher bar
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
than what it is for generics so we are
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
we have not seen the entry or the
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
competition among biosimilars manifest
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
like they have for generics but we're
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
doing every thing we can at the state
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
level to help facilitate that and in
 
00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
general is it easier to get information
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
on the generics than it is the
 
00:35:08.829 --> 00:35:08.839 align:start position:0%
biosimilars or or what what what is
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
what's the source of our biosimilar uh
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
pricing yeah anything that would come in
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
through claims you know once once the
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
drug is approved um then it would either
 
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
be covered or not covered by a formulary
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
um and then we would be able to analyze
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
that spending we didn't have any claims
 
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
for any bio similar for Huma last year
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
but it was only introduced last we
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
analyzed 2023 data that's the only
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
complete most recent data we had last
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
year so this year's analysis we'll be
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
able to see or measure what was the
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
biosimilar uptake um but there are other
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
distortions within that market that may
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
limit competition but we for another day
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
referring to claims do you mean Medicaid
 
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.079 align:start position:0%
claims or also commercial claims the
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
commercial claims so the state and local
 
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
employee plans that we um are TK
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
providing recommendations to all of that
 
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
data is submitted to the all paer claims
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
database and so we leverage that
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
database for our spending analyses okay
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
and then the third bullet um sure
 
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
what department or how would the state
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
Implement that if that were to be uh
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
chosen would is there already like the
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
department of insurance or somebody
 
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
would receive this as a task to make
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
happen or would the how how would we
 
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
Implement that right I think that that's
 
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a question that we are
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
hoping to address in our upcoming board
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
meeting um we have had productive
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
conversations with the governor's office
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
she's vetting it she has her staff
 
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
vetting it um you know that could be
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
something we take on but it okay okay um
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
and then you know looking ahead you we
 
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
are eager to work with the legislature
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
and uh the governor on launching this
 
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
discount card for all Granite Staters uh
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
we'll continue to issue recommendations
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
on prescription drugs that may pose
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
affordability challenges we're
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
strengthening our inter departmental
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
collaboration to facilitate data sharing
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
minimize redundancies um and then we are
 
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
also help um exploring opportunities to
 
00:37:09.069 --> 00:37:09.079 align:start position:0%
strengthen Pharmacy benefit manager
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
Contracting and transparency
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
requirements um so there's a lot of work
 
00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
under way um we have really appreciated
 
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
the support chairman Edwards you have
 
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
been very helpful in establishing our
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
processes and policies and and getting
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
us to a place where we feel like we are
 
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
empowered to make these recommendations
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to acknowledge that
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
sure and and for the people who have
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
been tracking this for four years there
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
was some initial concern about
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
redundancies and I think in this last
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
year we've cleaned up some of the
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
redundancy issue by clarifying that the
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
board does not collect data and store
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
data it relies on existing procedures
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
and departments to do all of that and
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
that you submit sort of a data analysis
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
request instead of owning the data and
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
the risk associated with it so so that
 
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
was a huge concern about redundancy that
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
I think you could have shown as uh an
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
accomplishment yeah thank you I yeah we
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
we did go through that exercise last
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
year with the insurance department um
 
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
and presented that in December to the
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
HHS committee all right uh
 
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels thank you Mr
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
chairman how does this proposed uh
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
pharmacy discount card differ from
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
something like good RX or an a discount
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
card or any other on yeah that's a
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
really great question um so RX um not
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
many people know this but it sells all
 
00:38:33.069 --> 00:38:33.079 align:start position:0%
of your data so every time you use your
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
claims they they package all that up and
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
they sell it to pbms they sell it to
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturers they sell it to
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
advertisers um so and they also charge
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
pharmacies every time they run that card
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not they that the patient
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
actually picks that prescription up the
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacy's getting charged with this
 
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
card it is state-backed it is
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
administered by Oregon and Washington
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
jointly it's overseen by public servants
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
it does not charge Pharmacy for every
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
transaction it is privacy first it does
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
not sell anybody's data um we would only
 
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
receive you know aggregate this is how
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
much we saved but we wouldn't even get
 
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
demographic data um they take privacy
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
very seriously and I think that is
 
00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
reflective of our values here in New
 
00:39:17.069 --> 00:39:17.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that is how it
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
differs do all do all discount cards
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
work the same way um most of them work
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
like how good RX does yeah mhm and but
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
and you can go online you can go online
 
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
and can compare um the rates that you
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
would get under good RX and you can this
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
this card would be administered by array
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
RX that's that's the entity's name um
 
00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079 align:start position:0%
and so you can go in there um all
 
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacies are actually participate in
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
aray rx's network already in New
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we just don't haven't launched
 
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
that card we just haven't done it yet so
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
it's another tool in the toolbox for
 
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
consumers to help AFF their prescription
 
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
drugs particularly if they're changing
 
00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
jobs or if they find themselves without
 
00:39:58.109 --> 00:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
employment or living fixed income this
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
is just another way to help
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
them represent
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
tki thank you for taking my question um
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
I believe tomorrow the full house is
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
going to vote on House Bill 570 which is
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
sponsored by the chairman and there is a
 
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment I'm wondering if you
 
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:14.839 align:start position:0%
could speak to that and the impact of
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
that Amendment thank you right and and
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
be and before you do let me round out
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
your question please uh I submitted two
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
bills I I submitted HB 570 and HB
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
645 64 5 was much more procedural we're
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
also voting on it it it it was it was
 
00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a deeper into how we do business
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
uh for the pdab and that came out of
 
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
committee 17 to nothing U so so I I
 
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
think that was good policy that we put
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
together with the help of uh The
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
Honorable Gary Merchant and others uh
 
00:40:53.069 --> 00:40:53.079 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
570 uh was a kind of a simple Bill to
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
change some definitions I think and the
 
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
committee decided that they would amend
 
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
it to repeal the pdab AL together so so
 
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
tomorrow it's it's like we have to
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
decide are we repealing or are we fixing
 
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
and and that and that's kind of what the
 
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
the the the bigger question is for
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and and now with that you you
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
know please answer your question on on
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
what you think about those yeah I'll do
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
the best I can um you're right we we had
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
two bills we um were hoping to pass
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
through the legislature thank thank you
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative Edwards and yeah the
 
00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is unfortunate it passed out
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
um on party lines um we would we would
 
00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
lose um one of the the only independent
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
Watchdog of prescription drug prices in
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um all of this work that
 
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
we have put in to standing the board up
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
to modeling savings to building this up
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
over time tracking our spending making
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations even if we may not have
 
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
made a voluminous amount of
 
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations we are beginning to do
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
so when I have highlighted those here
 
00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
today um we all the work that we are
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
doing to help launch a prescription drug
 
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
discount card all of that stops all of
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
this work stops we wouldn't have anybody
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
that is making recommendations to State
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
and local employee plans I would also
 
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
note that um there are two municipal
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
risk pools that are on the brink of
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
insolvency and this is a challenge that
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
we are working to to help but that
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
magnifies or shows just how big of an
 
00:42:33.309 --> 00:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
impact Rising prescription drug costs
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
are on this state and the proposed
 
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
solutions would increase cost really
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
would increase property taxes um because
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
of the risk of insolvency and so if we
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
can help these plans get a better spend
 
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
or negotiate better rates uh then we can
 
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
help decrease that tax burden but
 
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
without it nobody nobody's there to step
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
in and perform that oversight function
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
or bring the transparency to the market
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
like we're able
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
welcome so I I'll I'll I'll come over um
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
okay I going into today's hearing and
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
and the LA the last couple of months uh
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
talking with the the chair of the board
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
um I I tried to make it very clear that
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh the Investments that we've made into
 
00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
the board so far I would consider in
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
financial terms to be sunk costs I'm not
 
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:32.839 align:start position:0%
I'm not interested in going back and and
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
reexamining all of that because I know
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
how we got there but but going forward
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of things there's
 
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
there's um 645 has a fiscal note that
 
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
adds about $100,000 a year and the
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
purpose of that 100,000 is so that the
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
board can uh establish and operate a due
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
process uh mechanism so that when the
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
board sends questions to the private
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
sector the private sector has an
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to respond that that's in
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
645 and that's the fiscal note do you do
 
00:44:11.549 --> 00:44:11.559 align:start position:0%
you so my question on this now yeah yeah
 
00:44:13.549 --> 00:44:13.559 align:start position:0%
yeah is because we don't have any money
 
00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:16.599 align:start position:0%
this year right uh would if if we were
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
to delay the board were to delay
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
um querying the private sector we could
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
defer the 100 ,000 needed to set up a
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
due process sure is so how how do you
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
respond to the idea that that when we do
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
see 645 right um that uh an amendment
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate to defer that you
 
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
we have to have it when the board starts
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
to ask the questions yes yes absolutely
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
great question glad you asked it um that
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
that was assuming um we were we would
 
00:44:59.390 --> 00:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
have to add uh add additional Personnel
 
00:45:02.109 --> 00:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
um I hadn't talked with the insurance
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
department um if we're able to establish
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
the m and work with um the insurance
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
department or any other state agency on
 
00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
conducting a data call then we wouldn't
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily incur $100,000 we would
 
00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
leverage their um their existing
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um but we don't have I'm
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
the only staff member and aside from all
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
of all the work I'm doing um I I it
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
would it was unfeasible to think that we
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
could do that un funded but with working
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
with the insurance department I think we
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
can do it um without adding costs okay
 
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to speak for DJ you you
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
think you could take that fiscal note
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
down to zero and therefore you could
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
start making queries of the private
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
sector while still creating a due
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
process challenge
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely all
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
right we when we if we get 645 we should
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
talk about that okay okay so so the
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
other second thing is so I was looking
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
at this as an investment of like $550
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
million over the two years and given
 
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
that there was a a thousand
 
00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
excuse at least I didn't say billions
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
whoa I'm GNA be rich yeah 550,000 sorry
 
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
um so um so I wanted a clear business
 
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
case right so that we could demonstrate
 
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
to the public because we've got the
 
00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
house position on on 570 is to repeal
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
the board right well so so so what I
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
think we need is a a really clear
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
business case to show how that
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
$550,000 would return a a rate of uh
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
would be there would be a return on that
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
investment sort of a classic ROI
 
00:46:51.549 --> 00:46:51.559 align:start position:0%
analysis of this is what we're spending
 
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
here here is something that we think and
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
this will deliver so we can deliver this
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
at the end of this two-year
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
budget right um it we I think it's
 
00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
important to remind the committee we
 
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
don't have enforcement Authority so
 
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
there's we can't force anybody to take
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
our recommendations um I provided
 
00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:15.559 align:start position:0%
savings estimates we will continue to do
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
that Medicare is negotiating 15 more
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
drugs this year we'll do 15 next year so
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
that was 25 drugs this year that we'll
 
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
estimate savings on um and this is
 
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
stimulating a conversation about are we
 
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
over spending on prescription drugs and
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
if some so so I just need an Excel sheet
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
where you make a business case and I
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
know that you're not the one that makes
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
the decision but we need to be able to
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrate how we think we're going to
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
um make this investment
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
payoff so uh is are there questions over
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
here representative PR thank you so much
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
for recognizing me thank you for being
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
here um some of some of my questions
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
have been answered before but um I'm on
 
00:48:04.109 --> 00:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
Medicare and I buy a
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
prescription coverage through Edna y do
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
they also sell my information to
 
00:48:11.359 --> 00:48:14.190 align:start position:0%
they also sell my information to
pharmacies

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacies
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
and as as a l what whatever that uh sure
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
a discount card discount cards would do
 
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
that I I no Etna would not be selling
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
your data the V first pharmacy discount
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
card is not out yet no and it's not
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
insurance it's not Insurance okay yeah
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
and the second thing is uh the number
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
550 um 550,000 has been floating around
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
here but your budget for 2026 and 2027
 
00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.670 align:start position:0%
here but your budget for 2026 and 2027
is

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
256,000 per per year per year so you're
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
talking about 550 for two years yes okay
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
right right um and we we have
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate we have uh money for
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
contracts for pro program Services
 
00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:05.079 align:start position:0%
65,000 which is um I'm not I'm not
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
convinced that we're able to get a
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
contract off the ground for that amount
 
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
but we are a lapsing fund so we didn't
 
00:49:14.589 --> 00:49:14.599 align:start position:0%
spend 65,000 that goes back into the
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
state Coffer so that's even it could be
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
less and the third question I have is
 
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
you have approximated about $6 million
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
do in savings um
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
do you have the number of Gran estaters
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
that have participated so far in this
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
program no no no and there's no way you
 
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
can do that no we we were modeling the
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
savings based on the Medicare negotiated
 
00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:46.839 align:start position:0%
prices compared to what the estimated
 
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
prices are that we're getting now but no
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
one is in that program their estimates
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
on how many Medicare beneficiaries are
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
benefiting um and we included that in
 
00:49:56.789 --> 00:49:56.799 align:start position:0%
the report you you have yes we have
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
included that in the report the Medicare
 
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
Savings yeah and in this slideshow not
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
in the slide deck no could you uh just
 
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
give me that information that would be
 
00:50:05.319 --> 00:50:06.190 align:start position:0%
give me that information that would be
very

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you
 
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
yeah other
 
00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.270 align:start position:0%
yeah other
questions

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
okay uh repes representative Nano yeah
 
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thank you uh we
 
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
we spoke in the hallway yes I way a full
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
disclosure before the uh before the
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
session so I'm going to build on I think
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative seaw Worth's question and
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
as well as uh representative priests so
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
what we've got here is a basically the
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
Six Million is a
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
theoretical number of potential savings
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
and so the question and I think it also
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
relates to what chairman Edwards was
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
saying I don't see you know what's the
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
mechanism for you being able to ident
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
identify how much of the potential
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
savings however you're you're defining
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
that that we're actually realizing and I
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
would imagine that U there's a
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
significant P I don't know what the
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
number is of uninsured or sure um uh
 
00:51:16.829 --> 00:51:16.839 align:start position:0%
underinsured people and it's not clear
 
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
that how how you reach those people I
 
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
know you reach out to for example the
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
state employees unions and I guess and
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
provide them with yeah information
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
on uh affordability or where where the
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
cost structure is detrimental so and
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
then as a second question in in your
 
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
presentation package here you show a a I
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
guess a a calculated number of $241 per
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
scrip and uh I'm guessing and maybe you
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
can tell me where that number comes from
 
00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
because I'm guessing that it's on the
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
really high price
 
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
yeah um prescription drugs but not
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
really a representative average of a
 
00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
full spectrum of drugs that people use
 
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
sure surek um so for the first question
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
you know we are providing directional um
 
00:52:13.789 --> 00:52:13.799 align:start position:0%
uh information that can point you
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
directionally to in foreign policies now
 
00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
you all are the policy-making entity we
 
00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
we are empowering you all with the data
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
we are empowering plan sponsors to go
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
back to their pbms and say well you know
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
the PAB model these savings and we're
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
not getting the best discount or why are
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
we not getting that price they they can
 
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
be they can go to their plan sponsor and
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
ask that we are empowering them to do so
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
um and then we are also we want to work
 
00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
with all of you to figure out what is
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
the right mechanism we currently in
 
00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
statute don't have that mechanism but we
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
are we would love to explore that and we
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
are we we are working um over time to
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
get there um uh your question about the
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
uninsured so our recommendations by
 
00:52:58.270 --> 00:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
Statute um are for state and local
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
employee plans not
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
uninsured that has been so that kind of
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
limits our reach um and that's a that's
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
a policy decision but I think we would
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
we would also um welcome the opportunity
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
to help folks that are uninsured as well
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
but um that was the uninsured question
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
241 per script yes that um the card
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
saves on average about 80% for generics
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
20% for Brands um when I was talking to
 
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
Connecticut about their experience
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
they're seeing a lot of folks use it for
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
maintenance medications for chronic
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
conditions um often Medicaid doesn't
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
cover OTC or over-the-counter drugs so
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
there are Medicaid recipients that have
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
to go and use that card um to afford
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
their their prescription drugs um so
 
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:47.799 align:start position:0%
they are also hearing a lot from folks
 
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
with high deductible health plans that
 
00:53:51.549 --> 00:53:51.559 align:start position:0%
they are using that card a lot for some
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
of their drugs that when they have seen
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
that it's gone um off their formulary so
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
I I don't have a specific names of the
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
drugs but I I those are hopefully can
 
00:54:04.109 --> 00:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
give you a sense of who is using it and
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
for what reasons what kind of drugs a
 
00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:07.789 align:start position:0%
for what reasons what kind of drugs a
quick

00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:07.799 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
follow a quick okay so I am the the the
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
protocol is once you have the floor as
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
long as you're asking relevant questions
 
00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:18.799 align:start position:0%
just have a conversation so keep going I
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
hope it's a relevant question but not be
 
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
able to tell so the savings and
 
00:54:26.789 --> 00:54:26.799 align:start position:0%
everything the recently there was a you
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
know the a cut in what they're able to
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
charge for something like insulin yeah
 
00:54:34.789 --> 00:54:34.799 align:start position:0%
which is a you know an ongoing cut so is
 
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
that reflected in or still something
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at so um so yeah the
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
insulin issue um that if everybody
 
00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:47.799 align:start position:0%
remembers um three manufacturers
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
controlled insulin and over the period
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
of about a decade the price increased
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
600% um individuals were rationing in
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
insulin which is a life-saving
 
00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
medication um due to a lot of public
 
00:55:03.309 --> 00:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
pressure um a lot of states started to
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
cap co-pays on prescript on insulin
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
themselves um and so we have done that
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire New Hampshire has
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
capped out- of pocket costs um and the
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturers again due to a lot of
 
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
scrutiny at the federal and state level
 
00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
um they did voluntarily lower their
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
prices but that's not necessarily
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
reflected in this report thank you okay
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay I and I want to the point that was
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
uh made here on
 
00:55:32.839 --> 00:55:34.630 align:start position:0%
uh made here on
um

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
645 expands the scope of what the pdab
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
can look at because we didn't have the
 
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to to get the
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections money and I
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
think that was one of the things that uh
 
00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:52.359 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and I and
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
Senator uh Ros Rosenwald wanted to make
 
00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
more clear so so with 645 we included
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
Corrections and to the extent that there
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
are other
 
00:56:08.029 --> 00:56:08.039 align:start position:0%
categories we can always expand the the
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
the the scope if it's appropriate Absol
 
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and that's that's a great
 
00:56:15.069 --> 00:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
point and with the with the ARR RX
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
discount card they also have a voucher
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
program um that is available to
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
correction facilities so that would give
 
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
folks that are re-entering the community
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
a voucher to help afford their
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs and ensure a
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
continuity of care and that's something
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
that we can look into and would be maybe
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
a future recommendation that we would
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
make all right so representative cworth
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
and then representative Stringham did
 
00:56:37.789 --> 00:56:37.799 align:start position:0%
you still have a
 
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
question I I think I'll wait for now
 
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman I'd like to
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
jump back to the
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
$65,000 contract it sounds to me like
 
00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
you've established a need you haven't
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
found a way to fulfill it and then
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
apparently you're somehow doing without
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
right now so I'd like to understand
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
what's going on and yeah yeah yeah um we
 
00:57:04.029 --> 00:57:04.039 align:start position:0%
have yeah the line item for contract for
 
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
program Services um we since we only
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
have uh one staff member um additional
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
Consulting manpower to expand the bench
 
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
of folks that are able to help
 
00:57:17.069 --> 00:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
operationalize the spending Target and
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
reviewing this data helping to make the
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations we we are looking to
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
procure expert Services um I some of the
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
feedback I've gotten from from folks
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
that would bid for this has said it's
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
far too low um so we may not be able to
 
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
actually get it out the door but um we
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
are working with the contracts
 
00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
department and I would also note that um
 
00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:41.039 align:start position:0%
we have the extra requirement of having
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
every contract approved by the fiscal
 
00:57:47.029 --> 00:57:47.039 align:start position:0%
Committee in addition to GNC so unlike
 
00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
every other board in the state we have
 
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
that additional requirement um so that
 
00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
slows our ability down to actually get
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
it out the door or get the assurances
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
for folks to bid that you know it's
 
00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.039 align:start position:0%
worth their
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
time yeah representative Stringham is
 
00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839 align:start position:0%
this later do you want to ask your
 
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
question now represent Daniels thank you
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
in addition to discount cards are you
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
also looking at other discount programs
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
like uh Cost Plus drugs that's a great
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
question um Cost Plus drugs um
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
established by Mark cubin um that's
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
largely a generic relabeling company um
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
that we could explore you know how plan
 
00:58:27.069 --> 00:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
sponsors could work work more closely
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
with Mark Cuban's Cost Plus drugs
 
00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
company um that's a different type of
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursement framework but I think it
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
shows that there is a problem with how
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
drugs are priced because he does show
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
very transparently what is the cost of
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
goods and how much is the drug or how
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
much is it going down over time whereas
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
other manufacturers don't do that and I
 
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
think it's a great effort in
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
transparency it doesn't solve the issues
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
that are facing the plans but it could
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
be one way we could help bring about
 
00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
savings I think that's a great
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
idea all right um okay so uh we said we
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.359 --> 00:59:17.190 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
yep go ahead go ahead you
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
want I thought you had a question I'm
 
00:59:22.319 --> 00:59:23.950 align:start position:0%
want I thought you had a question I'm
sorry

00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
is yes sorry these are um explaining in
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
kind of more detail uh some of the line
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
items in our budget so there are General
 
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
administrative functions for for example
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
one state issued cell phone um that
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
helps ensure compliance um and
 
00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
safeguards you know my email any any
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
sort of documentation um this helps to
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh underneath this umbrella you know we
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
are able to tap into Regulatory and
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
policy resources and also helps to
 
00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:54.280 align:start position:0%
support um the software tools for data
 
00:59:57.309 --> 00:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
analysis and Reporting and um another I
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
may have failed to mention this we are
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
an independent entity that is
 
01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to DHHS so we
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
share and we we reimburse them for the
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
costs that we incur so um some of this
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
funding does help cover those costs and
 
01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:11.799 align:start position:0%
so we don't have and we don't have you
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
know staff that we pay um then we have
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
travel and uh professional development
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
that allows for attendance at one state
 
01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
policy conference um notably the
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
National Academy for State Health policy
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
um most recently I was nominated to um
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
to the academy actually and I'm on the
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
coverage cost thank you and I'm on the
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
coverage cost and value steering
 
01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
committee you're probably on some cover
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
of a magazine
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
too um maybe one day um only if you
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
found me um and it allows for a meeting
 
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders um engagement in
 
01:00:46.029 --> 01:00:46.039 align:start position:0%
National Pol policy discussions last
 
01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
year I attended a legal conference in
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
Washington DC by nashby to help stay up
 
01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
to dat on current um legal is 5,500 too
 
01:00:56.589 --> 01:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
much I I've gone to lots of conferences
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
and I never spend anywhere near that I'm
 
01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.750 align:start position:0%
and I never spend anywhere near that I'm
a

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
$2500 trip guy yeah part of this is um
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
yeah the I think the for that conference
 
01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
is something like $750 and then there's
 
01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
you know airfare and hotel but it's also
 
01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
instate travel out of state travel I I
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
meet with stakeholders I travel across
 
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
the state to meet with with folks all um
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
so that helps reimburse that um and then
 
01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
we we touched on programmatic support
 
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
and we're currently at 65,000 a year for
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
contracts okay so this programmatic
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
support this is if you issue to the
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance or request to do
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
some sort of new data query or to do
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
some data analis it for that if is that
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
what this is for I mean well it wasn't
 
01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:46.839 align:start position:0%
intended for that it was intended for
 
01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
you know Consulting expertise many many
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
departments boards they they you know
 
01:01:53.789 --> 01:01:53.799 align:start position:0%
have contractors that assist and assist
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
with data analysis now if we needed to
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
do that then you know we could maybe
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
repurpose it for that function yeah okay
 
01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:03.559 align:start position:0%
so so my thought has been that so far
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
we've been living off of the largess and
 
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
generosity of uh the other state
 
01:02:10.349 --> 01:02:10.359 align:start position:0%
departments that that they've incurred
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
costs to support the establishment of
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
which no money has been transferred to
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
compensate them for it and so we have we
 
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
have we have anou that does cover the
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
but weent money um that would be a
 
01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
question for Nathan how that
 
01:02:28.029 --> 01:02:28.039 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how that gets done I
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
don't think we have but okay so um all
 
01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
right so so that seems fairly reasonable
 
01:02:37.269 --> 01:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other
 
01:02:37.279 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other
questions

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:38.290 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:39.829 align:start position:0%
questions
[Music]

01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Merchant are do you do you have
 
01:02:45.069 --> 01:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
anything to say to us I mean you you
 
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
you've got the most skin in this game
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
you've been doing this for over four
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
years is there anything you want to add
 
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
and the reason I'm belaboring this to
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
some people think I'm belaboring it is
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
because we have a
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate um effort to repeal the board
 
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
while at the same time we have a
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
legitimate interest in this being a
 
01:03:09.549 --> 01:03:09.559 align:start position:0%
successful board right so this is just a
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
much bigger decision I think than you
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
know a half a million dollars over two
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
years it's a bigger decision but go go
 
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
ahead um The Honorable Gary Merchant
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh for the record my
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
name is Gary Merchant
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm the chair of the prescription
 
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
affordability board I am pleased that we
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
have executive director Kurt Williamson
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
here today to answer a lot of your
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions I would say we're at the cusp
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
of fundamentally do we try to continue
 
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
supporting the board with the work
 
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
that's been done and continue to work on
 
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
prescription Dr pricing affordability
 
01:03:53.549 --> 01:03:53.559 align:start position:0%
for the residents of our state of New
 
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's the one of the number one
 
01:03:59.069 --> 01:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
issues in healthare cost we on the cusp
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
of making some really good
 
01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations to different entities
 
01:04:07.269 --> 01:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
we've put a lot we as a state we've put
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of effort in resources in getting
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
the board up to where it is today until
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Williamson came on board in January
 
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.349 align:start position:0%
Mr Williamson came on board in January
of

01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
2024 we couldn't really up stand up the
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
board so I think to your point chair Mr
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
chairman it's at the point of let's
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
road give the board the
 
01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring the recommendations
 
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
forward see where they go $6 million
 
01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:40.119 align:start position:0%
potential savings with a lot of money a
 
01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
discount card that could save our
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
citizens over $1 million a year a
 
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
voucher program these are only the
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
beginning of what we're finding so as we
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
go down the road and begin to analyze
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
the data we're finding more and more
 
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
things in the more we find the more we
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
can bring forward recommendations so my
 
01:05:00.119 --> 01:05:00.990 align:start position:0%
can bring forward recommendations so my
thought

01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
is let's not fix it but continue down
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
that road for the benefit of our
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
citizens also for most importantly our
 
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers okay okay so when I ask for um
 
01:05:18.029 --> 01:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
a business case analysis on the specific
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations that there there's
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
something to it I I and and we're asking
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
you to be a jack of all trades right you
 
01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:27.559 align:start position:0%
you came to the board with a particular
 
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
background and
 
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
education you get asked to do a little
 
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
bit of everything well so if you if you
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
don't have any experience with business
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
case analysis i' I'd be happy to change
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
hats and help you as a board member to
 
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:46.039 align:start position:0%
get the right format together but but I
 
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
do think if this rolls into the Senate
 
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
that you you want to have much more
 
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
clarity about what the recommendation is
 
01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
you and and and and and how we're going
 
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
to make money doing it so
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
um yes if I could Mr
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
chair the return on investment there's
 
01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
two fold one is the fiscal side of it
 
01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
the other social and trying to look at
 
01:06:14.589 --> 01:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
it and saying what are we doing to help
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
our citizens in New Hampshire to make
 
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
drugs more affordable I totally agree
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
that we have to have a business case on
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
the fiscal side and that's critically
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
important but also Al not lose sight of
 
01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're trying to help out
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
many folks in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
to make prescription drugs more
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
affordable the discount card for
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
instance may not save the state itself
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
directly money but over a million
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in savings to the
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire is a
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money um when you
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
start looking at Department of
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
Corrections so there things we can do
 
01:06:52.589 --> 01:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
but I want to be clear with you folks
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
and everyone else yes we have to focus
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
from an Roi point of view but not lose
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
sight of the fact is also societal
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
impact see I see that I hear you I see
 
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
that as a distinction without a
 
01:07:07.269 --> 01:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
difference though I I think we can still
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
do a business case even if the state is
 
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
not uh directly benefiting from it
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
because this is all state money so if
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
we're improve if we're making things
 
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
better for the taxpayer through some
 
01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
other mechanism I I I think it all all
 
01:07:23.549 --> 01:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
we're talk all I'm talking about is
 
01:07:26.349 --> 01:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
visibility and transparency so that when
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
people want to know exactly what the
 
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
benefit of this program is you can lay
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
out some some some hardcore numbers that
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
that that that's what I'm hoping you get
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
to and I think we're on the same page Mr
 
01:07:42.029 --> 01:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
chairman and I want to say also
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
recognize um it wasn't so much in the
 
01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
report but with your guidance and your
 
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
oversight that the issue of the data um
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
and having the ability for the board to
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
get available data and at that point in
 
01:07:57.269 --> 01:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
time is the board not really being a
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
place to collect the data but being able
 
01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
to work with other state agencies that
 
01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
do collect the data so we don't have to
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel or build the
 
01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is be able to have what
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
they call a data call to go to them and
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
saying this is the data we need you have
 
01:08:13.269 --> 01:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
a something in place so we don't have to
 
01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:15.799 align:start position:0%
again be redundant right so thank you
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
for that you're sure I know it's been uh
 
01:08:20.829 --> 01:08:20.839 align:start position:0%
unpleasant because we've wanted to get
 
01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
to the same point but we've been bumping
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
into each other the whole for four years
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
so uh representative Stringham well
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
first of all I want to say thank you for
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
all the hard work and and progress
 
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
that's been made I I was uh considerably
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
frustrated two years ago because going
 
01:08:41.309 --> 01:08:41.319 align:start position:0%
through um line by line in details of
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
the budget uh we realized that
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs is a huge percentage
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
of the Medicaid budget and we spent
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
maybe all of 15 minutes on that uh out
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
of the weeks and weeks that we comb
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
through the budget virtually no uh
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
ability to impact what is prescribed or
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
how much we pay for it and um so you
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
know I I look at you know these last
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
three pages that are that are in there
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
that we have a
 
01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
relatively um small number of drugs
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
costing 60,000 plus uh per patient a
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
year um you mostly in here we're looking
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
at the Medicaid budget um but
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
um uh you know one of one of the
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
frustrate one of the
 
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh frustrations if that budget continues
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
to grow and consume a bigger bigger
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
piece of the Medicaid pie uh you know
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
sooner sooner or later uh the pi is can
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
overflow the the pin uh the tan pan
 
01:09:42.669 --> 01:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
thank you exactly right and and one of
 
01:09:44.829 --> 01:09:44.839 align:start position:0%
the bills unfortunately the bill that
 
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
was amended to repeal the board would
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
have expanded um our authority to also
 
01:09:52.749 --> 01:09:52.759 align:start position:0%
assist manid um and that was we we
 
01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
thought we uh were supposed to look at
 
01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but there's been differing
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
opinions on what the statute actually
 
01:10:00.669 --> 01:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
said and this would have fixed that so
 
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
we could have helped address a lot of
 
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
that what is a growing um line item in
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and um a recent report by the
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
um by macpac which is the Congressional
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
um advisory Council that um advises
 
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
Congress on Medicaid they documented
 
01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
that the cost of brand named drugs in
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid doubled from 2018 to
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
2022 um these prices are growing and as
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
more Gene therapies are coming to Market
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
at over a million dollars each a lot of
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
these Target Medicaid populations um so
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
I think that is another area of growing
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
concern and will'll add to budget
 
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
uncertainty over time if if not
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
addressed but we are we are here to help
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
address them we are here to be a
 
01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
resource for you and for other
 
01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
legislators um and the public and public
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
payers so there there there's not a lot
 
01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
in 570 um I mean the amendment obviously
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
is a big deal but but uh if 645
 
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
continues to
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
progress the legislative process will
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to amend U 645 so
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
that we don't lose the good stuff that's
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
in 570 so so it's not done we're in the
 
01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
middle of a we're we're still at the
 
01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
relatively beginning phase of a process
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
so all right uh if you don't have if I
 
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
don't see any other qu questions and I I
 
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
I think have you wrapped up because I I
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
I need to ask the audience if there's
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
anyone in the audience if they have want
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
to speak you
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
guys thank you this went longer than I
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated thank you Mr chair all right
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the committee okay is there anyone
 
01:11:37.629 --> 01:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
in the audience that wants to speak
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
anyone anyone
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
anyone okay so where are we at 2 o'clock
 
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
we're full finance committee uh down in
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
reps Hall um that that's expected to go
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
many many hours I wasn't able to verify
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh food is going to be
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
provided Ed if we go past 6 I think
 
01:11:59.470 --> 01:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
that's a house rule that the speaker or
 
01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
somebody can procure food if we go past
 
01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
6 um and then uh Thursday what do we do
 
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
on Thursday Madam Vice chair that's a
 
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
house session that's the house session
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
so so our next time that we're going to
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
get together is
 
01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
Monday has that been put in forward to
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
go into the house calendar yes it has so
 
01:12:23.709 --> 01:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
you'll meet Monday at 10:00 a.m. uh for
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
bills and that fourth bill still needs
 
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
to be added um the uh Bill relative to
 
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
the county county payments so if if they
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
really want to keep that then I just
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
want input to it and I I'll I'll work
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
that out but if it gets into being no I
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
want it I I don't want to fight over it
 
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
I just have we've dealt with that issue
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
more okay yeah Madam Vice chair yes
 
01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so we during that
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
last presentation we were distributed
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
statutory language I'm not sure that was
 
01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
discussed or if it should be discussed
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
but just thought I would bring that up
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
now since we were all given a hand out I
 
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
I think the value of the statutory
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
language was the was
 
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
the striketh through right the position
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
shall be effective the can I can I
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
address that yes sir um yes so um that
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
was included in HP 570 but this is a
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
technical Amendment um that for some
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
reason my position expires within 2
 
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
years of my hiring date so this would
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
just eliminate that 2year um term limit
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
essentially okay so I I think the the
 
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
people I've heard on this that
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
understand this better than me is is
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
that we should we should have I this is
 
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
a little personal um but but just
 
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
speaking at the policy level sure uh I
 
01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
think it's true that all positions in
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
the state basically continue and your
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
position is is recorded as permanent as
 
01:13:58.990 --> 01:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
is it not or is no no it's um you know
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
just like with any other position if if
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
the board's not funded I'm not funded um
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm not like permanently in statute
 
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
but but if if if it's continued to be
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
funded there's there's no ax getting
 
01:14:15.149 --> 01:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
ready to cut you there is there is there
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
if that because yeah if that's not fixed
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
that yeah then I that is the axe yeah
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
okay so all right if if uh if we get
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
um one of those bills in here we'll keep
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%

01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
question yes ma'am Mr Ripple would it be
 
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate that this amendment be part

of House Bill 2 in order to ensure that
